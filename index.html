	What if I made a textfile data structure that was just a big association matrix and stored ideas <br>
	directly like that. What if you could do something analogous to latex to think through this method <br>
	which is optimally stored and decoded by others? <br> <br>
	
	What if I used the Twitter API to grab my tweets(need to see if this is possible)<br> 
	and could parse them to update the association matrix each day <br> <br> 
	
	And I have an encoding system, a tweet format. Just basically writing code to write <br>
	in a way that's unbelievably systematic so that attacks and disagreements are nuanced. <br>
	The tension point is clearer. Write with graphs, not sentences?? <br> <br>
			
	Could probably have a flag to make it an encoded tweet. My code filters out normal tweets. Could be fun. <br> 
	A neat code notebook that's publicly built. Thinking aloud? Idk maybe this is something for an alt account <br> <br>
			
	And you can just import parts of the network and carry on Adding to that neighborhood of the association matrix <br> <br>
			
	How do I turn my tweets into Information geometry? Imagine a thought is just a flow through that information geometry, <br> 
	like dashes of light, electrons flowing through silicon... <br> 
	Topology, network connectivity: flows are of all kinds -- how to record "desiring machines" in data... <br> <br>
			
	Just store some proofs and point them at stuff after assigning them a name. Save chunks of text, explanations. <br>
	But make it such that you store it once then import it forever more. <br> <br>
			
	What I liked about code is that I could dig into exactly how it was all written out. <br> <br>
	
	This way one thinks precisely and resolutely. One can always be at the edge of ones knowledge. <br>
	One can revisit past ways of thinking and change them over time like it's a GitHub page with a definite history. <br> <br>
	
	And then figure out text AI to turn association networks like this into great prose???? <br>
	That speculation is offered. I don't know at all how that'd work. But what if you could <br>
	write technically and rigorously while being able to run it through some style generator <br> 
	so that it can be tailored to anyone's taste? <br> <br>
		
	Systematic neologisms for the thinker, the literary style of choice for the reader... <br> <br>
