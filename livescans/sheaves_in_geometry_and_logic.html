    <p>A startling aspect of topos theory is that it unifies two seemingly wholly distinct mathematical subjects: on the one hand, topology and algebraic geometry, and on the other hand, logic and set theory. Indeed, a topos can be considered both as a "generalized space" and as a "gereralized universe of sets". These different aspects arose independently around 1963: with A. Grothendieck in his reformulation of sheaf theory for algebraic geometry, with fF. W. Lawvere in his search for an axiomatization of the category of sets and that of "variable" sets, and with Paul Cohen in the use of forcing to construct new models of Zermelo-Fraenkel set theory. pg. 1</p>
    
    <p>The study of cohomology for generalized spaces led Grothendieck to define his notion of a topos. The cohomology was to be one with variable coefficients--for example, varying under the action of the fundamental group, as in N. E. Steenrod's work in algebraic topology, or, more generally, varying in a sheaf. The notion of a sheaf has its origins in the analytic continuation of functions, as initiated in the 19th century and then formulated rigorously in H. Weyl's famous book on the "idea" of the Riemann surface. pg 1</p>
