    <p>Buddhism is clearly a reaction against the excess of metaphysical speculation like that found in the oldest Upanishads. It is also opposed to the Vedic sacrificial system pg92</p>
    
    <p>The notion that life is suffering is, of course, present in many phases of Indian thought, but in Samkhya and Buddhism it is the foundation upon which the respective soteriologies are built. pg93</p>
    
    <p>Buddhism and Jainism had developed in eastern India by the 5th century BCE. It is probable that these schools of thought and the earliest schools of Samkhya influenced each other. pg91</p>
    
    <p>Eliade misses the truly unique contribution of Samkhya, and makes it, rather, into a mere imitation of Yoga pg63</p>
    
    <p>It is the nature or function of purusa to so appear, and, as a result, suffering is of the nature of things (svabhava). Thus, the emerence or evolution of the mainfest world out of mulaprakrti is for the sake of the purusa (purusurtha). pg176</p>
    
    <p>samkhya refers primarily to the idea of "number" Or "enumeration" but that it also signifies those who reason or analyze by means of the enumeration of categories. pg?</p>
