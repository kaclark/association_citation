    <p>the Spanda school takes its name from one of its root texts, namely, the Spandakarikd, the Stanzas on Vibration. pg20</p>
    
    <p>The philosophy of the Pratyabhijna focuses on the liberating recognition of the soul's authentic identity as Siva while the Doctrine of Vibration stresses instead the importance of experiencing Spanda, the vibration or pulse of consciousness. The mainstay of the Doctrine of Vibration is the contemplative experience the awakened yogi has of his true nature as the universal perceiving and acting consciousness. Every activity in the universe, as well as every perception, notion, sensation or emotion in the microcosm* ebbs and flows as part of the universal rhythm of the one reality, which is Siva, the one God Who is the pure conscious agent and perceiver. According to the Doctrine of Vibration, man can realise his true nature to be Siva by experiencing Spanda, the dynamic, recurrent and creative activity of the absolute. pg 20-21</p>
    
    <p>The Spanda school, like the Pratyabhijna, originated and developed in Kashmir through the works of known authors, not in anonymous Tantras. Indeed, the origins of this school mark the beginnings of Kashmiri Saivism in our modern sense of the term. pg21</p>
