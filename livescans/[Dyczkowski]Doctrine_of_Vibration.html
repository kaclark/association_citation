    <p>the Spanda school takes its name from one of its root texts, namely, the Spandakarikd, the Stanzas on Vibration. pg20</p>
    
    <p>The philosophy of the Pratyabhijna focuses on the liberating recognition of the soul's authentic identity as Siva while the Doctrine of Vibration stresses instead the importance of experiencing Spanda, the vibration or pulse of consciousness. The mainstay of the Doctrine of Vibration is the contemplative experience the awakened yogi has of his true nature as the universal perceiving and acting consciousness. Every activity in the universe, as well as every perception, notion, sensation or emotion in the microcosm* ebbs and flows as part of the universal rhythm of the one reality, which is Siva, the one God Who is the pure conscious agent and perceiver. According to the Doctrine of Vibration, man can realise his true nature to be Siva by experiencing Spanda, the dynamic, recurrent and creative activity of the absolute. pg 20-21</p>
    
    <p>The Spanda school, like the Pratyabhijna, originated and developed in Kashmir through the works of known authors, not in anonymous Tantras. Indeed, the origins of this school mark the beginnings of Kashmiri Saivism in our modern sense of the term. pg21</p>
    
    <p>The motion of absolute consciousness is a creative movement, a transition from the uncreated state of Being to the created state of Becoming. In this sense Being is in a state of perpetual Becoming (satatodita); it constantly
phenomenalises into finite expression. The shining of inner Being is the
manifestation of outer Becoming and, as such, is the constantly self-renewing source of its own appearing as Becoming. pg77</p>
    
    <p>Every event is a part of the greater rhythm of the total, cosmic event. Every object is part of the universal object and every subject shares in the agency of the universal subject. pg80</p>
    
    <p>Kashmiri Saivism maintains that all things are spontaneously emanated by consciousness in such a way that the original source of the emitted product remains unchanged and one with its emanation. The plenitude of universal manifestation emerges out of the fullness of the absolute; both are perfect expressions of the all-encompassing totality of reality which, thus emitting itself, suffers no loss. pg87</p>
    
    <p>Prior to their manifestation, all things reside within consciousness ina potential form just as in a peacock's egg, we find all the peacock's limbswith its feathers large and small, colours and patterns.85 pg 92</p>
    
    <p>Siva, the universal agent, eternally active is never bound by Hisactivity. The universe is the unfolding effect of Siva's agency (kartfpratha)while He, as the agent, always remains true to His essential, autonomousnature.124 The law of action and reaction {karma) binds only theignorant.125 At the lower level, outer activity contrasts with innerawareness. The unfolding of the power of action coincides with thewithdrawal of self-awareness. At the higher level, the universal outpouringof consciousness is experienced as the inner Being of all things whichspontaneously rise out of it without obscuring it in any way pg 98</p>
    
    <p>The Doctrine of Vibration urges us to be conscious of Spanda, therecurrent activity of consciousness. In all its outer phases, be they will,knowledge or action, we can catch a glimpse of our authentic identity andrealise our inherent freedom. The inner activity of consciousness, free ofall restrictions, is bliss itself. The experience of Spanda is wonder, anabiding bliss far higher than the transitory pleasures of life. We canexperience Spanda through the activity of the senses, mind and body,because its foundation is universal consciousness, our authentic Sivanature. Thus the Spanda yogi finds freedom where those who, failing toattend to the vibration of consciousness, are bound pg 98</p>
    
    <p>the Doctrine of Vibration focuses onthe continuity and change which characterize every experience. pg 100</p>
    
    <p>The opposites separate and merge in rhythm with the pulsing union  of Siva and Sakti. This play of opposites is itself the absolute, the supreme  form of Spanda.7   When Siva and Sakti unite, the universe, formerly  experienced as a reality set apart from consciousness, ceases to exist.  When they separate, it is once more created. The eternal rhythm of cosmic  creation and destruction is consonant with the pulse of their union and  separation. Spanda is the blissful relationship between these two aspects  through which the universe unfolds pg 100</p>
    
    <p>In India, metaphysics serves as a theoretical framework supporting  a body of spiritual discipline; it is never merely abstract speculation.  More than a reasoned opinion, it indicates the seeker's attitude to  his own experience, an attitude that forms the path he treads to salvation.  When the seeker acts upon the conclusions he has reached, philosophy  blends imperceptibly into religion. To the degree in which he participates  in this new attitude, death yields to immortality and the darkness of  doubt and ignorance is banished by the light of spiritual illumination.  Underpinning the quest is the ultimate goal: gnosis, which is not a  knowledge of things but insight into their essential nature. Metaphysical  insight is the pinnacle of knowledge. Long ago those who attained this  absolute knowledge exclaimed: "no longer can anyone bring before  us anything that we have not already found understood or known."1  It is essentially a state or experience of recognition.  The ways to this realisation are various. We can tread the Path of  Wisdom (jnanamarga) and seek to intuit the Real, illumined by its  own brilliance, in the directness of (an essentially mystical) insight  developed through meditative practice and disciplined reasoning  (viveka). Another way is that of Devotion {bhaktimarga) to the  embodiment of truth experienced with religious awe and wonder as  Deity. A third way is to follow the Path of Yoga and seek freedom  directly through mastery {aisvarya) of the Self and with it the All  which it contains and governs pg 33</p>
    
    <p>As Karl Potter remarks:  The ultimate value recognised by classical Hinduism in its most  sophisticated sources is not morality but freedom, not rational self-  control in the interests of the community's welfare but complete control  over one's environment—something which includes self-control but  also involves control of others and even control of the physical sources  of power in the universe.2  Freedom (svatantrya) in the sense of both autonomy (kaivalya)  and mastery (aisvarya) is the goal. It can be attained only if we manage  to rid ourselves of outer constraints and limitations. To do this we  must be able to homologise with a single, all-embracing reality from  which nothing is excluded—neither the world nor ourselves. Th,e  dualism of most devotional approaches, however tempered, understands  reality in terms which preclude the possibility of ultimate release. If  we are to attain salvation, reality can only be one and absolute. In the  Hindu tradition the nature of this absolute has been understood in a  wide variety of ways. Here we shall consider only two. One is embodied  in the metaphysics of Kashmiri Saivism and the other in that of Advaita  Vedanta.  Advaita Vedanta emerged, to a large extent, as a critique of  Samkhya dualism. Classical Samkhya posits two realities, both eternal  but of contrary nature. One is Puru?a, 'the Person1  , the other Prakrti  or 'Nature'. The Person is the Self who, as pure sentient consciousness,  is the witness of the activity of all that lies in the sphere of objectivity.  The latter includes not only the outer physical world but also the body  and mind the Person inhabits, vitalising and illumining it with his  conscious presence. Although varied and constantly changing, all  that lies in the sphere of objectivity shares a common nature. All  thoughts, perceptions or physical phenomena are equally part of the  play of Nature—Prakrti—which manifests in this way to fulfil the need  of the Person for phenomenal experience. pg 34</p>
    
    <p>Isvarakrsna explains:  Just as a dancing girl retires from her dance after performing for  the audience, in the same way Nature (Prakrti) retires after exhibiting  herself to the Person.4  In this way the Person achieves a state of transcendental detachment  (kaivalya). But because the Person is an independent reality, already  separate from Nature, he can in fact neither be bound nor released.  Therefore, no one is actually bound, no one released and no one  transmigrates. [It is] Nature, the abode of diversity that transmigrates,  is bound and released.5  Ultimately, bondage is unreal and no relationship is possible  between an eternal subject and an equally eternal object. The problem  is that they cannot be related to one another unless this relationship  is also eternal. In order to preserve the transcendental integrity of the  Person, the reality of Nature must be denied. Not only does the Advaita  Vedanta do this, but it also denies that there is a plurality of Persons.  The Self, each individual's most authentic identity, is beyond the  specifications of the qualities of Nature, and so nothing can distinguish  one 'self from another. The Self is one only and hence none other than  the Brahman, the absolute, free of all specification. From this point of  view the one reality can only be grasped through negation.6   However,  although this safeguards it from predication it also implies that the  empirical (vyavahara) is itself a negation of absolute reality. As Ksemaraja  puts it: "the Brahman is what the world is not."7   And so the world  is less than real. The Brahman is always empirically unmanifest  (avyakta).* It is beyond the reach of the senses but, like the Person,  is the witness (sdksin) of all things. It can never be an object of knowledge  for "who can know the knower?"9   Ultimately it is that which cannot  be grasped or perceived. The world which is 'grasped1   and 'perceived'  cannot be the Brahman and is consequently less than real. pg 35</p>
    
    <p>The Vedantin seeks to preserve the integrity of the absolute by  safeguarding it from all possible predication. The Saiva24   defends the  absolute status of the absolute by ensuring that it is in every way self-  subsistent (svatantra) and all-embracing (puma). The integral nature  of the absolute allows for the existence of the world of objectively  perceivable phenomena along with the pure subjectivity of consciousness.  The two represent opposite polarities of a single reality. Of these two,  objectivity is insignificant (tuccha) with respect to the ultimacy  (paramarthatva) of the subject.25   It is the sphere of negation, in which  objectivity presents itself as a void (sunya) in relation to the fullness  of the subject.26   Thus it appears in some Kashmiri Saiva works that  objectivity is said to be false with respect to the ultimate reality of  absolute consciousness.27   What is meant, however, is that nothing  can exist apart from the absolute; not merely in the sense that only the  absolute exists, but also that nothing exists separated from it. All  things are as if nothing in themselves apart from the absolute in this  sense alone—it does not mean that they do not exist.28   The world, in  other words, represents a level of manifestation within the absolute  which in the process of its emanation must, at a certain stage, radically  contrast one aspect of its nature with another to appear as the duality  and multiplicity of manifestation.29   The One is not any one thing because  it is all things;30   excluding nothing from its omniformity, it cannot be  defined in any other way than as the Supremely Real (paramartha). pg 38</p>
    
    <p>The Real is, from this point of view, the All (nikhila). It is the pure  absolute because nothing stands outside it which can in any way qualify  its absoluteness; on this point at least, Saiva and Vedantin are in  agreement. It is the Saiva's approach to establishing the absoluteness  of the absolute which differs from the Vedanta. The Saiva method is  one of an ever widening inclusion of phenomena mistakenly thought  to be outside the absolute. The Vedantin, on the other hand, seeks to  understand the nature of the absolute by excluding (nisedhd) every  element of experience which does not conform to the criterion of  absoluteness, until all that remains is the unqualified Brahman. The  Saiva's approach is one of affirmation and the Vedantin's one of negation.  They arrive at the absolute from opposite directions. pg 38</p>
    
    <p>The New Way (navamarga)33 taught in Kashmiri Saiva doctrine  is transcendence through active participation. Not freedom 'from',  but freedom 'to'. Desire is not denied, but accepted at a higher level  as the pure will or freedom (svdtantrya) of the absolute. Desire is to be  eliminated only if it is desire 'for' (akariksa), rather than desire 'to' (icchd).  Matter cannot sully the absolute, nor is it unreal. Freedom is achieved  by knowing 'matter-unreality' completely pg 39</p>
    
    <p>From this point of view ignorance  is failure to experience directly the intimate connection (sambandha)  between the infinite and the finite, thus justifying an active participation  in the infinite-finite continuum. Following this New Way the transition  from the finite to the infinite does not require that we postulate any  ontological distinction between them. The finite is a symbol of the  infinite. The infinite stamps its seal (mudra) onto its own nature replete  with all possible forms of the finite.34   This is the transcendental attitude  of the absolute, namely its impending manifestation as the finite. Reality  is the state of eternal emergence {satatodita) of the finite from the  infinite and vice versa. Expansion of the relative distinction (bheda)  between the elements constituting the All is equivalent to contraction  of the undivided (abheda) awareness of its totality and vice versa.  Neither excludes the other, but together they participate in the all-  embracing fullness (purnata) of the pulsation (spanda) of the absolute  in its different phases of being. True knowledge (sadvidya) from this  point of view, is to know that the apparent opposites normally contrasted  with one another, such as subject and object, unity and diversity, absolute  and relative, are aspects of the one reality. pg 40</p>
    
    <p>The absolute yearns for nothing other  than itself. Desire is not to be abandoned but elevated to the level of  this pure will (icchdmdtra). This is achieved not by restraint or suppression  of desire, but by merging it with the divine creative will of the absolute. pg 41</p>
    
    <p>The absolute oscillates between a 'passion' (rdgd) to create and  'dispassion' (virago) from the created. This is the eternal pulsation—  Spanda—of the absolute. Through it the absolute transforms itself  into all things and then returns back into the emptiness (sunya) of its  undifferentiated nature. Both poles of this movement are equally real;  both are equally absolute. Allowing for the reality of manifestation,  the Saiva absolute is called the Great Oneness (mahddvaya).43 An  experienced music lover, hearing a fast sequence of notes played on  the vind can distinguish whether the microtones are high or low.44  Similarly the well-practiced yogi can discern the unity of reality while  phenomena are manifest to him. If duality and unity were in fact  absolute contraries, the moment they appeared together, they would  cancel each other out. This, however, is not the case. We continue to  experience the diversity of daily life (yyavahdra)45 pg 41</p>
    
    <p>Reality is the One (eka) which becomes manifest as the many (bahu).  Universal Being moves between two poles, viz., diversification of the  one and unification of the many. Thought (vikalpa) interferes with  our direct intuitive understanding of this fact and splits up the two  aspects of this movement into separate categories. Reality is a structured  whole consisting of a graded hierarchy (taratamya) of metaphysical  principles corresponding to the planes of existence (dasa). On the lowest  planes up to the level of Maya, we experience division (bheda) between  objects and ourselves; at the highest level we reach the plane of unity  (abheda) which pervades and contains within itself all the others. pg 42</p>
    
    <p>Abhinava explains that the  exponents of different systems are like blind men who, presented with  an elephant, touch one part or another and argue amongst themselves  about what it could be. This is not because they disagree completely  but because their agreement is only partial.55   Ultimately, differing  views of reality are the result of the capacity (sakti) of the absolute to  appear in different forms.56   Rather than reject all views as incorrect  because they are not completely true, the Kashmiri Saiva prefers to  accept them all because they are partially true.  pg 43</p>
    
    <p>Saivism equates the absolute wholly  with consciousness. Reality is pure consciousness alone (samvid).  Consciousness and Being are synonymous.58   To experience the essential  identity between them is to enjoy the bliss (ananda) of realisation pg 43</p>
    
    <p>The concept of consciousness is the firm foundation upon which  Kashmiri Saiva metaphysics is constructed. One could almost describe  it as a psychology of absolute consciousness. Consciousness is more than  the awareness an individual has of himself and his environment; it is  an eternal all-pervasive principle. It is the highest reality (paramartha)  and all things are a manifestation of this consciousness (cidvyakti).61  All entities, without distinction, are of the nature of consciousness02  and hence reality can be positively affirmed to be a 'compact mass of  consciousness and b\\ss\ (ciclanandaghana). There are no holes or gaps  anywhere in reality where consciousness is absent. It is eternally and  blissfully at rest within its own nature (svatmavisranta), free of all  association with anything outside itself.63   Free of all craving for  anything (nirakanksd) and independent (nirapeksa), it looks to none  other but itself (ananyamukhapreksin).  The essential nature (svabhava) of this pure universal consciousness  is the true nature of the Self. As the supreme subject who illumines and  knows all things, it is called the 'Great Light1   {mahaprakasa) which is  uncreated and can never be taught (asrauta). Figuratively described as  the sun of consciousness, its light absorbs duality in its brilliance,  bathing the whole universe with the splendour of its divine radiance.  Making all things one with its nature, it transforms them into the sacred  circle (mandala) of its own rays.64   Not only is consciousness absolute,  it is also divine. It is Siva, the Lord (cinnatha) of the universe.65   As the  authentic identity (atman) of all living beings, consciousness is the  supreme object of worship, the true nature of Deity.66 pg 44</p>
    
    <p>Consciousness is not a passive witness (saksiri), but is full of the  conscious activity (citikriya) through which it generates the universe68  and reabsorbs it into itself at the end of each cycle of creation. The  freedom (svdtantrya) of consciousness to do this is its sovereign power  (aisvarya) by virtue of which it is the one God Who governs the entire  universe. pg 45</p>
    
    <p>Both dynamic and creative, this divine power is Spanda—the  vibration of consciousness. Its universal activity is the basis of Siva's  divine sovereign status. Indeed, Spanda is Siva's most essential nature  for without it He would not be God. pg 45</p>
    
    <p>Kashmiri Saivism, on the contrary, believes in a personal absolute  God Who is the one reality (isvaradvayavada). The planes within the  absolute correspond to a hierarchy of deities which rule over them,  empowered to do so by the Supreme Deity: consciousness. Absolute  Deity is the highest level of consciousness which stands at the supreme  summit of Being (parakas(ha). It is attained by a process of ascent  through higher levels or, in other words, through increasingly expanded  states of consciousness, until we reach the highest and most complete  state of expansion possible (pumavikasa). The Supreme Lord rests  at the end of the expansion or evolution of objectivity from the lowest  level to the supramental state (unmana) of pure consciousness pg 46</p>
    
    <p>Interiority {antaratva) is the keynote of both Kashmiri Saiva  metaphysics and practice: it is a 'doctrine which maintains that everything  is internal' {antararthavada).15 Everything, according to this view,  resides within one absolute consciousness. It is the great abode of the  universe.76   Full (puma) of all things, it sustains them all and embraces  them within its infinite, all-pervasive nature pg 46</p>
    
    <p>As Jayaratha says:  Just as images manifest in a mirror, for example, are essentially  mere appearances, so too are [phenomena] manifest within conscious-  ness. Thus, beause they are external, [phenomena] have no being (sattva)  of their own. The Lord says this [not with the intention of saying  anything about the nature of things] but in order to raise the level of  consciousness of those people who are attached to outer things; thus  everything in this sense is essentially a mere appearance. [Knowing this],  in order to quell the delusion of duality, one should not be attached to  anything external.79 pg 47</p>
    
    <p>The Saivite idealist.  however, says that the object is a form of awareness (vijnanakara)**  The objective status of the object is cognition itself.89   Perception  manifests its object and renders it immediately apparent (sphuta) to those  who perceive it.90   It does not appear at any other time.91 pg 48</p>
    
    <p>Adopting the Buddhist Yogacara  doctrine that things necessarily perceived together are the same (sahopa-  lambhaniyamavada), the Saivite affirms that because the perceived is  never found apart from perception, they are in fact identical.96   Reality  (satya) is the point where the intelligible and the sensible meet in the  common unity of being; it cannot be said to exist in itself outside, and apart  from, knowledge or vision. pg 49</p>
    
    <p>Consciousness is essentially active. Full of the vibration of its own  energy engaged in the act of perception, it manifests itself externally  as its own object. When the act of perception is over, consciousness  reabsorbs the object and turns in on itself to resume its undifferentiated  inner nature.98 pg 49</p>
    
    <p>Even stones bear  a trace (vasana) of consciousness, although it is not clearly apparent  because it is not associated with the vital breath (prana) and other  components of a psycho-physical organism.104   Somananda goes so  far as to affirm that physical objects, far from being insentient, can  only exist insofar as they are aware of themselves as existing. pg 50</p>
    
    <p>Mahesvarananda writes:  The Supreme Lord's unique state of emotivity (asadharanabhava)  is the outpouring of pure Being (mahdsatta). It is manifest as the  brilliance (sphuratta) of the universe which, if we ponder deeply, [is  realized to be] the single flavour (ekarasa) of the essence of Beauty  which is the vibration of the bliss of one's own nature.114  In this way all things are in reality one although divided from the  one another sharing as they do the 'single flavour' (ekarasa) of the pure  vibration of consciousness. pg 51</p>
    
    <p>Kashmiri Saivism as a whole has been variously called a form of  'realistic idealism',115   'monistic idealism',116   'idealistic monism'117   and  'concrete monism' pg 51</p>
    
    <p>The nature of  the absolute, and also that of Being, is conceived as an eternal becoming  (satatodita), a dynamic flux or Spanda,119   'the agency of the act of  being'.120   It is identified with the concrete actuality of the fact of  appearing, not passive unmanifest Being. Appearance (dbhdsa) alone  is real.121   Appearing (prakdsamdnatva) is equivalent to the fact of being  (astitva).122  pg 52</p>
    
    <p>Liberating  knowledge is gained not by going beyond appearances but by attending  closely to them. pg 54</p>
    
    <p>All things are known to be just as they present themselves. The  concrete actuality of being known (pramiti), irrespective of content,  is itself the vibrant (spandd) actuality of the absolute. Liberating  knowledge is gained not by going beyond appearances but by attending  closely to them. "The secret," Mahesvarananda says, "is that liberation  while alive (jlvanmukti) is the profound contemplation of Maya's  nature."136 pg 54</p>
    
    <p>The yogi experiences every  individual particular as the sum total of everything else. He recognises  that all things have one nature and that every particular is all things.142  This is the 'essence' {sard) or co-extensive unity (samarasya) of all things. pg 54</p>
    
    <p>Daily  life proceeds on the basis of the operation and withdrawal of the conditions  necessary for fruitful action to be possible. Appearance in this sense  represents the actualisation of a potential hidden in consciousness made  possible by virtue of its dynamic, Spanda nature which is both the flow  from inner to outer and back as well as the power that impels it. The  emergence from, and submergence into, pure consciousness of each  individual appearance is a particular pulsation (visesaspanda) of  differentiated awareness. Together these individual pulsations constitute  the universal pulse (sdmdnyaspandd) of cosmic creation and destruction.  Thus, every single thing in this way forms a part of the radiant vibration  (sphurattd, sphurana) of the light of absolute consciousness pg 57</p>
