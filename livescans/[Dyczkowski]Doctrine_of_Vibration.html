    <p>the Spanda school takes its name from one of its root texts, namely, the Spandakarikd, the Stanzas on Vibration. pg20</p>
    
    <p>The philosophy of the Pratyabhijna focuses on the liberating recognition of the soul's authentic identity as Siva while the Doctrine of Vibration stresses instead the importance of experiencing Spanda, the vibration or pulse of consciousness. The mainstay of the Doctrine of Vibration is the contemplative experience the awakened yogi has of his true nature as the universal perceiving and acting consciousness. Every activity in the universe, as well as every perception, notion, sensation or emotion in the microcosm* ebbs and flows as part of the universal rhythm of the one reality, which is Siva, the one God Who is the pure conscious agent and perceiver. According to the Doctrine of Vibration, man can realise his true nature to be Siva by experiencing Spanda, the dynamic, recurrent and creative activity of the absolute. pg 20-21</p>
    
    <p>The Spanda school, like the Pratyabhijna, originated and developed in Kashmir through the works of known authors, not in anonymous Tantras. Indeed, the origins of this school mark the beginnings of Kashmiri Saivism in our modern sense of the term. pg21</p>
    
    <p>The motion of absolute consciousness is a creative movement, a transition from the uncreated state of Being to the created state of Becoming. In this sense Being is in a state of perpetual Becoming (satatodita); it constantly
phenomenalises into finite expression. The shining of inner Being is the
manifestation of outer Becoming and, as such, is the constantly self-renewing source of its own appearing as Becoming. pg77</p>
    
    <p>Every event is a part of the greater rhythm of the total, cosmic event. Every object is part of the universal object and every subject shares in the agency of the universal subject. pg80</p>
    
    <p>Kashmiri Saivism maintains that all things are spontaneously emanated by consciousness in such a way that the original source of the emitted product remains unchanged and one with its emanation. The plenitude of universal manifestation emerges out of the fullness of the absolute; both are perfect expressions of the all-encompassing totality of reality which, thus emitting itself, suffers no loss. pg87</p>
    
    <p>Prior to their manifestation, all things reside within consciousness ina potential form just as in a peacock's egg, we find all the peacock's limbswith its feathers large and small, colours and patterns.85 pg 92</p>
    
    <p>Siva, the universal agent, eternally active is never bound by Hisactivity. The universe is the unfolding effect of Siva's agency (kartfpratha)while He, as the agent, always remains true to His essential, autonomousnature.124 The law of action and reaction {karma) binds only theignorant.125 At the lower level, outer activity contrasts with innerawareness. The unfolding of the power of action coincides with thewithdrawal of self-awareness. At the higher level, the universal outpouringof consciousness is experienced as the inner Being of all things whichspontaneously rise out of it without obscuring it in any way pg 98</p>
    
    <p>The Doctrine of Vibration urges us to be conscious of Spanda, therecurrent activity of consciousness. In all its outer phases, be they will,knowledge or action, we can catch a glimpse of our authentic identity andrealise our inherent freedom. The inner activity of consciousness, free ofall restrictions, is bliss itself. The experience of Spanda is wonder, anabiding bliss far higher than the transitory pleasures of life. We canexperience Spanda through the activity of the senses, mind and body,because its foundation is universal consciousness, our authentic Sivanature. Thus the Spanda yogi finds freedom where those who, failing toattend to the vibration of consciousness, are bound pg 98</p>
