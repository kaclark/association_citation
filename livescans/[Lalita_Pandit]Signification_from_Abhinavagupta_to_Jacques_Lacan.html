    <p>The signifying value of that which stumbles in a spoken or written sentence refers to Lacan's idea of a split between the ego and the subject, a fundamental principle of post-structuralist psychoanalysis. Lacan's theory of mind and language is quite obviously anti-objectivist and it rejects psychologisms that reify the human being. The subject, for Lacan, is necessarilysubjective and the split between the subject and the ego is a contingency for the "full word." Lacan's emphasis on a subjectivist account of the unconscious is similar in many ways to the subjectivism of the pre-modernpsychology and linguistics that underliesdhvani theory. pg1</p>
    
    <p>the dhvani theorists and the practioners of Lacanian psychoanalysis emphasize the connection between language and unconscious desire. In analytic situations, ultimately, the subject is the subject of the unconscious and it speaks most "truthfully," as Freud has pointed out, in slips of the tongue and other errors showing that the ego's censorship has been suspended. pg1</p>
    
    <p>The unconscious for Lacan is not a reified object; instead, it is a discourse that proceeds as a result of the "split" and "cut" between the suject de enonciation (speaking subject) and the sujet de l'enonce (subject as spoken of): the constituting subject and the constituted subject. pg1</p>
    
    <p>In his widely known essay, "Function and Field of Speech and Language," Lacan makes an explicit reference to the Indian theory of sug gestion in order to point out that the unconscious does not express itself in language; it reveals itself through suggestion. More narrowly, Lacan traces the sources of the "full word" in what he calls "the power of the symbol," a power that the analyst can evoke "in a carefully calculated fashion in the semantic resonances of his remarks" (Ecrits 1966, 82). He adds, "this is sure ly the way for a return to the use of symbolic effects in a renewed technique of interpretation in analysis" [emphasis mine] (82). Thus, it is in the context of finding a more dynamic technique that Lacan refers to "the teaching of Abhinavagupta (tenth century)" (110). More specifically, Lacan identifies Abhinava's dhvani theory and the properties of speech on which the theory is based as an important source for his notion of the "full word". pg1</p>
    
    <p>The sequence of passages in which Lacan first refers to the dhvani theory are worth quoting in full. 

In this regard, we could take note of what the Hindu tradition teaches about dhvani, in the sense that this tradition stresses the property of speech by which it communicates what it does not actually say. Hindu tradition illus trates this by a tale whose ingenuousness, which appears to be the usual thing in these examples, shows itself humorous enough to induce us to pen etrate the truth that it conceals. A girl, it begins, is waiting for her lover on the bank of a stream when she sees a Brahmin coming along towards her. She runs to him and exclaims in the warmest and most amiable tones: 'What lucky day this is for you! The dog that used to frighten you by its barking will not be along this river bank again, for it has just been devoured by a lion that is often seen around here'.... The absence of the lion may thus have as much affect as his spring would have were he present, for the lion only springs once, says the proverb appreciated by Freud (Ecrits 82). pg1</p>
    
    <p>The example of the girl, the Brahmin, the devouring lion and the recalcitrant dog is one of nearly five hundred examples discussed at length in Dhvanydloka. pg1-2</p>
    
    <p>The "primary character of symbols," Lacan says, "brings them close to those numbers out of which others are composed, and if they therefore underlie all the semantemes [emphasis added] of a language (langue), we shall be able to restore to speech its full value of evocation [emphasis added] for their inferences, using as our guide a metaphor whose symbolic displacement will neutralize the secondary meanings of the terms that it associates" (82). The psychoanalytic significance of poetic metaphor is based on what Lacan calls a "profound assimilation of the resources of language (langue), and especially of those that are concretely realized in its poetic texts [emphasis added]" (82 83). From this citation and discussion, Ahbhinava's dhvani theory emerges as an important source for Lacan's idea of a new psychoanalytic technique of interpretation. pg2</p>
    
    <p>Abhinava's dhvani aesthetic is undoubtedly one of the most significant non-Western literary/poetic theories that developed in India for centuries before the beginning of Mid-Eastern and European colonialisms. pg2</p>
    
    <p>The world-historical Dasien, as Heidegger maintains, is "that living thing whose Being is essentially deter mined by the potentiality for discourse" (Being and Time 41). pg2</p>
