    <p>"Categorical logic, as its name indicates, is logic in the setting of category theory. But this description does not say much. Most readers would probably find more instructive to learn that categorical logic is algebraic logic, pure and simple. It is logic in an algebraic dressing. Just as algebraic logic encodes propositional logic in its different guises (classical, intuitionistic, etc.) by their LindenbaumTarski algebras (Boolean algebras, Heyting algebras and so on), categorical logic encodes first-order and higher-order logics (classical, intuitionistic, etc.) by categories with additional properties and structure (Boolean categories, Heyting categories and so on). Thus, from the purely technical point of view, categorical logic constitutes a generalization of the algebraic encoding of propositional logic to firstorder, higher-order and other logics. Furthermore, we shall present and discuss arguments (given by the main actors) to show that this encoding constitutes the correct generalization of the well-known algebraic encoding of propositional logics by the Lindenbaum-Tarski algebras." pg1</p>
    
    <p>Categorical logic is not merely a convenient tool or a powerful framework. Again, as is usually the case when algebraic techniques are imported and used in a field, the very nature of the field has to be thought over. Furthermore, various results shed a new light on what was assumed to be obvious or, what turns out to be often the same on careful analysis, totally obscure. Thus, categorical logic is philosophically relevant in more than one way. The way it encodes logical concepts and operations reveals important, even essential, aspects and properties of these concepts and operations. Again, as soon as quantifiers are seen as adjoint functors, the traditional question of the nature of variables in logic receives a satisfactory analysis. pg 1</p>
    
    <p>This paper covers the period that can be qualified as the birth and the constitution of categorical logic, that is the time span between 1963 and 1977. No one will deny that categorical logic started with Bill Lawvere’s Ph.D. thesis written in 1963 under S. Eilenberg’s supervision and widely circulated afterwards. (It is now available on-line on the TAC web-site.) In his thesis, Lawvere offered a categorical version of algebraic theories. He also suggested that the category of categories could be taken as a foundation for mathematics and that sets could be analyzed in a categorical manner. In the years that followed, Lawvere tried to extend his analysis and sketched a categorical version of first-order theories under the name of elementary theories. Then, in 1969, in collaboration with Myles Tierney, Lawvere introduced the notion of an elementary topos, making an explicit connection with higher-order logic and type theories. Both Lawvere and Tierney were aiming at an elementary, that is first-order, axiomatic presentation of what are now called Grothendieck toposes, a special type of categories introduced by Alexandre Grothendieck in the context of algebraic geometry and sheaf theory. Soon after, connections with intuitionistic analysis, recursive functions, completeness theorems for various logical systems, differential geometry, constructive mathematics were made. pg 2</p>
    
    <p>We will here only rehearse the ingredients required for the history of categorical logic. The reader is referred to [Landry and Marquis, 2005], [Marquis, 2006] and [Kr¨omer, 2007] for more details. Category theory made its official public appearance in 1945 in the paper entitled “General Theory of Natural Equivalences” written by Samuel Eilenberg and Saunders Mac Lane. This “off beat” and “far out” paper, as Mac Lane came to qualify it later [Mac Lane, 2002, 130], was meant to provide an autonomous framework for the concept of natural transformation, a concept whose generality, pervasiveness and usefulness had become clear to both of them during their collaboration on the clarification of an unsuspected link between group extensions and homology groups. Such a general, pervasive and conceptually useful notion seemed to deserve a precise, rigorous, systematic and abstract treatment. Eilenberg and Mac Lane decided to devise an axiomatic framework in which the notion of natural transformation would receive an entirely general and autonomous definition. This is where categories came in. Informally, a natural transformation is a family of maps that provides a systematic “translation” or a “deformation” between two systems of interrelated entities within a given framework. But in order to give a precise definition of natural transformations, one needs to clarify the systematic nature of these deformations, that is, one has to specify what these deformations depend upon and how they depend upon it. Eilenberg and Mac Lane introduced what they called functors — the term was borrowed from Carnap — so that one could say between what the natural transformations were acting: a natural transformation is a family of maps between functors. Clearly, one has to define the notion of a functor: the concept of category was tailored for that purpose. The systematic nature of natural transformations was also made clear by categories themselves. Thus categories were introduced in 1945 and, as Mac Lane reported (see [Mac Lane, 2002]), Eilenberg believed that their paper would be the only paper written on “pure” category theory pg 3</p>
    
    <p>As we have already mentioned, Eilenberg and Mac Lane gave a purely axiomatic definition of category in their original paper. It is worth mentioning that they explicitly avoided using a set-theoretical terminology and notation in the axioms themselves. Here is how their definition unfolds (only with a slightly different notation): A category C is an aggregate of abstract elements X, called the objects of the category, and abstract elements f, called mappings of the category. pg 4</p>
