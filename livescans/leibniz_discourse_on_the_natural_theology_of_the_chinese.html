    <p>"A fortiori, concerning the Chinese, where the Monarch, who is the leader of all sages and the living embodiment of the law, appears to reveal national expressions of ancient doctrines" pg 53</p>
    
    <p>the Ming Dynasty was running the show when Leibniz was thinking about China: this motivates me to at least read the Wikipedia page on the Manchu and Ming Dynasties. Also the Emperor that Leibniz describes here is reported to have ruled for 61 years. Note for pg53 footnote 1</p>
    
    <p>Leibniz declares: "Father Ricci, founder of the mission to China" --> Need to look into him</p>
    
    <p>Regime Change in China greatly benefited the goals of the Jesuits in China

"the Mandarins did not take such ancient writings seriously (something which made for considerable difficulty in Ricci's time), are no longer valid today by authority of this prince and many knowledgeable members of his court. One should therefore profit from so great an authority." pg54</p>
    
    <p>Leibniz knows much about the history of Jesuit Missionary Activity in China and the surrounding Dramas. Note for page 54</p>
    
    <p>Is Leibniz actually applying Aristotle's Category of Substance to Angels and then asking if the Chinese can interpret this through existing practices?? Note for page 54</p>
    
    <p>Ok so apparently Angels are how Leibniz thinks Christian Doctrine can infiltrate Chinese Culture. He's putting a lot of effort into imagining how Jesuit Missionaries can be successful at spreading Christianity.

"During the time of the Scholastics, one did not condemn those who believed, with Aristotle, that certain intelligences governed the celestial spheres. Those among the Chinese who believe that their ancestors and great heroes are among the Spirits, come rather close to the words of our Lord [Matt. 22:30] which suggest that the Blessed resemble the Angels of God. It is then important to consider that those who give bodies to the genii or Angels, like the ancient philosophers or early Fathers, do not thereby deny the existence of created spiritual substances, for they accord rational souls to these genii endowed with bodies, as also men have them, but souls more perfect because their bodies are also more perfect." pg58</p>
    
    <p>Usually Colonialism refuses to acknowledge the greatness of other cultures. Oddly enough with China for Leibniz, its greatness almost matches or surpasses that of Europe (with the exception of the Scriptures, for he still wants the Christian Mission to be successful). However we cannot applaud him for his respect because clearly he is trying to fit what he can understand of China into his preconceived Theological notions, much like the Franscians did with Holy Poverty towards some of those of Turtle Island

"China is a great Empire, no less in area than cultivated Europe, and indeed surpasses it in population and orderly government. Moreover, there is in China in certain regards an admirable public morality conjoined to a philosophical doctrine, or rather doctrine of natural theology, venerable by its antiquity, established and authorized for about 3000 years, long before the philosophy of the Greeks whose works nevertheless are the earliest which the rest of the world possess, except for our Sacred Writings." pg59</p>
    
    <p>paraphrase, pg58: it would be barbaric of us to throw away ancient Chinese doctrine just because we can't recognize it with Scholastic Philosophy</p>
    
    <p>Aristotelianism and the I Ching; probably an interesting mix of themes

Footnote 12: "This reference to a 3000-year old doctrine of natural theology, coupled with Leibniz's high admiration for the trigrams of the I Ching, suggest that it is probably this classical text to which he is alluding." pg 59</p>
    
    <p>Leibniz pulls ideas from the unpublished works of high ranking Jesuit Missionaries!!

"it would even be desirable that all the classics be translated together. But this not yet being done, one can only make provisional judgments. Father Longobardi, S.J., Director of the Mission of China -- following Father Ricci (who was the first to go there) -- lived in China a great many years until his death (being nearly 90 years of age), and he recorded, in an incompletely published work, many passages of classical Chinese authors, but with the intent of refuting them. Since this makes those passages much less suspect of having been embroidered by him, I believe that what I might extract from them in order to give a reasonable meaning to the authoritative dogmas of China would be more reliable, and less subject to the suspicion of flattery. In addition, I will appeal here and there to what Father Antoine de Sainte-Marie, of the same opinion as Father Longobardi, has added to them." pg60</p>
    
    <p>This is just Leibniz doing Aristotle's Categories on supposed Chinese Doctrines...

"The first principle of the Chinese is called Li (2: 13), that is Reason, or the foundation of all nature (5: 32), the most universal reason and substance (11 : 50); there is nothing greater nor better than the Li (11: 53). This great and universal cause is pure, motionless, rarefied, without body or shape, and can be comprehended only through the understanding.

From the Li qua Li emanate five virtues: piety, justice, religion, prudence and faith (11:49)." pg60-61</p>
