    <p>Preface Hippocrates’ Aphorisms enjoyed great popularity in the ancient and medieval world. According to Maimonides, it was Hippocrates’ most useful work as it contains aphorisms, which every physician should know by heart. He adds that he even saw how non-physicians have schoolchildren memorize them in school, so that subsequently people who are not physicians know many of these aphorisms by heart from learning them in school. The Aphorisms were very popular in Jewish circles as well. They were translated into Hebrew sev- eral times, pg v</p>
    
    <p>it was Maimonides’ commentary on Hippocrates’ Aphorisms that was primarily responsible for the profound influence that the work had in Jew- ish circles. pg v</p>
    
    <p>Introduction 1 Biography Moses Maimonides, known by his Arab name, Abū ʿImrān Mūsā ibn ʿUbayd Allāh ibn Maymūn, and his Jewish name, Moshe ben Maimon, was not only one of the greatest Jewish philosophers and experts in Jewish law (halakhah),1 but an eminent physician as well. Born in Córdoba in 1138,2 he was forced to leave his native city at age thirteen because of persecutions by the fanatical Muslim regime known as the Almohads and the policy of religious intolerance adopted by them.3 After a sojourn of about twelve years in southern Spain, the family moved to Fez in the Maghreb. Some years later, probably around 1165, they moved again because of the persecutions of the Jews in the Maghreb, this time going to Palestine. After staying there for some months, the family moved on to Egypt and settled in Fusṭāṭ, the ancient part of Cairo. It was in Cairo that Maimonides started to practice and teach medicine, as well as pursue his commercial activities in the India trade.4 He became physi- cian to al-Qāḍī al-Fāḍil, the famous counsellor and secretary to Saladin. pg 1</p>
    
    <p>Medical Works Maimonides was a prolific author in the field of medicine, composing ten works considered as authentic.11 These ten works consist of the following major com- positions: 1. Sharḥ fuṣūl Abuqrāṭ (Commentary on Hippocrates’ Aphorisms); 2. K. al-sumūm wa-l-taḥarruz min al-adwiya al-qattāla (On Poisons and the Pro- tection against Lethal Drugs); 3. Fuṣūl Mūsā fī l-ṭibb (Medical Aphorisms); 4. Mukhtaṣarāt li-kutub Jālīnūs (Epitomes from the Works of Galen). The following treatises are considered minor works: 1. K. fī l-jimāʿ (On Coitus) probably written in 1190 or 1191 at the request of an anonymous high ranking client; 2. Fī tadbīr al-ṣiḥḥa (On the Regimen of Health), written at the request of al-Malik al-Afḍal; 3. Maqāla fī bayān baʿḍ al-aʿrāḍ wa-l-jawāb ʿanhā (On the Elucidation of Some Symptoms and the Response to Them), written for the same al-Malik al-Afḍal, when his condition did not improve; 4. Sharḥ asmāʾ al-ʿuqqār (Commentary pg 2</p>
    
    <p>on the Names of Drugs); 5. Risāla fī l-bawāsīr (On Hemorrhoids); 6. Maqāla fī l-rabw (On Asthma). In addition to these ten works featuring in the current bio- bibliographical literature, Maimonides is the author of the K. Qawānīn al-juzʾ al-ʿamalī min ṣināʿa al-ṭibb (On Rules Regarding the Practical Part of the Medical Art). pg 3</p>
    
    <p>Ḥunayn remarks, if I understand his words correctly, that he first translated Galen’s commentary and then added this translation to that of the Hippocratic Aphorisms themselves.19 Following the revised Syr- iac version, he prepared an Arabic translation in two phases, a first part at the request of Abū l-Ḥassan Aḥmad ibn al-Mudabbir (d. 883 or 884), who was a high official, courtier, and man of letters in Bagdad, Damascus, and Fusṭāṭ.20 As for Arabic translations of the Aphorisms themselves, we know about at least two translations, one from the hand of Ḥunayn and another earlier one from an anonymous source.21 On occasion, Ḥunayn’s translation of the Aphorisms deviates from the Greek text as it has come down to us.22 Since Maimonides consulted the Arabic trans- lation of the Aphorisms by Ḥunayn, such deviations recur in his commentary. pg 4</p>
    
    <p>Popularity of Hippocrates’ Aphorisms35 The didactic features of Hippocrates’ Aphorisms mentioned above were an important factor in making them extremely popular, as is borne out by numer- ous quotations and commentaries. Already in early antiquity, the work was commented upon, for instance, by Rufus of Ephesus, whose commentary has been lost. In late antiquity, Stephen of Alexandria and Palladius36 composed commentaries that are still extant today. Subsequently, numerous Arab physi- cians commented upon the Aphorisms, generally consulting the translation by Ḥunayn ibn Isḥāq of the lemmata featuring in the commentary by Galen of Pergamum.37 The Aphorisms occupied a prominent position in the Hebrew medical tradi- tion as well. On the evidence of the extant manuscript material, the work was translated into Hebrew no less than eleven times, whether as an independent text or as part of a later commentary. pg 8</p>
    
    <p>now maimon begins speaking pg -1</p>
    
    <p>In the name of God, the Merciful, the Compassionate [1] Says the master, the erudite, the eminent, the leader, Mūsā ibn ʿUbayd Allāh, the Israelite from Cordova, may God bless his soul: I do not think that any scholar who composes books would write a book in any kind of science with the intention that the contents of his book cannot be understood, unless they are explained. If any author would have such an intention, he would thwart the purpose of his composition, because an author does not write a book so that he alone will understand its contents. However, he writes a book so that others will understand it. And if a book he wrote can only be understood by another book he has thwarted the purpose of its composition. pg 28</p>
    
    <p>[2] In my view, there are four reasons why later [authors] were prompted to explain the books of earlier [authors] and to comment upon them: The first reason is the perfection of the degree [of knowledge] of the author. Because of his excellent intellect, he speaks briefly about things that are obscure, hidden, and difficult to understand [for others], but which are clear to him [so that] he does not need to use more words. If someone in a later gen- eration wants to understand those matters that were [written down] in such a concise way, it is very difficult for him. A commentator must add an explana- tion to his words so that the meaning of the matters, which the first author had in mind, can be understood. pg 28</p>
    
    <p>[3] The second reason is the omission of premisses in a book. For the author sometimes composes a book assuming that the reader will have preliminary knowledge of certain premisses. But if someone who does not know those premisses wants to understand that book, he is unable to do so. Then the com- mentator has to supply and explain those premisses, or to refer [the reader] to books in which those premisses are explained and to direct [him] to them. For the same reason the commentator has to explain the causes of things that were not mentioned by the author. pg 28</p>
    
    <p>[4] The third reason is the [correct interpretation] of a statement. For most statements in any language can be interpreted [in various ways]. They can have meanings that are different and sometimes even opposite or contradictory. Consequently, disagreement arises between those who look at that statement. One person gives it a certain interpretation and says that the author only meant this and another person gives it another interpretation. The commentator of that statement must declare one interpretation for correct and adduce proof for its correctness and declare the other interpretations for false. pg 30</p>
    
    <p>[5] The fourth reason is the errors that befall the author, or words that are repetitive or [even] utterly useless. The commentator must draw [the reader’s] attention to these words and prove that they are futile, useless, or repetitive. This should not really be called a commentary, but a refutation or annota- tion. However, when people study a book and most of its contents is correct, they usually consider the annotations to the few [erroneous] places to be part of the commentary, [in which] it is said: “the error of the author is such and such and the truth is such and such,” or: “this should not have been men- tioned,” or: “this is repetitious,” all this is explained. However, if the contents of that book are mostly mistaken, then the later work, which exposes those mistakes is called a refutation, not a commentary. When the work with the refutation cites a correct statement, it will say: “such and such statement is cor- rect.” pg 30</p>
    
    <p>[6] It seems to me that all the commentaries on the books of Aristotle were composed for the first and the third reason. All the commentaries on the books on the mathematical sciences were composed for the second reason, although it is also possible that some mathematical statements have been commented upon because of the fourth reason. For the book [called] Almagest,1 in spite of the eminence of its author, has errors that were pointed out by a group of Andalusian authors in the books they composed regarding that matter.2 1 For the Almagest, the famous astronomical handbook composed by Claudius Ptolemaeus from Alexandria and its medieval translations, see art. “Baṭlamiyūs,” in E.I.2, vol. 1, pp. 1100– 1102 (Plessner). 2 The conflict over Ptolemaic astronomy and Aristotelean cosmology that arose in twelfth cen- tury Spain was about the fact that Ptolemaic astronomy posits epicycles and eccentrics that enable the astronomer to make precise predictions of planetary motions, while Aristotelian cosmology requires all heavenly motion to be uniform, circular, and about the center of the earth. Some of Maimonides’ near-contemporaries rejected Ptolemaic astronomy and some tried to construct alternative theories. Maimonides himself exploited, as Stern, “Maimonides’ pg 30</p>
    
    <p>And all the commentaries written on the books by Hippocrates are mostly com- posed for the first, third, and fourth reason, while some of its statements are commented upon for the second reason. pg 32</p>
    
    <p>[7] However, Galen denies this and does not think in any way that the works of Hippocrates contain errors.3 But he (i.e., Galen) offers explanations, which cannot be supported by the text and provides commentaries to [certain] state- ments that are not alluded to by those statements. We can see how he did so in his commentary on the book On Humors,4 even though he was doubt- ful whether this book was written by Hippocrates or by someone else. He was prompted to do so because of the confusion in matters [discussed by him] and because it resembles the works of the alchemists or is [even] worse than these.5 In my opinion, it would be more correct to call it “The Book of [Mental] Con- fusion.”6 However, because of the fame of Hippocrates and the ascription of the book to him, he (i.e., Galen) composed this strange commentary. pg 32</p>
    
    <p>Some authors strive for brevity, which does not affect the meaning so that if, for example, to fulfill the purpose of the com- position in one hundred words they would not use one hundred and one words. Other [authors] aim at long-windedness and verbosity at composing a volu- minous work of many parts, even though the total work does not have much content. The same applies to commentators: Some of them explain something that needs to be explained as briefly as possible, and omit the rest; others are long-winded and explain that which does not need to be explained or explain that which needs to be explained more verbosely than necessary. pg 36</p>
    
    <p>[10] I thought that Galen is a very verbose commentator, as most of his [com- mentaries are very lengthy] until I noticed that he remarks in the beginning of his commentary on Plato’s Laws,12 and these are his words: “I have noticed that a commentator explained the following statement of Hippocrates on more than one hundred folios without any reason [to do so] and without [any actual] content: ‘When the disease reaches its climax, then the regimen [of the patient] should be extremely thinning.’”13 pg 36</p>
