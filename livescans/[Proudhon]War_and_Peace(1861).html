    <p>Introduction On the second of September 1861, just five months after publication in Brussels and then Paris, War and Peace was reviewed very favourably in the New York Times. “M. PROUDHON”, the reviewer wrote, “has just published a new work, marked by that extraordinary mingling of profundity and paradox which characterizes all the productions of his mind”. It is a work from an “incomparable logician, one of the most vigorous thinkers of the age”, marked by a “deep love of humanity” and shaped by “bold truths and equally bold fictions, paradoxes, vagaries and extravagances that seethe as in a cauldron through his pages”.1 But it was not so well received in France. “On ne me comprends pas” Proudhon lamented.2 “My friends don’t understand me […] while my enemies celebrate”.3 His republican critics satirised him: here was the man who championed death to private property and the state, now also proclaiming the historic significance and virtues of the martial impulse, the centrality of the right of force to politics and society, and the enduring virtues of the Austro-Hungarian Empire and the 1815 Vienna Treaties to the revolutionary cause. His friend, Jérôme-Amédée Langlois, told him he had to read the book twice before he understood it – no mean feat in less than a month.4 Part of the misunderstanding is surely down to Proudhon’s attempt to reach two very different audiences at once, and the relative absence of popular reflections on the rights of war and peace in literary circles at the time. On the one hand, his aim was make this a “classic”, a reflection on war and the philosophy of right that he hoped would be “destined to send everything published on the topic since Grotius and Vattel up to the attic”.5 But he also wanted it to have popular appeal, both educational and political. Unfortunately, in making concessions to both sides, Proudhon lost both audiences, and so, notwithstanding Leo Tolstoy’s appreciation for the book, it made no significant mark on public or academic debate for at least the next forty years. pg 1</p>
    
    <p>In what follows, I begin by offering a brief summary of Proudhon’s argument,7 and make the case that War and Peace as one of the first socialist expositions of the philosophy of war, history and right. It is this aspect of the text that I then trace through its subsequent intellectual history in the third part, tracing War and Peace through the works of Tolstoy, Georges Sorel and the twentieth century French sociology, including the work of Michel Foucault. pg 2</p>
    
    <p>the bulk of my introduction situates War and Peace in eighteenth and nineteenth century debates about the place of war in human (albeit largely European) history, in particular the writings of Immanuel Kant and Auguste Comte. I show how Proudhon charts a course between their writings, seeking a new balance between the individualist, transcendental idealism of Kant, and the collectivist, materialist, philosophical realism of Comte; between Kant’s account of the republican freedom, and Comte’s subsumption of the individual into the macro forces of history. pg 2</p>
    
    <p>Proudhon refutes what I call below the secular theodicy at the heart of Kant and Comte’s philosophies of history: the idea that good will always emerge out of evil, and that history has a transcendent telos, leading eventually to some sort of “perpetual peace”, or in Comte’s case, the transcendent unity of the human sciences and society in the age of positivism. Proudhon calls this hopeful account of history a philosophy of “providence”. For Kant and Comte the republican tradition, political constitutions would break the historic link between force and law, grounding right on reason. Proudhon disagreed. pg 3</p>
    
    <p>In brief, Proudhon argued that the history of war and violence are the domain of chance and brute force, and contrary to his interlocutors he also denied that force could be removed from politics. The right of force, a key concept in this work, is central to collective agency and it therefore underpinned the struggle for justice. Forces are ubiquitous in nature, and manifest in human society as social power (puissance) – the collective coordination of groups. The rights and force of individuals, groups and peoples are fired in the kiln of history, and war is the macro expression of this. Relations of (military, industrial or intellectual) force, latent in times of peace, sustain the rights of peoples, while in times of war they create new societies. Peace treaties, for example, are the constitutional shell which enable national systems of justice to develop. In this respect, Proudhon rejects the standard republican argument that force and law can be separated. Our systems of law and justice are founded on, sustained by, and dependent upon pacification, the latent relations of force and the threat of violence within society. In turn, the development of different societies can be attributed to war and its consequences, but that process has no inevitable outcome. This philosophy of history is one of “immanence”, rather than transcendence or theodicy. pg 3</p>
    
    <p>War, Proudhon argued, was caused by a “rupture in the economic equilibrium”, not by human nature or the will of gods. pg 4</p>
    
    <p>Proudhon argued that in providing a fuller understanding of war, the latent right of force in society could be “transformed” into more productive modes. But the unifying and militarising European nation states were determined to use conquest to resolve the problems of “pauperism”, a “rupture in the economic equilibrium” that pitched elites against one another and forced workers into penury. From the point of view of this socialist political economy, Proudhon was worried that Europe was approaching the nadir, not the apex of its history. The future of society depended on the reconstitution of society, through recognising the right of force immanent to the emerging labouring classes pg 4</p>
    
    <p>summary Proudhon seeks to answer a two-part question: what is war, and how are war and justice related? Previous answers conflated war with the will of god(s), or a manifestation of original sin. But none, he says, have studied how it is depicted in the historical oratory of the poets and the philosophers, and on the battle fields. We need to understand war in this dual aspect, its idealisation and its brute materiality, if we are to understand it at all, he argues. So what are Proudhon’s general arguments? In a letter to his friend Auguste Rolland, he summarised them: 1. War is a psychological fact, much more than a material one. If we want to understand anything about it, we must study how it manifests in human consciousness. 2. It is because the moral aspect of war has seemed in such contradistinction to the bloodletting, that the latter is conflated with its empirical aspect, and its true meaning remains a mystery. 3. This moral element, forgotten, misunderstood, and denied despite the evidence, is the RIGHT OF FORCE. 4. The laws of war are deduced from the competent and intelligent pursuit of the right of force. The Rights of Peoples rests upon these laws of war and form a juridical institution. 5. Unfortunately, these laws are routinely violated in practice, either due to the ignorance of the jurists or the passions of the Warrior, or due to the influence of the PRIMARY CAUSE of war, which is nothing other than pauperism and cupidity. 6. Can the violations of the laws of war be avoided? No, war cannot be reformed. 7. So, war must have some end other than its reform, and that is what I have tried to explain. If the nineteenth century is to avoid permanent moral decline, its mission must be the end of militarism. pg 9</p>
    
    <p>the laws of war are not derived from reason, or from the authority of states, but from the exercise of the right of force in practice: that is, they are immanent in the practice of war, there being no transcendent arbiter of these rules. pg 10</p>
    
    <p>Where the natural law and republican tradition argued that law begins where force ends, Proudhon argues that war and law are intricately connected pg 10</p>
    
    <p>Proudhon also rejected the pervasive nineteenth century call to violent revolution, fearing the cure would be worse than the malady. Rather, his aim here is the more modest one of asking us to see the moral and historical contingency at the heart of all our political institutions. All our institutions of law and justice rest on the outcome of war or the looming threat of violence. In the presence of endemic “pauperism” the absence of violence is due to the prevalence of modes of “pacification”.11 Only federation, and an aescetic philosophy, he argues, can resolve this. pg 11</p>
    
    <p>Pauperism is a concept Proudhon borrows from Malthus and the Malthusians and adapts to his own ends.12 Pauperism is a social condition endemic to those societies wherein consumption outstrips production, leading to economic crisis. In a twist on the Malthusian argument, Proudhon argues that when cities swell in size, and demand for food and luxury products outstrips the capacity to produce them; where landlordism or rent, monopoly, wage-labour and bourgeois gluttony and epicureanism, drains society, pauperism prevails. Pauperism is not directly related to population growth, but to the inability of society to properly organise to mitigate it. This imbalance between production and consumption in the context of population growth causes a “rupture in the economic equilibrium”.13 Communities can cope with relative poverty, but pauperism is a structural crisis that prompts societies to turn on themselves, precipitating what Proudhon calls the “social war”. Then, they turn outwards, first, towards plundering, and then, from the reign of Alexander the Great, to conquering peoples and territory for economic gain. In short, for all its appeal to glory, war is at root no more than the grubby attempt to mitigate pauperism and pacify the social war, caused by inequality and over-consumption, by robbing one’s neighbours. pg 11</p>
    
    <p>The evidence for these empirical claims about the psychological aspect of war, the right of force, pauperism and plunder, is ubiquitous, Proudhon argues. He finds it in the epics of ancient Greece, the legal scripture of the Roman Digest, the poems of Virgil, the myths of Titus Livy, and the injunctions of Cicero; the allegories and narratives of the Old and New Testament, the providentialist histories of European state formation, and the natural law tradition of the philosophy of right, that has both animated and followed these transformations in the use of force in modern European history. War saturates our conceptions of right, he argues. From the warring gods of the scriptures and epics, through to the writings of Hobbes, Vattel, Wolff, Pufendorf, and Kant (a group he labels les auteures, which we have translated as “the authors” or “the jurists”), the philosophy of right has co-evolved with the changing character of warfare. The novel doctrines of “utility” and “reason” pervades nineteenth century studies of the Napoleonic campaigns, for example in the writings of the Prussian diplomat and historian Friedrich Ancillon, the military strategist Baron Antoine-Henry Jomini, and Adolphe Thiers’s multi-volume History of the Consulate and the Empire of France under Napoleon (1799–1815), all of whom feature extensively in Proudhon's analysis. By historicising these debates, Proudhon shows us how the philosophy of right emerges in particular contexts and shapes both the conduct of war and its justification – and is shaped by war in turn.15 pg 12</p>
    
    <p>At the end of book one, Proudhon praises “the exile that brought me the inspiration for this book”.20 What did he mean by this? Napoleon III’s coup d’état in December 1851 had forced many of Proudhon’s socialist contemporaries to flee France for England. There they were confronted with the dark unfurling of modern industrial capitalism. pg 15</p>
    
    <p>Pierre-Joseph’s father was a cooper and taverner, who infamously refused, and failed to profit from his customers, and his mother was a cook and cleaner from a peasant family. These deprivations forced him to work for the family and made a timely, formal education impossible. Nevertheless, his intellect stood out, and his father urged him to take an apprenticeship as a proofreader and typesetter for a local press, which was highly skilled intellectual work at the time. Printing endless bibles, alongside the revolutionary works of his fellow Bisontin, Charles Fourier, was life-changing employment. In 1832, at the age of twenty three, Proudhon’s brother, Jean-Etienne, died in mysterious circumstances while serving in the French army. The event made Proudhon an “implacable enemy of the established order”.22 Five years later, Proudhon won a scholarship to study in Paris and turned his attention to the “social question”, a general European debate on the best way to organise society to the ends of equality and social justice. The standard French responses were framed in terms of the ‘utopian socialism’ of Saint-Simonian and republican thought, which was scientific, communalist and exceptionally technocratic, with institutonal architectures that were recognisably nationalist and statist. Proudhon’s first significant contribution to these debates was What is Property? An inquiry into the principle of right and of government (1840). In it, Proudhon famously argued that “property is theft!” and that government was a general “usurpation”. Against bourgeois natural law theories of property, he argued that private property was sustained by state force, and, by denying any democratic right for the workers to control the instruments of their own social reproduction (land, tools and education and labour), wage slavery was merely a “transformation” of chattel slavery. pg 16</p>
    
    <p>However, in the intervening years, Proudhon’s pen ranged far and wide. He extended his anarchist political philosophy into areas as mundane as the prize-winning Theory of Taxation (1861), as politically confrontational as General Idea of the Revolution in the Nineteenth Century (1851), and his seminal four-volume work De La Justice dans la Révolution et dans l’église (hereafter On Justice, 1858). But apart from a very general article on foreign affairs, published in Le Représentant du Peuple, on the 14th of May 1848,23 there is no direct discussion of international relations in his writings before 1861, and where it does arise it is fairly superficial. For example, in the final chapter of General Idea of the Revolution, Proudhon remarked that war was always likely for as long as the economic problems of the day remain unresolved and kings and politicians are unencumbered by the will of the people. This thesis – that international relations were epiphenomenal, emerging out of (and so solvable) by better domestic constitutions – was a standard republican trope well into the twentieth century.24 The revolutions of 1848 offered Proudhon a unique opportunity to try and put his anarchism into practice , and his failures shaped his theory of war and peace. He stood successfully as a Deputy in the 1848 Revolutionary assembly, but quickly realised that not even revolutionary states could affect the social reforms necessary to realising the sorts of freedoms he advocated. As he remarked in his election manifesto, “governmentality” socialises revolutionaries in the trappings of the state and bourgeoise politics and diverts them from the revolutionary cause. Seeing the corruption of the revolution everywhere, he quickly fell out with his fellow assembly members. pg 17</p>
    
    <p>One dispute was particularly portentous during this time in public office, and no doubt had a direct bearing on his understanding of war and peace: he was challenged to a duel. pg 17</p>
    
    <p>this first-hand experience of the duel is developed into a philosophy of history in War and Peace.26 Proudhon argues that the history of war has travelled in the opposite direction to that of the duel. Where duels have progressed from horseback jousting and proxies, to pistols at dawn, war has moved from the valour and virtue of hand-to-hand combat, to instrumental rationality and indiscriminate killing through the use of long-distance artillery. Military revolutions have denuded war of its moral element, while the invention of pistols heightened the moral integrity of the duel, Proudhon argues. pg 18</p>
    
    <p>Proudhon’s writings on war and peace should be read against the backdrop of the rise of positivist science and the dawn of the military-industrial age, what we today call the changing character of warfare.27 New ways of warfare were being developed, from iron hulled ships to advances in logistics and communications, and, of course standing national armies. The development of long-range artillery, defensive trenches and rapid fire, rifled machine guns, most notably in the Crimean War (1853–1856), precipitated the end of hand-to-hand combat and cavalry charges. These innovations also generated epochal arms races that continue to this day with international relations constituted as much by the nuclear balance of power as by the United Nations. pg 18</p>
    
    <p>Militarisme, as Proudhon defined it, also emerged at this time. The concept captures the conjoining of industry and the military by the state, the transformation of citizens into soldiers, and the administration of society through increasingly military means. Both at home and abroad, militarised colonial and class hierarchies were imposed on subject populations, making nationalities through the development of military techniques of cultural and political re-education.28 These military and social innovations were first tested in the colonies and then rolled out across the metropolitan centres. The world’s wealth, in particular slaves, was expropriated and shipped between the colonies and the European imperial metropoles, while subject populations were managed with ever more technocratic ferocity by states and private bodies, like the British and Dutch East India Companies. Industrial capitalism and enclosures began to generate an impoverished and landless proletariat in northern Europe, forcing peasants into fetid cities to work in factories or mines, or to rent a piece of land from the parasitic local lord, and pay him a share of the annual product. This expropriation was unsustainable. The aristocratic rulers of the European empires were beginning to crumble under the weight of these economic contradictions, with few able to keep pace with or harness for themselves the technological changes enriching the industrial bourgeoisie, who in turn financed the republican nationalists. The age-old marriage of state and church began to crumble as the old regime was unable to articulate an ideology that could counter the emerging doctrines of science and reason. But, the end of the old order and the rise of the techno-industrial age worried Proudhon that Europe was heading toward a redoubling of “the horrors of the iron age”.29 pg 19</p>
    
    <p>The contextual starting point is Proudhon’s four volume magnum opus, De la justice dans la révolution et dans l’église, published, in 1858. These four volumes, which won him his exile, are divided between twelve, études, or studies, ranging from “Work” to “Education”, “The State” to “Love and Marriage”. The scope of the work led Metternich to dub him the “illegitimate child of the Encyclopaedia”.31 What is most striking for our purposes is that eleven of the twelve books were extended by up to 100 pages each for the second edition, and only the ninth book, “Progress and Decline”, was left relatively untouched. This book was “one of the most difficult [to revise] because of the very nature of the question”, he remarked.32 Rather than tinker with it, he wrote War and Peace instead. In other words, War and Peace was intended as an extended case study of the philosophy of history and morality that was begun in De la Justice. A few more words about the philosophical structure of De la Justice are therefore in order. The central purpose of De la Justice was to replace a mainstream philosophy of “providence” with an anarchistic theory of “immanence”. Much modern philosophy was “providential”, Proudhon argued, with the telos of reason or of material history taking us to a transcendent utopia.33 The first task was to fathom this telos and all great thinkers thought they’d found the key in “reason”. The problem was how to convince anyone that a positive outcome could emerge from the demonstrable irrationalism of the times? How could anyone be convinced that a negative or “fallen” initial state (either capitalism, feudalism, religion, ignorance, etc) could issue anything better? How could a positive future be forged in the fires of iniquity? The answers to these sorts of questions were a type of secularised theodicy. Theodicy is that branch of theology that seeks to explain evil in relation to God’s omniscient plan: can good come out of evil and catastrophe?34 Writers from Adam Smith, to David Hume, Thomas Hobbes and Immanuel Kant, all argued that a “hidden hand” and its synonyms would guide society: if only men could reason and act according to transcendent or natural, rational first principles (happiness, self-preservation, and so on), the future was bright, they argued. “Providence”, then, was derived from the structures of reason itself, rather than from scripture, and once “right reason”, to use Hobbes’s term, had been divined, it would constitute the basis for a rational, practical politics, in harmony with this providential and pre-determined end point.35 As Proudhon recognised in a letter to Langlois, this was an epistemic exercise, with little or no relation to history or the real, phenomenal world around us.36 Proudhon’s theory of “immanence”, by contrast, was less theodicy than science and history, he argued. If we want to understand humans, we should study how ideas about good and evil are socially constituted, in and over time. There is no transcendent reason in history, Proudhon argued, only ideas that shape and guide people and actions in specific times and places. In this sense, the future is not determined or providential, it is “immanent”. History, Proudhon argued, is the story “of IMMANENCE, or of the innateness of Justice in the conscience”.37 What is rational is the emergent product of what feels right combined with what makes sense in any given situation. While we may all share basic moral impulses, context matters. What is right in one context may or may not be right in another: there is no a priori right. All of human history is a history of the unfurling of different conceptions of justice and right over time, fought for and established, acquiesced to and accepted, until some other conception emerges. He who speaks “as a partisan of immanence [is] a true anarchist”, he said.38 pg 21-22</p>
    
    <p>pg 23</p>
    
    <p>Proudhon’s debt to Comte, is as little known as Marx’s. pg 23</p>
    
    <p>Comte sent Proudhon complimentary copies of Système de Politique Positive (1854), with an odd invitation to join him in proselytising the positivist “Religion of Humanity”.44 Proudhon did not reply, but the impact of Comte’s relational, realist ontology is striking in War and Peace.45 pg 24</p>
    
    <p>Proudhon follows Comte in arguing that “Philosophy is all in the observation, internal and external: there is no exception to that rule”.46 Our ideas are real, relational and causal, and shaped by history and society. This was a fundamental departure from Kantian and neo-Hegelian rationalism, and an endorsement of Comtean sociology.47 Alongside a Comtian staged philosophy of history, Proudhon transforms Comte’s theory of “social facts” into his own theory of “collective consciousness”.48 Like Comte, Proudhon subscribes to the idea that society moves through three historical epochs, which Proudhon calls the religious, the metaphysical or philosophical stage, and the scientific. But unlike Comte, Proudhon argues that there is no transcendent telos to this progression, with one stage leaving the other behind. Indeed, the “divine”, or the hitherto unfathomable, lives on in and animates the scientific era. As War and Peace makes clear, for Proudhon, there is as much to learn about war and peace in the Bible as there is in Adolphe Thiers’s history of the French revolution, or Jomini’s geometric rules of military strategy. Each is a contingent reflection of the morality of its time, but no less illuminating about the human condition for that. Likewise, as the discussion of theodicy indicated, religious themes are secularised routinely, so understanding them helps us better grasp our own secularised ideals. In War and Peace, the writings of “the ancients” and “the moderns” are all treated as examples of what Proudhon calls “universal testimony”. These ideas are real, phenomenal, contingent and social, expressed in books and through practices, and they have causal effects that predispose us to psychological and social states of mind. pg 24</p>
    
    <p>Science, he argued, follows technological advances, which is why the industrial bourgeoisie and the scientific cadre of society, were at the forefront of history, with him it’s High Priest. Our cognitive capacities are emergent from fixed biological traits, Comte thought. We are therefore the manifestations or products of biological forces we cannot shape, and social forces we had no hand in creating. Free will is a dangerous fiction, Comte thought, leading to an individualist “anarchy” that would divert people from the true path of “order and progress” – the Comtean motto still inscribed on the Brazilian flag. Understood in this way, it is little wonder Proudhon refused to associate with Comte. Nevertheless, Proudhon’s twin concepts of “collective reason” and “collective force” are as indebted to Comte as they are to Kant. Proudhon agreed that we are shaped by the past, and that this is both an intellectual and material structuring of our ideas and our society. War and Peace is a case study of this process. But he diverges from Comte in defending the sovereign autonomy of individuals. Like Comte, he argues that “collective beings are just as real as individuals”,49 but unlike for Comte, while groups are real, and are “very different from, often even quite opposite to the conclusions of the individual “I” […T]his conversion does not […] condemn individuality; it presupposes it”.50 Constance Hall has argued that Proudhon was “one of the first social thinkers to attempt the primitive synthesis of these levels of social reality”.51 The collective intentionality of these groups, just like our own individual intentionality, depends on how we organise (ourselves).52 Individuals/groups are an emergent property of multiple forces, from without, and within, both biological and intellectual. We and our society are never one, we are always already plural and emergent. The strength of personality and of groups lies in their power, or ability to direct their intentions. Proudhon divides power into two types: puissance, and pouvoir. The former is an unthinking force, including “inertia”53 but also, for example, a riot. Pouvoir, is a purposive, directed social power, what he calls “pouvoir sociale”.54 The quantity of social power is proportional to the internal “relational law” of a given collective force or rationality. In other words, how well organised the group/individual is, is not reducible to the virtues (or vices) of the individuals that compose it, but how they relate to one another. Despite this innovative social theory, like Comte, Proudhon was convinced that while there was a wide variety of men and women, men and women had fixed natures that distinguished them from one another, and this underpinned his anti-feminism. Miscegenation may equalise the races, but it could not, he thought, equalise the relations between men and women. Proudhon understood the purpose of his mutualist social science as an attempt to develop better ways of organising society to enable the fullest possible human flourishing, or “justice” within the parameters of this sexist social ontology.55 Proudhon’s differences with Kant and Comte can also be seen in their respective readings of the history of the European revolutionary wars. Both Comte and Kant believed war’s providential purpose lay in its production of positivist or republican states respectively.56 While there may be practical or prudent reasons for going to war, these pale into insignificance in comparison with the historical and providential causes of, and reasons for war, reasons beyond the comprehension of the average mind. For Kant, war compels the creation of the “civil commonwealth”. It is a “pathologically enforced social union transformed into a moral whole”.57 For Kant this providential outcome is vital for realizing perpetual peace, but for Comte, necessary for the evolution of positivism and the state: “The only means by which human association can be carried to its fullest extent is [through] Labour. But the first steps in the development of labour suppose the pre-existence of large societies; and these can be founded only by War. Now the formation of large societies came to pass naturally from the spontaneous tendency of military activity to establish the universal dominion”. pg 25-26</p>
    
    <p>This developmentalist thesis, which Proudhon objected to so strongly, were at the heart of modern sociology and political science for a century. While he may have objected to their conclusions, Proudhon’s starting point and method are strikingly similar. Like Kant, Proudhon begins with antagonism. As he puts it: “Something widely acknowledged, in that it is a matter of experience, is that civilization has antagonism as its starting point, and that society, or in other words, rights, international law, public law and civil law have evolved under the inspiration and influence of war, which is to say, under the jurisdiction of force”.59 War, then is, the expression of moral, social, economic and political antagonisms. It is also an ajudicator. Go through all the histories and you will find not a single thing to contradict this theory. It carries its certainty with it. War is the verdict delivered by force; it is the assertion of right and the prerogatives of force by force of arms; it turns into a nonsense as soon as some contrivance is used to score a victory over force. Which is why the waging of war does not end on the battle-field. Conquest, which is its ultimate purpose, only becomes final with the assimilation of the conquered. Unless that condition is fulfilled, victories are just odious dragonnades and conquerors merely despicable charlatans chastised sooner or later by the force they misuse.60 All of our institutions are thus temporary truces, not the pinnacle of civilization, and our laws are the codification of the existing and historic relations of force in society. Right is the endlessly emergent property of relations of force. As he puts it: “force on its own proves nothing; it has to be authorized and commanded by a higher power, which is itself the organ and representative of justice. Since no such authority exists, the right of peoples has no guarantor other than the reason and morality of governments, which is to say, that, in reality, the right of peoples rests on thin air”.61 This rhetorical flourish obscures the deeper point he makes here and above: historically speaking, it is not reason alone, or any authority derived from it, which grounds order and right, but crucially force. pg 27</p>
    
    <p>The interests of the rich could only be satisfied through the expropriation of the poor or the conquest of foreign lands. Book four of War and Peace turns to political economy to illustrate this argument. The basic per capita daily income needed in 1861, Proudhon argued, was around “3.50 francs”.62 This baseline level of subsistence is what Proudhon called “poverty” and Proudhon lauds it. Like Tolstoy who follows him here, Proudhon argued that temperance, frugality and work are our lot, and simple tastes are more easily met through a sustainable balance of production and consumption.63 The gastronomes and epicureans, the materialists, and encourage others to do so too. This causes “ruptures in the economic equilibrium”, because luxuries become “a levy on essentials”.64 When there is nothing left in the coffers to pay off the people, the ruling class will go to war to address the “rupture” or contradiction this causes. War begets war, and, Proudhon argues, the people pay. “We are the offspring of heroes, they used to say, with their heads full of Homer. In fact, the topic most frequently mentioned in The Iliad and The Odyssey is loot”.65 pg 28</p>
    
    <p>The epics relate how pirates were transformed not just into kings, but into Gods, who later associated their estate with the state and then both with themselves. Today, Proudhon argues, liberal tropes of liberty, fraternity and equality enable the army to “feed on its own people”,66 “turning citizenry into fodder for their soldiers”.67 In the presence of this imbalance, this pauperism, “society is always in a state of war”68 and “politics is warfare”.69 pg 28</p>
    
    <p>he argued “In labour, production follows upon destruction; forces used up are resurrected again out of their dissolution, with renewed vigour”.70 Elsewhere Proudhon says “just as the hero proves himself in the fray, so the worker can be judged by his handiwork”.71 The worry was the emerging prevalence of “militarisme”, a term he coins here.72 Rather than labour shape the future, the more likely outcome was the further centralisation of states, the militarisation of state and society, and the turning of workers into cannon fodder. Only “federation” could lead us away from the travesties he foresaw. Society must be organised, he argued, not from the top down, but from the bottom up. “I will concede that we can only come up with an as yet indefinite notion of the economic arrangement which, I contend, should take over from the reign of politics or war”,73 he says but: “The establishment of right in humanity is the very abolition of warfare; it is the organisation of peace”.74 pg 29</p>
    
    <p>By linking war to justice, Proudhon also historicises systems of right and the rights of peoples. This, in turn, deflates the grandiose claims about the providential character of the state in human history, and shows how political right emerges from the bottom up. This illumination of the relationship between violence and justice made a significant and lasting impression on writers as diverse as Leo Tolstoy and Michel Foucault, Raymond Aron and Georges Sorel. Tolstoy would reject all law except conscience on the basis of Proudhon's association of positive law with state violence. Foucault would historicise the state in much the same way as Proudhon, refusing the grand teleologies of modernity in favour of a discontinuous, positive history of the state. Aron, Foucault's contemporary deployed Proudhon's historicised ethics in the service of a pluralist international morality in a thermonuclear age, and Sorel used Proudhon's moral phenomenology of violence to explain the virtues of the syndicalist general strike. pg 30-31</p>
    
    <p>But if so much was made of this text by such significant twentieth century writers, why is the book not better known in Anglo-American circles? The reason for this is at least partly due to the association of Proudhon's theory of war and peace with conservative and reactionary political thought. A brief survey of this association will help set up the value of the more plausible readings. For all its insight, for all the moral value of defending individual and collective sovereignty and the mutual dignity of all, Proudhon’s philosophy of history is racist and sexist. He was neither the first nor the last to espouse such views, but a highly selective reading of his arguments about martial valour, the family and the historic virtues of religion and personal property as a bulwark against the state, led to Proudhon becoming a key intellectual marker on the French right, and for those on the left who sought to discredit him by associating him with fascism.75 Proudhon’s anti-feminism and his racism are both based on the same error: ignorance and prejudice. As mentioned above, Proudhon believed that men, women had fixed natures: women were two thirds weaker than men, physically and intellectually. While races had characteristics that changed as they intermingled and mixed, the capacities of women were fixed by nature. A woman’s social role was to enable her husband as a housewife. For example, below he argues that, “The people are of a mind with women. The man of war is noble everywhere; he represents a caste. The slave has no entitlement to lay a finger on weapons; he would be dishonouring combat. If his master would but allow him to arm himself, that very act alone would make him a free man; what is more, it would bestow nobility upon him”.76 However, where slaves might rightly take up arms, women cannot be combatants: “War conjures up a colossal and irretrievable inequality between man and woman. For anyone who has once and for all grasped this great law of our nature, war, the fact of woman’s unsuitability in warfare speaks volumes. Woman only truly exists in the family context. Outside of it, all her worth is borrowed; she cannot be anything and has no entitlement to amount to anything, for the crucial reason that she is not suited to combat”.77 This is of course untrue. But what is going on here? There is no doubt that this is set of first order contradictions in Proudhon’s thought, so how does he reconcile them with his anarchism and egalitarianism – his theory of justice? To begin with, Proudhon dabbled with phrenology, a branch of nascent race science in the nineteenth century that posited that the size and shape of the skull was a direct indication of the character and moral worth of a person. For example, he argues below that “The Caucasian stands out from all the others and not merely on account of fairness of face and elegance of figure; there is a superiority of physical, intellectual and moral strength”.78 A similar scientific consensus underpinned his sexism. Proudhon also defended the common idea that women played no active role in procreation – they were a receptacle for “the seed” (a not uncommon belief at the time), making them naturally passive, while men were naturally active.79 This translated into masculine virility and strength and feminine beauty. These were characteristics that attracted men and women to one another and constituted a natural balance between them – an incarnation of justice. The problem is the social state in which women and men find themselves. To continue the quote from above, Proudhon argues that the “superiority of [Caucasian] nature is increased tenfold by the social state, so that no race can stand in our way. A few English regiments contain and govern one hundred and twenty million Indians, and we have just seen that it took only a tiny army of Europeans to conquer China. What comparison can there be between the Anglo-Saxon and the Redskin who would rather death than civilization, or the negro imported from the Sudan?”80 Like all racism, these claims are the product of ignorance, and were/are shared by many on the left and right. Like Marx, Proudhon argued that it is because society is unequal that we need a division of labour, and given the iniquities of capitalism, only a transformation of social conditions could progressively equalise natural inequalities. Capitalism transformed slaves into wage slaves; only socialism could free workers. But Proudhon's anti-feminism went shamefully further.81 Proudhon believed French society was in decline due to the emasculation of men and the widespread attacks on the institution of the family and marriage. Proudhon thought that left to fend for themselves, outside the family, in society, women would be exploited sexually and socially. He blamed the Saint Simonians for this social malaise, in particular their campaign against the bourgeois marriage contract (which effectively made women chattel) and their concomitant defence of free love. Bourgeoise male dalliance and endemic concubinage was rife at this time: “modern life is killing our women”, he wrote to Langlois.82 The solutions to natural “infirmity” included marriage for women, “miscegenation” (the intermingling of “races”), and education and work for the previously enslaved. While women would never reach the heights of men, men, whatever colour, had the same natural capacity for hard work and learning. But the biological difference between the sexes (but not “races”) was insurmountable: men and women could never be full equals. It was for these reasons that women had to be confined to the home, he thought: the family unit protected women, and equalised this physical inequality, giving women a social function suitable to their relative biological capacity. pg 32-33</p>
    
    <p>the 1927 editor of Proudhon’s War and Peace, Henri Moysset, took a Ministerial role in Marshall Pétain’s collaborationist government in 1941. In the aftermath of the Second World War and the Holocaust, Proudhon was not the only socialist labelled “a harbinger of fascism”, but it seems to have stuck to him more so than others.85 Proudhon’s sexism and racism was ignored (rather than exposed and criticised) by those who sought to develop his thiking in more progressive directions. Four notable examples also help us understand the text and its historical significance: Leo Tolstoy, George Sorel and the Sociology department at the Sorbonne, including two of its most notable luminaries, Rayomnd Aron and Michel Foucault. pg 34</p>
    
    <p>In 1861, Tolstoy received a written introduction from Alexander Herzen, a mutual friend, correspondent and comrade, and paid Proudhon a visit as he was putting the finishing touches to War and Peace and still searching for a publisher. In a letter to his lawyer Gustave Chaudey, on the 7th of April, 1861, Proudhon recalls spending a few days with Tolstoy, who he described as a “hugely knowledgeable” man.86 pg 34</p>
    
    <p>Tolstoy’s pacifism was no doubt derived from these and no doubt other more horrific experiences of the front line. In addition, Tolstoy’s asceticism is strikingly reminiscent of Proudhon’s arguments for temperance, frugality and toil in Book Four below. But his philosophy of history and of war was almost certainly shaped by his reading of Proudhon’s War and Peace. When Proudhon died, in January 1865, Tolstoy was in the midst of penning his own magnum opus, The Year 1805, which was released in serialised form in The Russian Messenger between 1865 and 1867. Two months after Proudhon’s death, on April 13th 1865, Tolstoy remarked in his diary that Proudhon’s dictum, “property is theft is […] is an absolute truth”.90 When Tolstoy decided to republish the serialised novel in two volumes in 1867, he renamed it War and Peace. pg 35</p>
    
    <p>Sorel’s Reflections on Violence combines a Proudhonist theory of violence, and a Marxist theory of class conflict. pg 37</p>
    
    <p>Sorel argues that society is constituted by the ideological phenomenology of violence (including non-violence). The latent or explicit myths of (non) violence are partly constitutive of how social groups understand their relations to one another: violence is experienced in, through and as social hierarchy, domination and inequality. Where Tolstoy and Gandhi pursued pacifist non-violence, Sorel advocates the general strike. The general strike need not be physically violent to be understood as violence, since what the general strike achieves, even in the absence of violence, is the articulation or enactment of class consciousness and resistance: a new idelogy of violence would bring about radical social change by collapsing the bourgeois order.99 Through the syndicate and the general strike, the working class comes to understand itself as a social group, and through the institutionalization of this counter-power, in education, social insurance, health provision and so on, the working class “builds the new in the shell of the old”, to borrow the words of the Industrial Workers of the World. Where Proudhon hoped that the emergence of the industrial working class would bring about a general pacification of society, for Sorel, writing forty years later, it had rather hardened battle lines. In Proudhonist prose with a Marxist inflection, Sorel wrote that class war and the general strike are the new motor of history. pg 39</p>
    
    <p>Sorel argues that proletarian violence seeks to transform society, not to destroy it. By contrast, the republican state, in outlawing the general strike or revolutionary acts of violence in the name of peace, monopolizes the right to violence, pacifying society in the interest of the ruling classes. Republicanism does not remove violence from politics but relocates it. It is for these reasons that Sorel rejected the parliamentary path to social change: “if, by chance, our parliamentary socialists come to power they will prove themselves worthy successors of the Inquisition, of the ancient régime and of Robespierre”.101 In this he was right, but whether the general strike, the embodiment of new modern industrial consciousness, can set society upon a stable footing , is another matter. Proudhon’s proselytisers in the Sorbonne at this time were less militant but the influence of War and Peace was no less significant. Celestin Bouglé, a holder of Emile Durkheim’s chair of Sociology, placed Proudhon alongside Comte and Durkheim, as a progenitor of French sociology.102 Following Proudhon, Bouglé sought to establish “collective conscience” as an independent object of analysis for modern sociology. Perhaps unsurprising in itself, the significance is twofold: first, this established a clear separation between French sociology and Marxist materialist reductionism, and secondly, it enabled a political critique of state centralisation and a defence of decentralised federalism. The recovery of Proudhon was central to both these moves. pg 40</p>
    
    <p>Stanley Hoffman, who wrote about Proudhon’s political geography, was Professor of Political Science at Harvard, and a key proselytiser of Aron’s ideas in the United States.104 Hoffmann distanced himself from Aron’s more conservative politics, as did many, particularly around the time of the May 1968 uprising in Paris, but Hoffman was a central character in the development of American International Relations scholarship in the 1970s. One of Aron’s colleagues, Georges Gurvitch, who also held the Durkheim chair of Sociology, used Proudhon’s writings to theorise the sociology of knowledge and law, and popularised Proudhon’s philosophy in turn.105 Gurvitch was critical of Proudhon’s views on colonialism, and his anti-colonial views of Algerian independence made him a target of far right terrorism.106 But in locating collective conscience and individual reason at the heart of sociology, Gurvitch was also a central figure in the development of French epistemology. pg 41</p>
    
    <p>One hundred years after Proudhon’s call to “demonarchise the universe”, Foucault famously lamented that “In thought and political analysis we have still not cut off the head of the king”. pg 41</p>
    
    <p>Following Canguilhem and Comte’s positivist unification of the human sciences, Foucault also sought to broaden the understanding of politics, from adminstration to a sociology of power. Like Proudhon, Foucault saw governance as techniques of social control, the management of bodies and of populations. Central to this was force. It is in Society Must be Defended that we see this Proudhonist account of war and force most clearly. But Foucault has to begin by releasing left politics from the hold of Marxist reductionism in the analysis of power. Power cannot be reduced to repression caused by the economic means of production, he argues. Power is a much more plural “implementation and deployment of a relationship of force” which we can theorise as “war”. “At this point, we can invert Clausewitz’s proposition and say that politics is the continuation of war by other means. This would imply […] that power relations, as they function in a society like ours, are essentially anchored in a certain relationship of force that was established in and through war at a given historical moment that can be historically specified”.110 The echoes of Proudhon are striking. With this Proudhonist conception of force and war in hand, Foucault offers an alternative historical method. In “Nietzsche, Genealogy, History”, he argues that genealogy is not a search for origins, nor a linear history, but an account of history that is “always produced through a particular stage of forces”, with “insurmountable conflict” as its basic point of inquiry.111 Genealogy is a history of the present, one which takes discontinuities and ruptures as a primary feature of the development of society. Like Proudhon, Foucault is happy to tell an empirical story about the emergence of the present, but refuses to argue that there is a transcendent telos to that historical process. Like Proudhon, Foucault also recognises the evolution of moral orders and their role in rationalising, or “disciplining” society. Both Foucault and Proudhon use the term “governementalisme” to describe this and, notwithstanding certain key differences, both understand it as a certain mentality of rule adopted first by statesmen, who are shaped by it in turn, and then internalised by the rest of society.112 Also, both understand government as much more than the writing and enacting of laws, and more as “governance”. Let me turn to each of these claims in turn. The concept of governementalisme is first developed in Proudhon’s “Election Manifesto” of 1848, where he rebukes a form of thinking, typical of republican politicians, that reduces the problem of the realisation of freedom to technical and instrumental policy problems. A year later, in Confessions of a Revolutionary (1849), Proudhon here equates communism with governmentalism and technocracy, and argues that through the conscious centralisation of government, the ability of the people to self-govern is removed. What we are left with is government “[f]or the people, but all by the State”.113 Proudhon then uses the term “governmentalisme” three times in General Idea of the Revolution (1851), to refer to a logic of rule, a mentality that politicians adopt in power. What is unique in this latter work is that by now his conception of political power has also widened from the instruments of the state to a more encompassing mode of governance: To be GOVERNED is to be kept in sight, inspected, spied upon, directed, law-driven, numbered, enrolled, indoctrinated, preached at, controlled, estimated, valued, censured, commanded, by creatures who have neither the right, nor the wisdom, nor the virtue to do so. . . To be GOVERNED is to be at every operation, at every transaction, noted, registered, enrolled, taxed, stamped, measured, numbered, assessed, licensed, authorized, admonished, forbidden, reformed, corrected, punished […].114 This is arguably one of the most ubiquitous citations from Proudhon’s works. But here, ten years later in War and Peace, he develops this position considerably. Now, governance is a process: “as governmentalism grows, it deepens”,115 “the Old Continent’s monarchical, communist and governmentalist instincts […] wields a powerful influence over civilization generally, even now”.116 Here we see Proudhon hinting at one of the most striking developments in political theory in the twentieth century: Foucault’s governmentality. pg 42-43</p>
    
    <p>Foucault’s understanding of neoliberal governmentality is a unique contemporary articulation of this Proudhonist problematique. For Foucault, governmentality is a process of self-rule, internalised by neoliberal subjects and consumers. This insidious form of self-government reproduces and embeds structures of domination through our habitual daily actions, leading us to self-pacify as part of what it means to be an upstanding member of a peaceful, liberal community.117 Society has been pacified not by the rebalancing of social forces in the name of justice, or through practicing the virtues of frugality, temperance and thrift, as Proudhon hoped, but by liberal subjects having come to identify with, and administer their own material subjugation. pg 44</p>
