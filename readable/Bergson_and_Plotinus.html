The aim of this study is to examine what is explicit and speculate on  what is implicit in the texts, and to argue they both replicate the Pythagorean tradition  by proposing a philosophy of dynamic transformation underpinned by two fundamental  and interlinked premises: a universe generated and governed by a natural law of  musical harmonics , and the concept of kairos as time signifying the emergence of  qualitative change.  Following an examination of the revival of Pythagoreanism in the eras of  Plotinus and Bergson, the concepts central to Pythagorean cosmogony, cosmology and  theory of harmonics are explained.  It is proposed these concepts, together with the  mechanism of procession and reversion explain the generation and evolution of </p><div id="pagenum"><p>2</p></div><p id="page">2   Plotinus’ Intellect and Soul as an integrated compound series consisting of a  fundamental vibration and its self-generated harmonics, thus potentially clarifying the  nature of the forms, λόγος, the decad, and the various levels of Soul.  Furthermore, that  Pythagorean concepts and the harmonics model are also at work in Bergson’s  cosmology, in the impulsion and inversion of the élan vital , demonstrating consistency  with his arguments for partial finalism, theory of number and the influence of  mathematics.  It is argued that for Plotinus and Bergson, contemplation and intuition  respectively is kairos, the moment in which mind and matter, sense perception and  memory, freedom and determinacy, integrate, an integration grounded by the  harmonics model.  This new interpretation suggests a previously unacknowledged Pythagorean  influence on Bergson and an underestimation of the influence on Plotinus.  Significantly, it clarifies ambiguities, challenges old perceptions, reinforces the  influence of Plotinus on Bergson, and provides a novel perspective for further re- evaluation of the texts and secondary literature.                        </p><div id="pagenum"><p>3</p></div><p id="page">i   BERGSON, PLOTINUS  and the   HARMONICS of EVOLUTION       Contents     *    Acknowledgements iv  List of Illustrations v  List of Abbreviations vi    Introduction 1  Chapter 1   Philosophical and Historical Background  Introduction 11  1.1    Pythagoras and Pythagoreanism 11  1.2    The Pythagorean Influence in the Era of Plotinus 15  1.3    The Pythagorean Influence in the Era of Bergson 19  Conclusion 31    Chapter 2   The Pythagoreans - The Generation of Multiplicity  Introduction 32  2.1    Pythagorean Cosmogony and Cosmology 33  2.1.1    Nature    33  2.1.2    The Principles of Limiting and Unlimited 35                                   2.1.3    Harmonia (ἁρμονία) 37  2.1.4    The Pythagorean Monad 37  2.2    A Brief History of Pythagorean Harmonics and Number Theory 42  2.3    An Introduction to the Pythagorean Science of Harmonics 46                                                                      2.4    Number as Dynamis  51                        Conclusion 58   </p><div id="pagenum"><p>4</p></div><p id="page">ii   Chapter 3   Plotinus - The Generation and Nature of Intellect  Introduction 60  3.1    Plotinus’ Principle of Unity – The One (τὸ ἕν) 61  3.2    The Generation and Nature of Intellect, the Form of the First Forms 64  3.3    The Generation of Intellect as Beings 74                                                             3.4    Intelligible Matter, Logos and Substance in the Enneads 82  3.5    The Generation and Nature of Being as Substantial Number 89  Conclusion 98    Chapter 4   Plotinus - The Generation of Soul and Origin of Matter  Introduction  100  4.1    The Levels of Soul and their Relationship with Intellect  101  4.2    The World Soul , Providence and the Making of the Universe 106  4.3    The Integration of Body and Soul 112  4.4    The Nature and Origin of Matter (ύλη)  123  Conclusion 133    Chapter 5   Bergson - God, the Élan Vital  and the Generation of Multiplicity        Introduction  136  5.1    Bergson’s Principle of Unity - God/ Élan Vital  137  5.2    The Nature and Mechanism of the Élan Vital  149  5.3    The Ontological and Epistemological Transformation of the Élan Vital  157   Conclusion 169    Chapter 6   Bergson - Harmonics of Evolution  Introduction 171  6.1    Bergson’s Partial Finalism 172  6.2    The Role of Number in Bergson’s Creative Evolution 181  6.3    Bergson and Mathematics 188  6.4    Bergson and Pythagorean Number Theory 194  6.5    Bergson and Pythagorean Philosophy 199  6.6    Bergson and Metaphor 203  Conclusion 208    </p><div id="pagenum"><p>5</p></div><p id="page">iii   Chapter 7   Kairos (Kαιρός)  Introduction 210  7.1    Chronos and Kairos in Ancient Greece 211  7.2    Kairos in the Pythagorean Tradition 215  7.3    An Introduction to Kairos in Plotinus and Bergson 221    Chapter 8   Plotinus and Kairos  Introduction 222  8.1    Kairos and the World Soul 223  8.2    Kairos and the Individual Soul 226  8.2.1    Sense perception 228  8.2.2    Reasoning and Memory 236  8.3    The Freedom of the Individual Soul 247  Conclusion 251     Chapter 9   Bergson and Kairos  Introduction 254  9.1    Perception, Memory, and Kairos 255  9.1.1    Pure Perception 256  9.1.2    The Preservation of Memories 262  9.1.3    The Recognition and Recollection of Memories 266  9.2    Bergson and Freedom 272  9.3    Kairos in Bergson’s Philosophical Method 279  Conclusion 289     Conclusion 291  Bibliography 310    Appendix 1 - Introduction to the Black Notebook  Appendix 2 - Bergson’s Lectures on the Pythagoreans  Appendix 3 - Introduction to Bergson’s Lectures on Plotinus  Appendix 4 - Bergson’s Lectures on Plotinus </p><div id="pagenum"><p>6</p></div><p id="page">iv   Acknowledgements    *      I would like to express my thanks to my supervisors, Professor Alison Assiter and Dr.  Sean Watson for their guidance, support and encouragement throughout the years it has  taken to bring this thesis to completion.

(Plato, Philebus, 17c11-e1, in Kennedy, 2011, p.viii)    The link between Bergson and Plotinus has long been acknowledged.  Émile Bréhier,  who attended Bergson’s lectures on Plotinus, commented: “Plotinus is one of the very  rare philosophers with whom Bergson felt an affinity… he treated him, as if he  recognised himself in Plotinus” (Bréhier, 1949, pp.107-108).  Despite Bergson’s  affinity with Plotinus, the only Bergson scholar to publish a comprehensive work on  the significance of Plotinus on his philosophy is Rose-Marie Mossé-Bastide whose  Bergson et Plotin , published in French in 1959, is no longer in print and has never been  translated into English.  Since then, only a few articles have specifically addressed the  Plotinus/Bergson relationship.  Bergson describes Plotinus as his “favourite philosopher” and Mossé-Bastide  demonstrated a sympathy or meeting of minds in her examination of the shared </p><div id="pagenum"><p>10</p></div><p id="page">2   concepts and differences of their respective philosophies.  She proposed that Bergson’s  ‘creative evolution’ is a “dynamic schema” that is “rooted in the philosophy of  Plotinus” (Mossé-Bastide, 1959, p.355), having developed it further by integrating the  generative functions of Plotinus’ hypostases, Intellect and Soul, within his concept of  duration.  The aim of this study is to build upon Mossé-Bastide’s work and to support the  thesis that the “dynamic schema” underlying both their philosophies is rooted in the  science of harmonics and philosophy of the Pythagorean tradition, an influence  underestimated by commentators on Plotinus, and previously unrecognised by  commentators on Bergson.    The Pythagorean influence on Plotinus arises from its philosophical influence on  Plato, and its revival in the first and second centuries A.D. by Neo-Pythagorean  philosophers including Moderatus, Nicomachus, Numenius, and Plotinus’ teacher  Ammonius Saccas.  It must be noted that while being referred to as Neopythagoreans,  they considered themselves to be Platonists (Dillon, 2014, p.250).  O’Meara comments:    Plotinus regards himself as interpreting Plato, who expresses with greater clarity  truths obscurely and partially indicated by Pythagoras. (O’Meara, 2014, p.404)    The Pythagorean legacy Plotinus continued is slowly coming to light, with Stamatellos’  Plotinus and the Presocratics (Stamatellos, 2007) and Slaveva-Griffin’s Plotinus on  Number (Slaveva-Griffin, 2009) being of particular relevance, and it will be proposed  that a deeper analysis of the text reveals the nature of the legacy to be of paramount  importance to our understanding of the Enneads.    The Pythagorean influence on Bergson could have presented itself through  personal, educational, scientific, and other cultural influences, and it will be argued that  like Plotinus there is a Pythagorean influence buried within the text.  Stephen Clark, </p><div id="pagenum"><p>11</p></div><p id="page">3   author of Plotinus: Myth, Metaphor and Philosophical Practice , suggests that while  some scholars believe exegesis must be confined to “what the text says” without  speculating on it, “scholarly exegesis simply of the text cannot be all we do” because  “all philosophers have more beliefs than they write down, beliefs that may influence  their arguments” and to understand the text “we have to make our own assumptions  about what it might reasonably say”.  In referring to Plotinus he proposes that we shall  not understand the Enneads until “we can make a worthwhile guess about what is not  said, and develop them in ways Plotinus did not, quite possibly, intend”.  Clark claims  that this is what Plotinus did with Plato (Clark, 2016, pp. xii-xvi), and it is suggested  this is what Bergson did with Plotinus.  The task of this project is however to present an  interpretation of the texts and make a “worthwhile guess” about what they do not say   with a view to revealing the real intentions rather than developing them in ways that  they did not intend.  In this context the conception of “worthwhile” is to make sense of  aspects of the texts scholars have found challenging and therefore remain unexplained,  as well as promoting greater understanding among all who read the texts.  There are a number of aspects of the Enneads Plotinian scholars have found  obscure and remain the subject of debate, for example, why procession and reversion  are necessary for the generation of Intellect and the multiplicity within it; the nature  and shape of the forms; the nature of logos (λόγος); how number relates to the primary  kinds and generates the Beings in Intellect, as well as the nature of the Plotinian decad.   There are also disagreements amongst scholars concerning his account of Soul and  matter, as well as the role of music and musical metaphors in the Enneads.  While many commentators on Bergson note certain ambiguities in his work,  particularly in Creative Evolution  concerning the nature and generative process of the  élan vital , and his theory of perception in Matter and Memory , in general much of the </p><div id="pagenum"><p>12</p></div><p id="page">4   later work presents a summary of his philosophy, and there appears to be an attitude of  acceptance of the ambiguities, with little effort to resolve them; hence there tends to be  a lack of disagreement or debate amongst modern Bergsonian scholars.  It is anticipated  the arguments presented in the following chapters will help to resolve some of the  ambiguities and stimulate debate.  My thesis is that there are two fundamental dominant and interlinked themes that  Plotinus and Bergson have assimilated from the Pythagorean tradition: the ancient  Greek science of  harmonics and the concept of kairos.  A brief introduction to them is  therefore appropriate.  The origin of the science of harmonics has been traced to  Pythagoras (c.530 B.C.) who is said to have discovered that musical intervals could be  expressed as ratios.  He was the founder of a Pythagorean tradition that considered a  divine cosmos in which multiplicity is generated from a central point of power and  remains unified in the generative process because it is ordered according to a natural  law of musical harmonics based on numerical ratios.  ‘Proportion’ was therefore  integral to their cosmogony, cosmology, and intimately linked to their religious values,  ethics and practice of medicine.  Musical harmonics was considered a science, along  with geometry and astronomy, for which arithmetic was considered foundational.   The science of harmonics is also closely linked with kairos, one of the concepts  the ancient Greeks utilized for time; the other is chronos.  Chronos is chronological,  sequential, quantitative or measured time, while kairos is purely qualitative as a  moment of action or timing, an occasion signifying the emergence of qualitative change  that is situation specific.  Kairos is essential in the ontological structure of the shaping  of the moment, and so represents the Pythagorean notion of time always present within  the natural evolutionary process involving real change.  The Pythagoreans  acknowledged it in the outer world as well as the inner; in the outer world kairos was </p><div id="pagenum"><p>13</p></div><p id="page">5   considered as a moment of necessity or providence and in the human inner world it is  the moment of the free act based on good judgement.  A survey of the literature reveals  that kairos is largely neglected by scholars of  Plotinus and Bergson, particularly in the English language literature.  The articles  written in French are very general in nature and include contributions from Vladimir  Jankélévitch (Jankélévitch, 1959) and J.M. Gebaude (Gebaude, 1991), who has written  specifically about the concept in Bergson’s philosophy, while E. Moutsopoulos, a  philosopher of kairicity, has written about its relevance to the philosophy of Plotinus  (Moutsopoulos, 1984; 1991).    Harmonics and kairos have a dynamic and transformative character and entail the  integration or synthesis of natural philosophy and psychology.  Bergson refers  specifically to harmonics, almost as an aside in some of his texts, but does not mention  kairos, whereas Plotinus refers to kairos but does not mention harmonics.  Neither  philosopher refers to them explicitly as grounding principles; however, it will be argued  that they are implicit in the texts, and the philosophy of Plotinus and Bergson only  makes sense if it is founded on the model of harmonics, a theory that once understood,  has the potential to resolve many of the perceived ambiguities in their work and re- enforces their philosophical connection.  It is therefore anticipated that the thesis will  be of interest to historians of philosophy as well as to scholars of Plotinus and Bergson.   Furthermore, since it potentially transforms our understanding of their metaphysics it  will raise the profile of harmonics and kairos in the field of metaphysics in general.    This is the first time that harmonics and kairos have been studied in both  philosophers; hence the arguments presented rely heavily on analysis of the text of the  Enneads and Bergson’s work.  The level of analysis required and the potential  importance of the interpretation arising from that analysis has meant, perhaps </p><div id="pagenum"><p>14</p></div><p id="page">6   surprisingly, for a thesis on the history of philosophy, that it has been necessary to be  selective whilst being comparative.  For example, although presumed to be highly  influential on Plotinus, the role of Pythagorean harmonics in Plato’s texts, particularly  in the Timaeus where he uses Pythagorean harmonic ratios in his cosmology ( Timaeus  35a-37e), has not been addressed in detail because significant work on how Plato  applied Pythagorean harmonics in his dialogues has already been published by  commentators.  Barker writes about Plato’s musical ethics in the Republic and Laws, as  well as harmonics in the Republic and Timaeus (Barker, 2007, pp. 308- 327); Cornford  examines harmonics in the Timaeus (Cornford, 1935); Crickmore suggests how  Pythagorean harmonics underpins Plato’s political and moral theory in the Republic  (Crickmore, 2006); Kennedy proposes that a stichometric analysis of Plato ’s  Symposium  and Euthyphro  reveals a musical scale built i n to the text (Kennedy, 2011);  McClain explains how Pythagorean mathematics and harmonics was influential in key  dialogues such as the Republic, Timaeus, Critias, Statesman  and Laws (McClain,  1978); Pelosi investigates Plato ’s philosophy of music as it relates to the body and soul  (Pelosi, 2010) and Moro Tornese has examined the theories of music and harmony in  Proclus' commentaries on Plato's Timaeus and Republic (Moro Tornese, 2010; 2017).   Due to the extensive nature of addressing how Plato incorporated Pythagorean  harmonics into his philosophy it is deemed prudent to explore how Plotinus takes  metaphysics beyond Plato to a level in which the ratios of musical harmonics have a  basis in modern physics.  The need to be selective has also entailed the isolation of  Bergson from his acknowledged philosophical influence of French Spiritualism, a  detailed analysis of which would divert from the focus of the thesis.  While Bergson  disagreed with aspects of Plato’s philosophy to the extent that Plato could be  considered an influence that separates Bergson philosophically from Plotinus, one of </p><div id="pagenum"><p>15</p></div><p id="page">7   the key conclusions of the thesis is that Pythagoreanism is the tradition that unites them  more strongly than previously realised.  The scope of the thesis is therefore limited to a  comparison of the philosophy of Plotinus and Bergson with the Pythagorean tradition.    Chapter Synopsis    This study will be presented in nine Chapters and a Conclusion.  Chapter One places  the proposed Pythagorean influence on Bergson and Plotinus within its philosophical  and historical context to provide important background information that supports the  examination of the interlinked concepts of harmonics and kairos explored in  subsequent chapters.  The Chapter opens with a brief history of Pythagoreanism and  then examines the influence of Pythagoreanism in the eras of Plotinus and Bergson.   Chapter Two provides an important, but necessarily brief introduction to the  concepts central to Pythagorean cosmogony and cosmology because they will be  referred to in subsequent chapters: Nature, the Principles of Limiting and Unlimited,  Harmonia (ἁρμονία), and the function of the Pythagorean Monad in their number  theory.  This is followed by a brief history of Pythagorean harmonics and number  theory, and a basic introduction to the Pythagorean science of harmonics.  Finally, it  will discuss the notion that within the science of harmonics the Pythagoreans conceived  numbers as powers.    Chapter Three examines the generation and nature of Intellect in the Enneads.  It  commences with an explanation of Plotinus’ theory of the One as the first principle of  unity, and the source of multiplicity.  This is followed by a summary of Plotinus’  account of the generation of Being and Intellect as an activity of procession away from  the One and reversion to the One.  It will be argued, with the help of illustrations, that  the generation of Intellect and its Beings takes the form of an integrated compound </p><div id="pagenum"><p>16</p></div><p id="page">8   series consisting of Intellect as a fundamental vibration and its Beings as self-generated  harmonics. This will be followed by clarification of the ontological status of logos as  the substance of the Beings in Intellect.  While commentators understand logos to  imply a logical ordering structure that is commonly defined as ‘rational forming  principle’ or ‘reason principle’, it will be proposed, following an examination of the  ancient Greek meaning of logos and the nature of logos as described by Plotinus, that it  could be defined more precisely as ‘ratio’, emulating the term used in the Pythagorean  tradition of musical harmonics.  Finally, by analysing how substantial number is  generated with the primary kinds: motion, rest, otherness and sameness, it will be  argued that Plotinus’ concept of Being consists in the decad, which is modelled on the  Pythagorean tetractys that represents the structural order or numerical organisation of  the universe.  Chapter Four continues the examination of Plotinus’ account of the generation of  multiplicity by examining the generation of Soul and origin of Matter.  It will reveal  how the harmonics model applies to the Hypostasis Soul  and the generation of the  World Soul  and Soul of individual souls, and their relationship to Intellect.  Then it  examines the role of ‘providence’ and harmonia  in the making of the universe by the  World Soul , and subsequently explains the application of the concepts of sympathia  and  synesis in the integration of body and Soul.  Finally, it examines the nature and origin of  matter.  It will be argued that the model of harmonics provides a solution to ambiguities  debated by scholars and that the Pythagorean influence on Plotinus is greater than  previously realised.  Chapter Five explores the nature of Bergson’s cosmology described in Creative  Evolution and provides a novel interpretation of how Bergson conceives the generation  of multiplicity according to the model of harmonics.  It commences with an </p><div id="pagenum"><p>17</p></div><p id="page">9   examination of the ambiguity surrounding the nature of the  élan vital and will argue that   Bergson followed Plotinus and the Pythagoreans in presenting a non-pantheist  philosophy in which the First Principle remains distinct from its products.  This is  followed with an explanation of the mechanism of the élan vital, and it will be  proposed, with the aid of illustrations, that it replicates Plotinus’ movements of  progression and reversion, thus  generating the ‘form’ of the élan vital  as the first  harmonic that subsequently divides itself into matter and consciousness as separate  tendencies, thus creating an impersonal supra-conscious memory as a series of  harmonics.    Chapter Six develops the argument that Bergson’s cosmology is modelled on the  generation of harmonics by examining his arguments for partial finalism, his theory of  number, and the influence of mathematics.  It will be proposed that since his arguments  are compatible with the 3-stage generative structure of Pythagorean cosmology, this  potential influence suggests that a re-evaluation of the influences normally attributed to  these concepts is necessary.  An examination of his lectures on the Pythagoreans will  reveal Bergson’s sympathy with Pythagorean number theory and philosophy of  transformation.  Finally, the commonly held view that Bergson’s theory of duration as a  melody is a metaphor will be discussed and contested.   Chapter Seven introduces the concept of kairos as it was understood in ancient  Greece by the Pythagoreans, as a prelude to explaining the nature of kairos in Plotinus  and Bergson.  It explains how kairos is connected to rhetoric under Pythagorean  influence.   Chapter Eight opens with an explanation of the nature of kairos in the Enneads in  respect of the role of freedom in the World Soul , and nature.  This is followed by an  examination of how kairos is implicated in the key concepts of sense perception, </p><div id="pagenum"><p>18</p></div><p id="page">10   memory, reason, and freedom as they relate to the individual soul, and it will claim that  perceived ambiguities can be resolved if the model of harmonics is applied to these  concepts.  Chapter Nine explores how Bergson utilises the ancient concept of kairos in the  model of harmonics in his theories of perception and memory as proposed in Matter  and Memory , and how kairos is intimately connected to his understanding of morality  and individual freedom as proposed in the Two Sources of Morality and Religion.   Finally, it will suggest that kairos in Bergson’s philosophical method of intuition may  have been inspired by ancient Greek rhetoric under the influence of the Pythagorean  tradition.  The thesis concludes with a summary of the main points and a discussion about  their relevance as well as opportunities for further work.     All references to Plotinus’ Enneads use the A. H.

Pythagoreanism  was not simply of historical importance to the ancient Greek schools; through its effect  on philosophy, science, as well as the wider culture of the respective eras in which both  philosophers lived, the impact on their lives would have been significant.  This Chapter  therefore introduces the Pythagorean tradition and examines the extent of its influence  in the eras of Plotinus and Bergson, thus providing historical context for the  philosophical influence that will be proposed in subsequent chapters.           1.1   Pythagoras and Pythagoreanism        Pythagoras was acknowledged to be a mathematician, philosopher, scientist, mystic,  and founder of a religious order in Croton, southern Italy.  Pythagoreans were either  acusmatici, i.e., those who only followed the tradition’s ethical practices; or  mathematici who employed themselves in mathematical or scientific study.1  Despite                                                                1  For a detailed account of the differences see: Burkert, W., 1972, pp.192-208; Zhmud, L.,      1994, pp.169-208. </p><div id="pagenum"><p>20</p></div><p id="page">12   the differences within the tradition its spiritual character permeated the whole system.   It was a culture whose religious values and ethics were based on the belief in a divine  cosmos ordered on ‘proportion’ or harmonic principles, the key to which is the function  of number, hence the integration or synthesis of psychology and natural philosophy.   The scientific pursuit of harmony or order in nature facilitated the attainment of the  religious ideal of the unity and harmony of the soul and the divine cosmos (Guthrie,  1962, p.246).   The primary sources of information about Pythagoreanism are Aristotle,  Nicomachus, Porphyry and Iamblichus, and according to Iamblichus’s Life of  Pythagoras , the concept of silence was an integral part of the religious ideal of unity, as  Riedweg comments:  …the Pythagoreans saw the practice of silence not only as a way of achieving  ascetic self-mastery but also for the training for the duty to keep the teachings  secret. (Riedweg, 2008, p.101)    Initiates were expected to follow a vegetarian diet and to maintain physical, mental and  emotional balance at all times, facilitated by the therapeutic effects of music.  The  primacy attributed to harmonics and music arises because Pythagoras is said to have  discovered that musical intervals could be expressed as ratios, hence the Pythagorean  tradition considered numerical ratios as universal principles that revealed a harmonia ,  or natural law of tonal order within their cosmology, ethics and practice of medicine.2   The sciences studied by the  mathematici included arithmetic, geometry, astronomy and  harmonics; arithmetic was foundational for the other sciences, as Huffman explains:                                                                   2  While it has been suggested that makers of musical instruments were aware of the ratios of     the musical concords, there is no supporting evidence. For objections, see Barker, A., 1989,     p.43, fn. no. 256, and Burkert, W., 1972, p.374.   </p><div id="pagenum"><p>21</p></div><p id="page">13   … while it does have as its own proper object the counting and multiplying and  dividing of objects in the world, it is also involved in each of the other  sciences, insofar as their accounts of the sensible particulars are all given in  terms of numbers, ratios and proportions. (Huffman, 2005, p.65)    Pythagoras wrote nothing himself and his followers obeyed a strict rule not to  divulge the secrets of the tradition; however, the earliest written work of Pythagorean  philosophy entitled On Nature  was written in the late fifth century B.C. by Philolaus  (470-390 B.C.).  Philolaus succeeded Pythagoras by approximately one century, and  while there is no evidence that he conducted experiments in harmonic science (Creese,  2010, pp.104-117) it provided the basis for his cosmogony and cosmology; its  application was solely for understanding the nature of reality (Barker, 2007, p.275).  Of  the eleven fragments considered to be authentic (Frs. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 6a, 7, 13, 16 and  17)3 it has been deduced that while he is not known as a mathematician Philolaus had  an interest in mathematics and demonstrates knowledge of the harmonic ratios  (Huffman, 1993, p.54).  He also wrote on psychology, embryology and medicine.  His  pupil, Archytas (428-350 B.C.), a contemporary and colleague of Plato (Huffman,  2005, pp.32-42), wrote a number of works of which only a few fragments that remain  are interpreted as being genuinely Pre-Socratic, i.e. not being influenced by Plato,  Aristotle or their followers (Burkert, 1972, pp.144-145).4  The Sectio Canonis, a  Pythagorean text attributed to Euclid, dates from the fourth century B.C.   The influence of the Pythagoreans in the ancient world facilitated the  reconceptualization of scientific knowledge, politics, ethics, and hence philosophy.  It  is commonly accepted that Pythagoreanism was important for Plato’s cosmology and                                                                3  The surviving fragments of Philolaus are in H. Diels and W. Kranz, Fragmente der     Vorsokratiker , 6th ed. (Berlin, 1951), I: 398-419.     4  The surviving fragments of Archytas’ work appear in H. Diels and W. Kranz, Fragmente der      Vorsokratiker , 6th ed. (Berlin, 1951).  </p><div id="pagenum"><p>22</p></div><p id="page">14   political theory but was concealed in myths and allegory, a subject that has been of  increasing interest to scholars of Plato.  It is acknowledged that Pythagorean  mathematics and harmonics was influential in key dialogues such as the Republic,  Timaeus, Critias, Statesman and Laws, and the Phaedo incorporates the Pythagorean  concepts of purification, reincarnation or metempsychosis, and the forms as  mathematical entities (Hackforth, 1972, pp.4-6).    The Pythagorean School ebbed away after Plato, and according to Kahn, in the  second and third centuries B.C. the acousmatici  were “replaced as mendicant  philosophers by the Cynics”, and the  mathematici were “absorbed into the Platonic  school of Speusippus, Xenocrates, and Polemon” (Kahn, 2001, p.72).  While  Pythagoras himself became a legendary figure, during this period a corpus of pseudo- Pythagorean texts emerged making it difficult to distinguish truth from fiction;  however, Centrone argues that they all basically articulate the same system (Centrone,  2014, pp.315-340).  Neo-Pythagoreanism originated with Nigidius Figulus who revived Pythagorean  doctrines in Rome in the first century B.C., while Apollonius of Tyana and Moderatus  of Gades spearheaded the revival in Greece.  The trend continued in the second century  A.D. with Nicomachus of Gerasa and Numenius of Apamea who considered  Pythagoreanism to be the influence behind Plato’s concepts of the Good and the  indefinite dyad .  Central to Neo-Pythagorean theory was the concept of the soul and a  desire for mystical union with the divine.                 </p><div id="pagenum"><p>23</p></div><p id="page">15   1.2    The Pythagorean Influence in the Era of Plotinus         Key Neo-Pythagorean concepts appear in the Enneads, and Porphyry, Plotinus’ student,  writes that he was knowledgeable about Neo-Pythagorean philosophy, and even that he  had been accused of plagiarising Numenius, a view that was accepted as wrong  (Porphyry, The Life of Plotinus , 17-18,8).  Porphyry refers to a book written by  Longinus who comments: “Plotinus … has expounded the principles of Pythagorean  and Platonic philosophy more clearly than anyone else before him” (Porphyry, 20, 71- 73).  While Plotinus was highly esteemed in Neo-Pythagorean circles, Huffman  suggests that Plotinus was influenced by “Neo-Pythagorean speculation on first  principles”; however, it was his successors that absorbed Neo-Pythagoreanism into  their philosophy.  Plotinus himself was not Neo-Pythagorean because he considered  Plato to be divine, not Pythagoras who he treats “as just one among many  predecessors” (Huffman, 2014); however, Chapters 3, 4 and 8 will claim that  Pythagoreanism is more strongly implicated in the Enneads than previously  acknowledged.  Stamatellos comments that in the Enneads, Plotinus maintains that his primary  influence was Plato (Stamatellos, 2007, pp.11) and as the instigator of Neoplatonism,  Plotinus presents an innovative development of Platonism in which he also respectfully  acknowledged, and was knowledgeable about, the theories of the Pre-Socratic  philosophers who influenced Plato and Aristotle.  Stamatellos writes: “His thought  assimilates nearly eight centuries of philosophy and intellectual history” (Stamatellos,  2007, p.1), and referring to doxographical material in Ennead VI.8-9 he suggests:    … his intention [is] to show that his philosophical system is not a mere  modernity but an essential continuation of Greek philosophy. … Plotinus aims </p><div id="pagenum"><p>24</p></div><p id="page">16   to prove that the fundamental principles of his metaphysical system were  rooted in Greek philosophical tradition and the teaching of the ancients.  (Stamatellos, 2007, p.28)      Bergson expresses a similar view of Plotinus in a letter dated 31st May 1939 to  Professor Charles Werner, after reading his book on Greek philosophy (Werner, 1938):    …my favorite philosopher has always been Plotinus, who in my eyes  synthesizes all of Greek philosophy and who was also convinced that all Greek  philosophers have said the same thing. ( Correspondances , p.1,626)       While Plotinus’ primary philosophical influence was Plato, the influence of  Pythagoreanism in the wider culture of his era cannot be ignored.  Joost-Gaugier’s  study of the Pythagorean influence on art and architecture indicates that the influence  of Pythagoreanism continued for centuries after the death of Pythagoras.  The sustained  veneration of Pythagoras by his followers is reflected in a consistent tradition of  portraits of him in both Greek and Roman sculpture.  It is held that Pythagoras  worshipped one God, Apollo.  The cult of Apollo was established in Rome as early as  the fourth century B.C., and by late antiquity Pythagoras was regarded as the son of  Apollo and “thus a deity in his own right, meriting not just veneration but something  approaching ritualized worship”, and furthermore, that “it came to be believed that  Pythagoras was the incarnation of Apollo” (Joost-Gaugier, 2007, p.137).  Like  Pythagoras in Greece, Apollo came to be associated with medicine and healing in  Rome.  In Porphyry’s ‘Life of Plotinus’ he states that following Plotinus’ death Apollo  was consulted by Amelius, who desired to know where Plotinus' soul had gone  (Porphyry, 22, 8).  While there is no suggestion that Plotinus worshipped Apollo, or  had any specific religious leanings, Joost-Gaugier notes: </p><div id="pagenum"><p>25</p></div><p id="page">17   Less formidable than he was in Greece, the Roman Apollo thus played a  socially cathartic role in Rome, where he was accepted by all classes of Roman  society. (Joost-Gaugier, 2007, p.152)    The study of harmonics conducted by the Pythagoreans and Aristoxenus5 was  also influential in the fields of Roman architecture and mechanics.  In the first century  B.C. Vitruvius wrote that the architect should know music in order to have a grasp of  harmonic and mathematical relations (Vitruvius, 1914, 1.1.8), and as Walden remarks:  “He immediately focuses on the practical importance of ancient Greek music theory for  architectural and mechanical design” (Walden, 2014, p.126), and “proposes a number  of ways in which the musical-architectural theories he describes can be applied in  everyday architectural practice” (Walden, 2014, p.131).  Porphyry comments that  Plotinus “had a complete knowledge of geometry, arithmetic, mechanics, optics and  music, but he was not disposed to apply himself to detailed research in these subjects”  (Porphyry, The Life of Plotinus , 13, 8-10), so it is not impossible that Plotinus was  familiar with Vitruvius’ work.  The Pythagorean influence was also reflected in Plotinus’ lifestyle.  Porphyry  notes that Plotinus was a vegetarian (Porphyry, The Life of Plotinus , 2.5), lived an  ascetic existence (Porphyry, The Life of Plotinus , 8, 13-24) and placed an importance  on the tradition of silence in his philosophy.  Plotinus was sworn to secrecy about the  teaching of his teacher, Ammonius Saccas (Porphyry, The Life of Plotinus , 3, 24-29),  and he is silent, for example, when discussing the nature of the  One, which is his  version of Plato’s Good.  Plotinus explains that he considers it information not to be  disclosed to the uninitiated:                                                                  5  Chapter 2.3, pp.45-46.  </p><div id="pagenum"><p>26</p></div><p id="page">18   This is the intention of the command given in the mysteries here below not to  disclose to the uninitiated; since the Good is not disclosable, it prohibits the  declaration of the divine to another who has not also himself had the good  fortune to see. ( Ennead VI.9.11, 1-4)    Philosophical tradition is important to Plotinus; hence the concepts of concealment,  secrecy and silence are ubiquitous in the Enneads.  In 1919 Casel referred to the  concept as ‘silentium philosophorum’ (Casel, 1919).  Clark helpfully references  Clement of Alexandria and Eunapius of Sardis as confirmation of the tradition of  secrecy (Clark, 2016, p.xii):    It was not only the Pythagoreans and Plato that concealed many things, but the  Epicureans too say that they have things that may not be uttered, and do not  allow all to peruse those writings.  The Stoics also say that by the first Zeno  things were written which they do not readily allow disciples to read, without  their first giving proof whether or not they are genuine philosophers. And the  disciples of Aristotle say that some of their treatises are esoteric, and others  common and exoteric.  Further, those who instituted the mysteries, being  philosophers, buried their doctrines in myths, so as not to be obvious to all.  (Clement of Alexandria, Stromata, 5.9, in Roberts and Donaldson (eds.), 1867)    …some philosophers hide their esoteric teachings in obscurity, as poets  conceal theirs in myths. (Eunapius 456, in Wright, 1921, p.357)     Plotinus also follows the tradition in considering philosophy to be an initiation  into higher truths; the information is not explicitly given to the student because  initiation is a journey of discovery the student has to undertake for him/herself; the  philosopher is the hierophant, or the one who shows the way.  We therefore find that  Pythagoreanism touched every aspect of Plotinus’ life including his philosophy.     </p><div id="pagenum"><p>27</p></div><p id="page">19   1.3    The Pythagorean Influence in the Era of Bergson        Understanding the Pythagorean influence in Bergson’s era requires a brief history of  developments in the years between Plotinus and Bergson.  The scientific study of the universe ordered according to musical harmonic  principles continued up to the time of Johannes Kepler (1571-1630), who is regarded as  the last genuine Pythagorean scientist (Kahn, 2001, pp.161-171).  This shift was  provoked by religious influences dating back to Galileo (1564-1642), when scientific  research into so-called pagan harmonic philosophies was actively discouraged by the  church.  Pythagorean philosophy and science were driven underground, concealed in  art and architecture, and held within secret societies such as the Freemasons.   Following Kepler, the fact that musical harmony can be expressed in terms of  numerical ratios was still recognised; however, science dismissed the previously held  thinking that the Good, telos, harmony, and musical ratios are cosmological principles  governing all of reality; the focus of science became the physics and mathematics of  acoustics, as noted by Gouk:    By the end of the [17th] century the notion of heavenly harmonies was no  longer popular, having largely given way to acoustical studies based on the  joint development of classical physics and mathematical analysis, and the  harmonies of the heavens had fallen silent. Enlightenment philosophes  themselves certinly claimed to have removed the need for occult principles in  nature. (Gouk, 2006, pp. 228-229)    Despite this important change, music continued to influence and inspire scientific and  mathematical discoveries.  Marin Mersenne (1588-1648) proved the mathematical laws  that pertain to the harmonic series as frequency of oscillation, and the link between  music or sound and geometry was discovered by Ernst Chladni (1756-1827) a German </p><div id="pagenum"><p>28</p></div><p id="page">20   physicist and musician.  In 1787 Chladni published an article entitled ‘Discoveries  Concerning the Theory of Music’ in which he revealed that sound waves naturally  create geometric patterns in matter.  The study of ‘sound made visible’6 uses a  ‘tonoscope’ and is now known as ‘cymatics’ from the Greek κῦμα (wave), so called by  Hans Jenny in 1967.  Cymatics is now considered both as a science and an art.7   Similarly, in 1827 the English physicist Sir Charles Wheatstone (1802-1875) invented a  kaleidophone to make sound waves visible; he referred to it as a "Philosophical Toy"  (Bowers, 2001, p.22).  Music, or more specifically musical harmonics, lost its status as a mathematical  science by the middle of the eighteenth century and was henceforth considered a  performing art by the scientific community; however, those studying music still  considered it a science and an art.  Professor William Crotch, who held the Heather  Chair in Music at Oxford University, quoted Sir William Jones (1746-1794) when  opening his 1831 lectures:    Music … belongs as a science, to an interesting part of natural philosophy,  which, by mathematical deductions …explains the causes and properties of  sound … but, considered as an art, it combines the sounds which philosophy  distinguishes, in such a manner as to gratify our ears, or affect our  imaginations, or by uniting both objects to captivate the fancy while it pleases  the sense, and speaking as it were, the language of nature, to raise  corresponding ideas and  connections in the mind of the hearer.  It then, and  then only, becomes fine art, allied very nearly to poetry, and rhetoric.  (Wollenberg, S., 2006, p.6)                                                                6  This phrase was used by Goethe who in 1817 in "Schicksal der Handschrift". Schriften zur     Morphologie  said of Chladni: “Who will criticize our Chladni, the nation’s crowning jewel?     The world owes him gratitude, since he made sound visible.” (Goethe, 1817, p.51) (My      translation).    7  There are many examples of this on the internet; however, the following is particularly     impressive: Cymatics Experiment:Singing Into a Tonoscope - Mozart Una Donna a Quindici     Anni. 2013.  Available from: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mStM S7Qcf1s.   </p><div id="pagenum"><p>29</p></div><p id="page">21   Advances in the sciences and mathematics during the nineteenth century were highly  significant for Bergson; in fact, in the first pages of Time and Free Will  he  acknowledges them without being specific.  They are however linked to discoveries  regarding the electromagnetic spectrum: in 1800 William Herschel discovered infrared  light; Johann Wilhelm Ritter discovered ultraviolet light in 1801; electromagnetism  was discovered by Hans Christian Ørsted in 1820 and in 1845 Michael Faraday  formulated the field theory of electro-magnetism.; in 1886 the physicist Heinrich Hertz  detected radio waves, and later microwaves; and in 1895 Wilhelm Röntgen discovered  x-ray radiation.  Gamma rays were not discovered until the early twentieth century.   Significant advances in mathematics were made by the French mathematician Joseph  Fourier who discovered that any temporal wave that has a consistent repeating pattern  or continuous function, can be broken down into an infinite sum of simpler sine and  cosine waves with differing amplitudes (Fourier, 1822), and during the 1860’s James  Maxwell developed four partial differential equations for the electromagnetic field, and  predicted an infinite number of frequencies of electromagnetic waves that all travel at  the speed of light (Maxwell, 1865).  These discoveries coincided with advances in the  study of acoustics.  Pesic, in  Music and the Making of Modern Science,  has surveyed  the importance of music in science from the dawn of Pythagorean harmonics to modern  quantum theories, and contends that:   …the Pythagorean theme of harmony remains potent in contemporary physics,  though its harmonies are more and more unhearable, ever more embedded in its  mathematical formalism” (Pesic, 2014, p.5)     He further comments:  music continues to link vibrating bodies and particle physics, for resonance is  the hallmark of musical tone. (Pesic, 2014, p.280)   </p><div id="pagenum"><p>30</p></div><p id="page">22   While Pesic describes how music influenced and inspired scientists and  mathematicians from the Pythagorean era to the present day, in general, science in  Bergson’s day could not be taken to be consciously influenced by Pythagoreanism.   The mathematics of harmonic motion studied by science ignores its musical counterpart  even though, as will be demonstrated in Chapter 2, there is a correspondence between  the harmonics of music and sound; hence the gap between sound studied as a science  and music studied as an art remains.    The new scientific concept of a vibratory universe coincided with a revival of  Pythagoreanism in the wider culture, which included part of the wave of romantic and  ‘traditionalist’ occultism that swept Europe in the nineteenth century as a reaction  against mechanical materialist science.  In the Foreword to The Pythagorean  Sourcebook and Library , Joscelyn Godwin describes how the nineteenth century  “swarms with semi-Pythagoreans” following the publication of Fabre d’ Olivet’s  Golden Verses and commentary in French, Taylor’s Theoretic Arithmetic  in 1816 and  his translation of Iamblichus’s Life of Pythagoras , which in 1818, formed the basis of  Guthrie’s version (Guthrie, 1988, p.13).  In France there was a revival of the occult  aspects of Pythagoreanism and an upsurge in numbers of esoteric societies that were  unconnected with the natural sciences,  and which were founded on Pythagoreanism  and Neoplatonism, including the Theosophical Society, a middle-class spiritualist  movement established by Helena Blavatsky (1831-1891) who aimed for a synthesis of  science, religion and philosophy.  Davis and Taylor propose:    Blavatsky’s writings attempted to reframe the supposedly universal truths of  mysticism in the light of contemporary scientific advances, including  Darwin’s account of evolution and the discovery of the electromagnetic  spectrum, whose “vibrations” provided a ready model for Theosophical  accounts of spiritual energy” (Davis & Taylor, 2017, p.1,390)  </p><div id="pagenum"><p>31</p></div><p id="page">23   Similarly, Bergson claimed that scientific advances supported his theory of duration as  vibrations of energy; hence as Owen remarks:    Bergson’s philosophy spoke to an esoteric understanding of a reality beyond  the purview of “modern Science”, and complemented occultists’ long-held  assertions that scientific materialism was incapable of penetrating the deepest  secrets of the universe. (Owen, 2004, p.137)    The Theosophical Society flourished from roughly 1860 to 1890, and its offshoot, the  Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn, was established in London in 1888 by Dr William  Wynn Westcott (1943-1925), Dr William Robert Woodman (1828-1891) and Samuel  Liddell Mathers (1854-1918), who all had a background in freemasonry that has  historical links to Pythagoreanism.  Samuel Mathers married Bergson’s sister Moina in  the same year, and one of the key practices of the order involved the use of the “will”,  as described by Mary K. Greer:    The student’s goal was to unite the Will with the Highest Self.  Will (with a  capital W) was the consciously focused intention of one’s highest, divine, or  God-like Self, charged by a desire that was purified of all ego-content and  actualized through an imagination that used all the senses but was untainted by  material illusion. (Greer, 1996, p.57)    This goal is influenced by the mysticism of the Pythagoreans and Plotinus who argued  for the mystical union of the soul and the impersonal  One; however, they did not   consider selfhood as medium and goal.  In The Two Sources of Morality and Religion   Bergson utilises concepts of ‘self’ and ‘will’ as applied by the Hermetic Order of the  Golden Dawn, by proposing that the ultimate goal of man is to attain the status of the  mystic who unites his will with the will of God or the élan vital (T.S.M.R., p.99).   Furthermore, Bergson, Theosophy and its offshoots, such as the Hermetic Order of the  Golden Dawn, share the view that the universe undergoes a spiritual evolution or </p><div id="pagenum"><p>32</p></div><p id="page">24   transformation, and it is purposeful evolution as opposed to Darwin who proposed a  materialist purposeless theory of natural selection or adaptation to circumstances.  For  Bergson and Theosophy, the purpose of evolution is to be like God and act with love  towards others.  In The Two Sources of Morality and Religion  Bergson defines the  “great mystic” as:    an individual being, capable of transcending the limitations imposed on the  species by its material nature, thus continuing and extending the divine action.  (T.S.M.R., p.220-221)    Theosophists believe in the Pythagorean theory of reincarnation, and similarly Bergson  is also open to the notion of the survival of the soul after death, if not reincarnation  itself.  Bergson’s philosophy was therefore compared to Theosophy by members of the  Society; his work was reviewed over four editions and included in two volumes of the  Theosophical Quarterly, published in New York between 1913 and 1914.  The review,  authored by John Blake Jr., refers to his work in glowing terms as following the path of  the Theosophist to “the divine nature, to the divine power, to righteousness and to  wisdom and to light”, and significantly he remarks:    he is describing the same effort, the same experience, and his contribution,  therefore, has profound significance for the student of all such searchings after  Divine Wisdom. (Blake, 1913-1914, p.337)     In the second volume of the magazine the author continues his review of Bergson’s  philosophy and states the following:    Some of these ideas, however, are very suggestive of the philosophy advanced  by Madame Blavatsky and often called Theosophy.  It was this that first  attracted the writer to Bergson; and it would be gratifying to think that  Theosophical ideas had so permeated the Western world's atmosphere as the  result of the labors of the Society, that an intuitional philosopher could find </p><div id="pagenum"><p>33</p></div><p id="page">25   them available in his search after the Divine Wisdom. (Blake, 1914 (July),  p.17)    While Blake does not explicitly suggest that Bergson was influenced by Theosophy, a  subtle inference could be read into the quotation above.  The review does however  imply that the popularity of Bergson’s philosophy supported the views of the Society.   To my knowledge, Bergson never accepted nor denied the influence of Theosophy on  him, or the influence of his philosophy on Theosophy.  Following Mathers’ death in 1918, Moina headed a successor organisation, the  ‘Rosicrucian Order of the Alpha et Omega’ (Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn,  2017).   All these orders emphasised the acquisition of secret knowledge derived  through processes of ‘will’, education, and initiation, hence the desire to integrate  science and religious belief.  Bergson’s desire was to integrate science and metaphysics  through the same means of education and initiation.  It is not suggested that Bergson  was personally involved specifically with any of these occult societies; however,  commentators concede that his curiosity about unexplained and hidden knowledge was  an open secret8 and a reflection of contemporary middle-class culture.  Bergson, like his sister, was a member of the Society for Psychical Research  founded in 1882 by Westcott, one of the founders of Golden Dawn, and Bergson  became its president in 1913.  Grogin remarks that Bergson was trying to “validate  esoteric ideas through empirical and rational means.  This was why he rejected the  more extreme forms of the occult in favour of the empirical methods of psychical  research” (Grogin, 1988, p.43).  In his inaugural address as President of the Society he                                                                8   Barnard, 2011, p. 251 and Lefebvre & White, 2012, pp. 297, fn.8 quote Bertrand Méheust,       Who writing about mesmerism in France, in Somnambulisme et médiumnité: Tome 1 et Tome      2, states that Bergson’s interest in the paranormal was an open secret in the society of his       time. </p><div id="pagenum"><p>34</p></div><p id="page">26   suggested that if science had taken the psychological route rather than the  mathematical, the combination of vitalist biology and the science of mind-energy could  be beneficial in medicine:    there would have arisen a medical practice which would have sought to  remedy directly the insufficiencies of the vital force; it would have aimed at  the cause and not the effects, at the centre instead of the periphery; healing by  suggestion or, more generally, by the influence of mind on mind might have  taken forms and proportions of which it is impossible for us to form the least  idea. (“Phantasms of the Living” and “Psychical Research”, in M.E., p.99)    This view of medicine, grounded in the notion of a vibratory universe and underpinned  by sonorous mathematics, was gaining increasing scientific support, and develops the  Pythagorean approach to healing that had a musical basis and was linked to kairos, as  will be explained in Chapter 7.9      The concept of initiation was a preoccupation of every occult organisation,  including the Freemasons, the Theosophists, Hermeticists and others, and a concept  that retained its importance in the twentieth century.  While Bergson was quietly  spoken with an unassuming character, his style of lecturing could be considered an  ‘initiation’ for those who heard him.  In 1913 Arthur Lovejoy described Bergson’s as  “the most Eleusinian of contemporary philosophies” and proposes that Bergson fulfils  the “need for a, new sort of philosophic Eleusinia [that] is recurrent among the  cultivated classes every generation or two” (Lovejoy, 1913, p.254).  According to  Synesius, Aristotle wrote, “Initiates do not need to understand anything; rather, they  undergo an experience and a disposition – become, that is, deserving” (Aristotle,  Synesius, Dio, 10, frag. 15, in, Rice and Stambaugh, 2009, p. 143), and furthermore, in                                                                9  Chapter 7.2, p.218. </p><div id="pagenum"><p>35</p></div><p id="page">27   referring to states of catharsis Aristotle writes: “All who use these rites experience  release mixed with joy” ( Politics 8.7,1342a14, in Burkert 1987, p.19).  Bergson also  proposes that “joy” is attained by his method of intuition (‘Philosophical Intuition’, in  C.M., pp.128-129) and the emotion attained by the mystics who possess supreme good  sense (T.S.M.R., p.220).  If the ultimate aim of Bergson’s philosophy is to experience  the joy of the intuition of duration, he appeared to have achieved it in his writing and  lectures; Le Roy, for example, described the experience of reading Bergson’s  philosophy:    Mr Bergson's readers will undergo at almost every page they read an intense  and singular experience. The curtain drawn between ourselves and reality,  enveloping everything including ourselves in its illusive folds, seems of a  sudden to fall, dissipated by enchantment, and display to the mind depths of  light till then undreamt, in which reality itself, contemplated face to face for the  first time, stands fully revealed. The revelation is overpowering, and once  vouchsafed will never afterwards be forgotten.  (Le Roy, 2005, p.3)     Grogin provides many quotes from those who attended Bergson’s lectures, some of  whom, like LeRoy, described it as an emotional and even religious experience (Grogin,  1988, pp.124-126).  Grogin writes:     He was more poet than orator, a man using a personal charm and magic to take  possession of his listeners. Philosophy in Bergson's hands became something  experienced, and students left his room as if in a dream. (Grogin, 1988, p.42)    Bergson was aware of his impact on his readers and those attending his lectures, and  these accounts of the experience of Bergson’s philosophy can only lead one to conclude  he intentionally continued the ancient tradition of regarding philosophy as an initiation.       Like Plotinus, Bergson was knowledgeable about music, mathematics and  science.  His father was a musician, a composer and teacher of music, holding positions </p><div id="pagenum"><p>36</p></div><p id="page">28   of Professor at the Geneva Conservatory and Head of the London Conservatory; hence  music was in Bergson’s blood.  Before studying philosophy, Bergson completed a  degree in mathematics and would have studied the history of mathematics, including  Pythagorean mathematical science.  It would not be unreasonable to conclude that the  Pythagorean study of harmonics would have been of considerable interest to him due to  his musical and mathematical background, and that he would have understood the  correspondence between the mathematics of music and the mathematics underpinning  the science of the electromagnetic spectrum derived from acoustics.  Furthermore, it  will be argued in Chapter 9 that Bergson’s method of intuition could also have been  influenced by his study of rhetoric, for which he won a prize (Chevalier, 1928, p.43),  and that it has its roots in ancient Greek rhetoric, and the Pythagorean notion of  kairos.10    As for Bergson’s philosophical influences, he acknowledged being influenced by  the philosophical tradition of French Spiritualism, particularly by Maine de Biran and  Ravaisson who proposed a philosophy that opposed materialism and the notion of an  impassive mind, in favour of the view that the empirical sciences could be founded on  the fact that the inner psychological life is active, dynamic and correlated with the  external objective world.  Bergson specifically mentions Plotinus as a positive  influence from ancient philosophy; however, his references to ‘the Ancients’ or Greek  philosophy are usually limited to criticising Plato or Aristotle, and with the obvious  exception of Zeno, he rarely refers specifically to Pre-Socratic philosophy, despite  being fully knowledgeable about the subject.  After reading Charles Werner’s book on  Greek philosophy he wrote to him saying:                                                                    10  Chapter 9.3, p.279. </p><div id="pagenum"><p>37</p></div><p id="page">29   ...  I was particularly struck by your conclusion that Greek philosophy has lost  none of its relevance, being the necessary complement to modern philosophy.   I may surprise you by telling you that I  almost accept this idea, that Greek  philosophy always interested me as much as modern philosophy, and for  several years at the College of France, Plotinus was the subject of my course  and the topic of literal explanation. … What has always attracted me to the  Greek philosophers is the atmosphere they created and which seems to me to  be where philosophy must live; with them, I feel at ease. ( Correspondances ,  p.1,626)    For Bergson, ancient Greek philosophy is not a “mere complement” to modern  philosophy, but a philosophy that has evolved throughout the centuries.  In 1900 as a  Professor at the Collège de France Bergson accepted the Chair of Greek Philosophy,  and as he mentioned in his letter to Charles Werner, he lectured there on Plotinus for  several years.  Prior to that, between 1884 and 1885  he lectured on the history of Greek  Philosophy at the Université de Clermont-Ferrand.  The lecture notes have now been  published by Henri Hude (Hude, 2000).  The timing of these lectures at Clermont- Ferrand coincides with Bergson’s work on his doctorate, awarded in 1889, and for  which he produced two theses: Quid Aristoteles de loco senserit  (On Aristotle's Sense  of Place) (Bergson, H., 1889) and Essai sur les donnés immédiates  de la conscience   (Time and Free Will ) (Bergson, H., 1889).  Pogson, in the ‘Preface’ to Time and Free  Will (his translation of the Essai sur les données immédiates de la conscience )  comments: “The book itself was worked out and written during the years 1883 to 1887”  (T.F.W., Preface, p.v); the overlap is therefore significant.  In Hude’s publication of  Bergson’s lectures on Greek Philosophy he notes that we find many of the central  themes of the Essai in the substance of these lectures:    …firstly we find many of his familiar references.  For example, Bergson made  reference to Évellin’s, Infinity and Quantity , 1881, which he quoted in Time  and Free Will .  His course on Socrates draws heavily upon that of Boutroux on </p><div id="pagenum"><p>38</p></div><p id="page">30   the same subject, and so do his strong references to Zeller.  Furthermore, we  find the core interests, the problems and theories of Bergson's Essai.   The  Ionians are presented as physicists and most of the Presocratics are studied  from the standpoint of the philosophy of science.  The Eleatics are the subject  of special attention (two lessons).  Zeno's arguments are detailed and examined  with the greatest care . (Hude, 2000, p.12)11    What Hude doesn’t mention is that Bergson considered the Pythagoreans superior to  the Ionians and Eleatics, and in his lectures on the Pythagoreans he expressed sympathy  with their number theory and incorporated their key cosmological concepts into his  metaphysics.  This will be explained in Chapter 6.   While Bergson did not adopt an ascetic lifestyle in the vein of the Pythagoreans  or Plotinus, there are noticeable similarities in their method of philosophising, for  example, we find the concept of silence within Bergson’s philosophy in his method of  intuition.  By directing attention within we silence the external world and hence  become aware of the rhythms of duration.  F. L. Pogson, who collaborated with  Bergson in the translation of Time and Free Will,  writes in his ‘Translator’s Preface’:     It is no doubt misleading to attempt to sum up a system of philosophy in a  sentence, but perhaps some part of the spirit of Professor Bergson’s  philosophy may be gathered from the motto which with his permission , I  have prefixed to this translation: "If a man were to inquire of Nature the  reason of her creative activity, and if she were willing to give ear and  answer, she would say – ‘Ask me not, but understand in silence, even as I  am silent and am not wont to speak.’” (T.F.W. p.viii)    Interestingly, Pogson keeps his own silence about acknowledging this quotation comes  from Plotinus, Ennead III.8.4, 1-3.  It is not known whether this was at Bergson’s                                                                11  Appendix 1, p. 2  </p><div id="pagenum"><p>39</p></div><p id="page">31   request or whether it is nothing more than an implicit reference to the similarity  between them.  Ancient philosophy therefore appears to have retained an important place in  Bergson’s life, through his family, his education, the wider culture, where his  philosophy was considered similar to Theosophy, and via his affinity with Plotinus.             Conclusion        Bergson and Plotinus had much in common; they both lived in eras when  Pythagoreanism was experiencing a revival, and while Plotinus believed and  acknowledged he was following Plato in adopting Pythagorean philosophy, Bergson  acknowledges Plotinus as his favourite philosopher, and even that Plotinus is linked  through Plato to Pythagoreanism (T.S.M.R., p.219) without acknowledging any direct  or indirect Pythagorean influence on himself.  The following Chapters will argue that  both philosophers implicitly and intentionally  incorporate Pythagorean concepts into  their respective philosophies: Plotinus more than has previously been accredited to  him, and Bergson whose Pythagorean influence has not been taken seriously and  therefore recognised as significant by modern commentators.  These arguments must  be appreciated alongside the philosophical and historical context presented here.   Chapter two will set the stage by explaining the key Pythagorean concepts that are  implicit in the philosophy of Plotinus and Bergson.         </p><div id="pagenum"><p>40</p></div><p id="page">32   Chapter 2    The Pythagoreans - The Generation of Multiplicity    *      Introduction        Bergson followed Plotinus who was influenced by an understanding of Pythagorean  philosophy that he considered to be a philosophy of transformation in which  multiplicity is generated from an original unity.  This Chapter examines the generation  of multiplicity from a Pythagorean perspective to build a foundation for assessing the  influence of the tradition on Plotinus and Bergson.  It provides an important, but  necessarily brief, introduction to the concepts central to Pythagorean cosmogony and  cosmology, and which will be referred to in subsequent chapters: Nature, the Principles  of Limiting and Unlimited, Harmonia (ἁρμονία), and the function of the Pythagorean  Monad in their number theory.  Much of the evidence comes from Philolaus; however,  we cannot be certain of the extent to which his views are typical of the school.  This is  followed by a brief history of Pythagorean harmonics and number theory, and a basic  introduction to the Pythagorean science of harmonics.  Finally, it will discuss the notion  that since numbers are implicit within the science of harmonics, the Pythagoreans  conceived numbers as powers.                     </p><div id="pagenum"><p>41</p></div><p id="page">33   2.1   Pythagorean Cosmogony and Cosmology        The Pythagorean Philolaus wrote a treatise On Nature (Περὶ φύσεως) that begins as  follows:    Nature in the world-order [ cosmos] was fitted together out of things which are  unlimited and out of things which are limiting, both the world-order as a  whole and everything in it. (Fr. 1,  in Huffman, 1993, p.37)    This opening statement introduces the concept of nature (φύσις) as well as the  principles that underpinned his philosophy: world order (cosmos), fitting together  (harmonia  or ἁρμονία), and things which are limited (ἄπειρα) and limiting  (περαίνοντα).  Kahn (Kahn, 2001, p24) and Mourelatos follow Huffman in translating  “ἄπειρα” and “περαίνοντα” as “limited things” and “limiting things” respectively, and  Mourelatos explains that it is Philolaus’ intention “to classify … all existing things  under these two broad types” (Mourelatos, 2009, p.66).  There is consensus that cosmos  refers to a world that is structurally organised; however, since Philolaus does not  provide definitions in his work, there is considerable debate and little consensus about  the exact meaning of ‘nature’, ‘unlimited’ and ‘limiting’ things, as well as harmonia   with the association of number and musical harmonics.  These concepts and the debate  surrounding them will be examined in the following sections.         2.1.1   Nature (φύσις)        Huffman discusses the various interpretations of ‘nature’ including: “real constitution”  as used by Heraclitus in the Pre-Socratic sense; “growth” that can be activated in  certain contexts (e.g. Empedocles Fr.8); “genesis” and “all that exists”.  Huffman </p><div id="pagenum"><p>42</p></div><p id="page">34   dismisses the interpretation of “all that exists” Burkert (Burkert 1972, pp.250, n.58;  274) and Holwerda (Holwerda, 1955, p.78) as erroneous because it is based on a  presocratic reading of nature that does not account for the fact that Philolaus “specifies  two areas in which Nature is being considered, in the cosmos as a whole and in the case  of individual things in it” (Huffman, 1993, pp.96-97).  Furthermore, Huffman argues  that in Fragment 6 Philolaus states:    Concerning nature and harmony the situation is this: the being of things, which  is eternal, and nature in itself admit of divine and not human knowledge … (Fr.  6, in Huffman, 1993, pp.123-124)    Therefore “nature itself” in F6 is paired with “the being of things” (Huffman, 1993,  p.97).   The view of Viltanioti who refers to Naddaf’s dynamic reading of nature as  growth, is, as we will see in subsequent chapters, more in line with the philosophy of  Plotinus and Bergson:    Phusis must be understood dynamically as the real constitution of a thing as it  is realized from beginning to end with all of its properties. This is the meaning  one finds nearly every time the term phusis is employed in the writings of the  pre-Socratics. It is never employed in the sense of something static , although  the accent may be on either the phusis as origin, the phusis as process, or the  phusis as result. All three, of course, are comprised in the original meaning of  the word phusis. (Naddaf, 2005, p.15)      Viltanioti comments: “The Pre-Socratics conceive φύσις as essentially dynamic or  powerful … realized by a transition to a different status of itself” (Viltanioti, 2012,  p.26).  Philolaus’ claim that nature is produced from the combined action of unlimited,  limiting principles and Harmonia  differs from his Pre-Socratic predecessors, who  explained nature in terms of individual elements or groups of elements such as earth, </p><div id="pagenum"><p>43</p></div><p id="page">35   water, air or fire; however, the interpretation of powers in nature means Philolaus’  concepts may be understood as such and will be examined next.          2.1.2   The Principles of Limiting (ἄπειρα) and Unlimited (περαίνοντα)        In Fragment 6, Philolaus refers to the “pre-existence” of limiters and the unlimited,  emphasising the ontological priority he clearly gives them; not to ‘number’ as stated by  Aristotle in Metaphysics 985b32.  Philolaus’ reference to unlimited and limiting as  “things” in Fragment 1 quoted above, has meant that commentators have disagreed  about their nature, and the table below demonstrates the variety of interpretations:    Author Unlimited Limiter  Boeckh12 Indefinite Dyad The One  Kirk et al.13 Even Numbers Odd Numbers  Burkert14 Empty interstices between atoms Material atoms  Raven15/Guthrie16 A basic principle of number A basic principle of number  Barnes17 Hussey18 Various kinds of ‘stuffs’(matter) Geometrical shapes (form)  Huffman19 A continuum without boundaries Provider of boundaries    Viltanioti’s argument, that Philolaus considered nature as dynamic implies that  unlimited and limiters are powers to act rather than ‘things’ that ‘act’ or ‘things’ that                                                                12  Boeckh, 1819, p.54  13  Kirk, Raven, & Schofield, 1983, p.326  14  Burkert, 1972, pp.258-259  15  Raven, 1981  16  Guthrie, 1962, pp.240  17  Barnes, 1979, p.86  18  Hussey, 1997, p.61   19  Huffman, 1993, pp.37-53 </p><div id="pagenum"><p>44</p></div><p id="page">36   ‘are’.  She proposes that limiters possess the active power to limit and the unlimited  possesses the passive power to be limited; powers “dispose their possessor to be or act  in a specific way” and therefore differ from their bearers; hence “What the “things that  are” do, or can do, depends on the powers they have”, and the powers of limiting and  being limited have varying proportions (Viltanioti, 2012, pp.15-16).    Aristotle ( Metaphysics  986a22), refers to a table of opposites that the  Pythagoreans considered to be principles of reality:    limit unlimited   odd even  unity plurality  right left  male female  rest motion  straight crooked  light darkness  good bad  square oblong    There is no evidence that Philolaus included this table in On Nature , nor does there  appear to be any obvious relationship of the columns to limit and unlimited which  appear at the top, e.g. we cannot assume that odd, male or good are considered as limit.   However, by interpreting limit and unlimited as powers, the other opposites may be  understood as examples of how the principles of limit and unlimited apply to qualities  that have the powers to act either passively or actively on each other in our experience.            </p><div id="pagenum"><p>45</p></div><p id="page">37   2.1.3   Harmonia (ἁρμονία)         Philolaus’ third principle is harmonia , the principle that fits together the limiters and  unlimited:      But since these beginnings [limiting and unlimited] pre-existed and were  neither alike nor even related, it would have been impossible for them to be  ordered, if harmony had not come upon them, in whatever way it came to be.   Like things and related things did not in addition require any harmony, but  things that are unlike and not even related nor of [? the same speed], it is  necessary that such things be bonded together by harmony, if they are going  to be held in an order. (Fr. 6, in Huffman, 1993, p.124)     Barnes notes that the action of harmonia  is a “force”; the active, creating, regulating  force in nature (Barnes, 1979, pp.15-16).          2.1.4   The Pythagorean Monad        The importance of number for the Pythagoreans was represented in their sacred  symbol, the tetractys (Figure 1), which they considered to be “The source and root of  everflowing nature (Burkert, 1972, pp.54-56), hence it represented the generative  nature of reality.  It is also a graphic description of the structural order or numerical  organisation within the nature of sound because it contains the harmonic ratios that  underlie the mathematical harmony of the musical scale: the octave (1:2), the fifth (2:3)  and the fourth (3:4).       </p><div id="pagenum"><p>46</p></div><p id="page">38   Pythagorean Tetractys  (Figure 1)      The sum of the numbers of the tetractys, 1, 2, 3, and 4 is ten, the base of all number,  and according to Aristotle, ten was “considered to be perfect and to embrace the whole  nature of number” ( Metaphysics 986a 8).  Similarly, Stobaeus notes:    The power, efficacy and essence of number is seen in the Decad; it is great, it  realises all its purposes, and it is the cause of all effects.  The power of the  Decad is the principle and guide of all life, divine, celestial, or human into  which it is insinuated; without it everything is unlimited, obscure, and furtive.  (Stobaeus, Eclogae, 1.3.8, (DK 11), in Guthrie, 1988, p.171)    In this fragment the decad appears to have been understood to have a limiting role in the  generation of multiplicity; however, while there is a consensus that the tetractys is early  Pythagorean the importance of the decad is disputed.  Zhmud comments that we cannot  regard Aristotle as representing authentic Pythagorean doctrine; he argues that Aristotle  was influenced by Speusippus’ work “On the Pythagorean Numbers” which was  inspired by Pythagorean arithmology, and:    … it is very likely Speusippus who made a decisive step in the identification of  the early τετρακτtύς with the number ten” (Zhmud, 1998, p.263).     The Stobaeus’ fragment quoted above is also most probably based on a Platonic  interpretation of the tetractys.   There is no current consensus on the exact nature of the Pythagorean Monad due  to a lack of source material and Schibli has comprehensively characterised the debate </p><div id="pagenum"><p>47</p></div><p id="page">39   (Schibli, 1996, pp.114-130).  While Zhmud suggests that Philolaus developed an  epistemological, rather than ontological, theory of number (Zhmud, 1998, pp.256),  Schibli, supported by Schrenk (Schrenk, 1994, pp.171-190), proposes that unity is  generated by a harmonia of the limited and unlimited or odd and even, which conforms  to Philolaus statement that the ‘world order’ was fitted together out of limiters and the  unlimited, dual principles.  Aristotle asserted that the Pythagoreans identified the  limited with the odd, and the unlimited with the even elements of number.  The Monad  or one, the starting point of the number series, is both odd and even because it consists  of both; and number is derived from Unity ( Metaphysics , 986a 17-21).  This view is  supported by Huffman (Huffman, 1993, p.186), and according to Cornford, the tetractys  should be considered as symbolising “the evolution of the many out of the One”,  analogous to earlier “mythic” and “scientific” cosmogonies:    There is (I) an undifferentiated unity. (2) From this unity two opposite powers  are separated out to form the world order. (3) The two opposites unite again to  generate life.    From this explanation, the Monad is the undifferentiated unity of the odd and even and  should not be considered the first number because: “the Monad is prior to, and not a  resultant or product of, the two opposite principles”.  The first even number is 2 and the  first odd number, 3 (Cornford, 1923, pp.2-4).   However, this raises an important  question: Is there a ‘One’ or originating source of the Monad or tetractys that could be  understood as the ultimate source of power from which the powers of the unlimited and  limiting are derived?      In his account of the history of the doctrine of the One between the late fourth  century B.C. and the third century A.D., Dodds proposed that in this scenario the  Monad appears to be duplicated in the dyad: </p><div id="pagenum"><p>48</p></div><p id="page">40    …in Aristotle's references to the Pythagoreans there is no trace of any such  duplication of the One; and the antithesis of the One and the Indeterminate  Dyad is Platonic, not Pythagorean.     Dodds argues that the notion of multiple ‘Ones’ originated in the first century A.D. with  Moderatus of Gades and was based on a Pythagorean interpretation of Plato’s  Parmenides rather than authentic Pythagorean doctrine (Dodds, E.R., 1928, pp.136- 137).20   While the tetractys symbolises the Pythagorean fundamental principle that  embodies a unity that accounts for everything, in Philolaus’ cosmology it is linked with  a central or fire hearth:      The first thing fitted together, the one in the centre of the sphere, is called the  hearth. (Stobaeus, Eclogae, 1.21.8, Fr.7, in Huffman, 1993, p.62)    There is considerable controversy over Aristotle’s interpretation of natural bodies, and  hence ‘the one in the centre’ being a construction ( Metaphysics , 1091a 15).  Huffman  interprets the central fire as “…the one in so far as it is the primeval unity, the  paradigm case of unity in the cosmos” (Huffman, 1993, p.211), while Kahn (Kahn,  2001, p.27) and Schibli (Schibli, pp.119-122) propose that it is the first integer, a view  contested by Huffman because the central fire is “more than a bare monad with  position; it is also fiery and orbited by ten bodies” (Huffman 1993, p.205).  According  to Stobaeus, Philolaus referred to the hearth as “the Guardpost of Zeus, the Mother of  the Gods, the Altar, the Link, and the Measure of Nature” (Stobaeus, Eclogae,  I.22.1,  in Guthrie, 1988, p.170).  None of these terms suggests it to be an original divine  source of unity because in Greek religion Zeus was the supreme deity, the king of the                                                                20 See also: Rist, 1962. </p><div id="pagenum"><p>49</p></div><p id="page">41   gods who, while having a mother (Rhea) and father (Cronus) himself, became known  as the Father of the Gods.  Since Philolaus states that limiting and limiters pre-exist the  one, or ‘the first thing fitted together’, the ‘one’ here, considered the Monad as  symbolised by the tetractys, must be the first rational power source of everything else,  not the highest principle that is beyond being as is the case in Plotinus’ ‘One’.  There  has been a tendency to conflate hearth and fire; however, if hearth is considered a  ‘place’, as Cornford appears to suggest it is in Fragments 146-7 of Empedocles (ca.  495-435 B.C.) (Cornford, 1912, p.229), it is reasonable to consider the hearth to be the  place of fire and the Monad to be the place containing the creative power of the first  unity of the limiting and unlimited, i.e. harmonia .  Simplicius also considers the central  fire in terms of ‘power’:     the more genuine adherents of the school mean by fire at the centre the  creative power which animates the whole earth from the centre and warms  that part of it which has grown cold. (Simplicius, De Caelo  512.9, in Guthrie  1962, p. 290 )    There is no evidence that the Pythagoreans conceived the Monad or numbers as  having a mediating role between the physical world and a transcendent world of first  principles, other than thinking in terms of the powers of the limiting and unlimited.   This appears to be a project developed by Speusippus (410-339 B.C.) and subsequently  Xenocrates (396-314 B.C.), and it was not until the first century B.C. that the  Neopythagoreans, Eudorus of Alexandria and Moderatus of Gades, developed a  henology organised as serial emanations of the divine One.21  Chapter 3 will argue that  Plotinus places the unity of the tetractys or the Pythagorean Monad as a distinct                                                                21  For a detailed history of the historical development of the theory of the Monad, see:  Albertson, 2014, Chapters 1 and 2.   </p><div id="pagenum"><p>50</p></div><p id="page">42   generative power of everything in the universe at the level of ‘Being’, not the One;  hence he follows Plato and his Neo-Pythagorean predecessors in attributing this view to  the earlier Pythagorean tradition.    Having ascertained the Pythagoreans conceived the harmonic ratios of the  musical scale to be unified in the Monad and therefore implicit to the structural order in  the universe22, the following section will briefly explain the concepts of Pythagorean  harmonics and number theory.        2.2   A Brief History of Pythagorean Harmonics and Number Theory        Music has been culturally important for man since pre-historic times.  The oldest  musical instruments found date from around 40,000 B.C. (Higham, T., et al., 2012,  pp.646-676) and Sachs suggests that because “only man is gifted with conscious  rhythm” they evolved as the result of the human motor impulse to add sound to  emotional movements such as dancing, to “express emotion as motion” (Sachs, 1940,  pp.25-26).  Musical instruments were later used in rituals during hunting and religious  ceremonies (Rault, 2000, p.34).  In ancient Greece, music was an integral part of life  and intimately linked to their mythology.  The lyre, aulos (a double piped reed  instrument), and kithara, played by professional musicians, were the three main  instruments, played either alone, or as accompaniment to singing, dancing, or recitation  in religious ceremonies, festivals and sporting contests.  The playing of musical  instruments and the study of musical composition and performance has a long history,  and while Aristoxenus (430 B.C.), in his  Elementa Harmonica,  refers to empirical                                                                22  See p.37.   </p><div id="pagenum"><p>51</p></div><p id="page">43   musical theorists as harmonikoi, he clearly distinguishes their study from Pythagorean  harmonic science as well as his own .23  There is no evidence to support the theoretical  study of harmonics as a science of the tuning of musical scales prior to the  Pythagoreans.  Xenocrates (396-314 B.C.), pupil of Plato and leader of the Academy  after Speusippus, is one of the earliest sources to attribute to Pythagoras the discovery  that musical intervals could be expressed as ratios:    Pythagoras discovered also that the intervals in music do not come into being  apart from number, for they are an interrelation of quantity with quantity.  So  he set out to investigate under what conditions concordant intervals come  about, and discordant ones, and everything well attuned and ill attuned.  (Heinze, 1892, Fr. 87, in Zhmud, 1994, p.291)      The story of how Pythagoras discovered the intervals or ratios of the musical  scale is described in Nicomachus’ Manual of Harmonics (Levin, 1994, pp.83-85), and  reproduced in Iamblichus’ The Life of Pythagoras (Guthrie, 1988, pp.61-65).  As  Pythagoras was passing a blacksmith’s he was moved to investigate musical intervals  on hearing the notes produced by the sounds of differing size hammers striking an  anvil.  He determined the weights of the hammers were responsible for the differences  in the notes and concluded that simple ratios ( logoi) accounted for the concordant  sounds.  While this story has been discredited on technical grounds, Burkert notes that  from the evidence available, only Hippasus can be linked to music theory before  Philolaus (Burkert, 1972, p.295).  This evidence comes from Aristoxenus who claims  Hippasus of Metapontum made four discs of equal diameter but with different  thickness, whose pitches make up the basic intervals of the octave (2:1), fifth (3:2) and  fourth (3:4) (Wehrli, 1967, pp.32-33, fr. 90).  Zhmud, however, comments that:                                                                23  See Barker, 2007, pp.33-67 for a detailed discussion of Aristoxenus’ comments on the       harmonikoi.  </p><div id="pagenum"><p>52</p></div><p id="page">44   Hippasus’ experiment is too complex to be a first attempt … It was conducted  in order to confirm what Pythagoras had already discovered, most likely by  observations and experiments with a stringed instrument” (Zhmud, 1994,  pp.291-2).    While we cannot be certain of the instrument(s) used by Pythagoras, it is known that  later Pythagoreans experimented with the monochord that consisted of a sound box  over which a single string was raised and stretched between fixed bridges [nodes]24 at  either end with a movable bridge between, allowing the string to be divided at any  point and plucked (Creese, 2010, pp.3-4).         With its single string, movable bridge and graduated rule, the monochord  (kanon) straddled the gap between notes and numbers, intervals and ratios,  sense –perception and mathematical reason.  By representing musical sounds  as visible, measurable distances (lengths of string) and by representing  numbers audibly to the musical ear, it offered a way to study music as an  arithmetical science through the medium of geometry. (Creese, 2010, p.vii)     From the end of the fourth century B.C. the theoretical study of harmonics split  into two traditions with differing presumptions, method and purpose: the Pythagorean  tradition and the ‘experiential’ tradition.  Barker helpfully describes the key differences  in their approach and a summary is provided below.        The Pythagorean Tradition         Apart from Pythagoras the three most prominent figures in the Pythagorean tradition in  terms of harmonics were Philolaus, Archytas and Euclid who considered notes as                                                                24  Brackets mine.  </p><div id="pagenum"><p>53</p></div><p id="page">45   entities, the pitch of which: “… varies quantitatively, and can be expressed as  numbers”.  Intervals are taken as ratios, not points on a line measurable as linear  distance.  The method and language of analysis is mathematical, rather than musical.   Mathematics “re-identifies” the notes perceived “as movements in a material medium.   It is to these movements that the quantitative characteristics can be attached directly.”   Number, and especially that of mathematical harmonics, is fundamental for  understanding the rational order inherent in the whole universe, not simply the ordering  principles of musical melody (Barker, 2007, p.8).  Music is considered an expression of  philosophical truth.      The Experiential Tradition     Aristoxenus was a leading figure within the ‘experiential’ tradition.  He was a  practicing musician from Tarentum, southern Italy who travelled to Athens to study  Pythagorean harmonics with Xenophilus before becoming a pupil of Aristotle.  His  Elementa Harmonica  analyses the principles of musical structure inherent in melody  understood through perception rather than the focus on tuning and the formal or  mathematical structure of ratios as advocated by the Pythagoreans, and he does not link  it to physical causes such as the movement of air, rate of vibration or musical ratios.   Notes are considered as linear magnitudes that lie on a continuum of pitch, and the  intervals or distance between them are only referred to in musical terms such as tones  or half-tones etc.  The essential ordering principles are taken from the data perceived by  a “trained musical ear” that listens for melodic sequences (Barker, 2007, p.4).  Aristoxenus is valuable for clarifying aspects of the Pythagorean tradition that  remain open to interpretation because of the scarcity of authentic Pythagorean sources, </p><div id="pagenum"><p>54</p></div><p id="page">46   and as we will later discover in Section 2.4, the science of harmonics as studied by the  Pythagoreans and Aristoxenus includes the concept of ‘power’, which they interpret  differently.           2.3   An Introduction to the Pythagorean  Science of Harmonics           The science of harmonics is complex; therefore, to simplify it as much as possible an  explanation of the basics will assist those unfamiliar with musical concepts.   Pythagorean harmonic science was the study of intervals.  An interval is the  difference in pitch between two notes, i.e., the relationship of the higher note to the  lower note.  They are considered harmonic if two notes are played simultaneously, e.g.  C and G together; and melodic if the notes are played successively, e.g. C then G.    Division of the Monochord (Figure 2)    Figure 2 illustrates how harmonics are generated when dividing the string on a  monochord.  When the undivided string is held between two nodes and plucked it  produces the fundamental note (1:1), also known as unison or the first harmonic.  Dividing the plucked string in two in the ratio 2:1 or 1:2 produces the second harmonic,  an exact replica of the fundamental, but one octave higher (2:1) or lower (1:2).   Dividing the string in thirds, in the ratio 3:2 (ascending scale) or 2:3 (descending scale)  produces the third harmonic, which is known as the fifth  above or below the octave.   </p><div id="pagenum"><p>55</p></div><p id="page">47   Dividing the string into fourths, in the ratio 4:3 (ascending scale) or 3:4 (descending  scale) produces the fourth harmonic, known as the fourth or 2nd octave.  References to  fourths and fifths are musical terms and must not be confused with the fractions 1/4 and  1/5.  The essential point is the three intervals of octave, fourth and fifth are regarded as  concordant and primary, the elements out of which any musical scale or composition is  built (Guthrie, 1988, pp.24-29).  What gives each note its identity is not its pitch or  name, but the relations in which it stands to others in the system.  A Pythagorean  diatonic, (διατονικός) scale, which means ‘progressing through tones’, unfolds  successively in time and is a series of seven notes that divide an octave set out in order  of pitch and the intervals between those pitches.  While musical scales are themselves  melodic, they are also the building blocks of melody.  A melody is a continuous  succession of notes and intervals forming a distinctive sequence that is considered  musical and based upon a structure of attunement and scales considered a priori by the  Pythagoreans.  While the structure is invariable melodies can be infinitely variable.   The fact that we can identify the same melody in different keys (transposition),  demonstrates that melodies are perceived as being made up of intervals rather than of  notes (Trehub, 2014, pp.163-164).  The divisions of the monochord correspond to the physical properties of a string  that when plucked vibrates and produces a series of harmonics as illustrated in Figure  3.  Harmonic Series (Figure 3)      </p><div id="pagenum"><p>56</p></div><p id="page">48   In terms of the physics of acoustics, when a single string is plucked its vibration  naturally produces a series of harmonics or nodes, making a note a compound tone.    First the string vibrates as a unit, then in two parts, then in three parts, four and so on.   These frequencies are integer multiples of the fundamental.  Significantly, these  divisions result in an integrated series, not discrete harmonics, and each overtone  becomes a ‘fundamental’ that has its own harmonic series.  In effect the vibration of the  string generates new nodes or harmonics itself (Gunther, 2012, pp.21-22).  Since the  string represents an indefinite continuum of intervals or tonal flux that may be infinitely  divided, in theory the harmonics are infinite in number.  Placing Figures 2 and 3  together illustrates how harmonics (green nodes) produced geometrically by dividing  the string on a monochord correspond to the harmonics produced dynamically by a  vibrating string (Figure 4).     Geometrical and Dynamic Correspondence of Harmonics (Figure 4)             Division of the Monochord                     Harmonic Series      While today an interval can be determined spatially, i.e. on a musical instrument or  musical score, as continuous by perception, or dynamically as vibrations, it must be  noted that the early Pythagoreans had no way of measuring vibrations accurately and  did not specifically study the harmonics of vibrating strings.  It was not until Euclid  (c.330 B.C.) that the correspondence of physical distance and the musical ratios was  considered in terms of vibrations.  In the Sectio Canonis (Division of the Canon) Euclid  </p><div id="pagenum"><p>57</p></div><p id="page">49   demonstrated the harmonic ratios or intervals have speeds of vibration which are  inversely proportional to the length of string, i.e. a shorter string produces faster  vibrations, and a longer string, slower vibrations.25  This text provides a basis for a  mathematical solution to the subject of physical acoustics and was a development of  Archytas’ incorrect theory (Fragment 1) that provides a physical explanation of pitch in  terms of the speed at which sound travels through the air.  He proposed sound is  dependent on the force of the impact of things in motion, and the speed at which they  are traveling determines the pitch of the sound.  A faster speed produces a higher pitch,  and a slower speed a lower pitch (Huffman, 2005, p.106).    According to Pythagorean harmonics harmonia  refers not to harmony as we  commonly understand it, but to concordant intervals of a musical scale that are ‘fitted  together’ or interlocked according to proportions of an unequal ratio.  Guthrie, quoting  Cornford, explains how this may be interpreted in terms of limit and unlimited:    The whole field of sound, ranging indefinitely in opposite directions - high  and low - represents the unlimited. Limit is imposed on this continuum when  it is divided according to the relevant system of ratios, which reduces the  whole to order, starting from the octave (sc. 1:2, the unit and the first even  number, both of which have their places in the table of archai). ‘The infinite  variety of quality in sound is reduced to order by the exact and simple law of  ratio in quantity. The system so defined still contains the unlimited element in  the blank intervals between the notes; but the unlimited is no longer an  orderless continuum; it is confined within an order, a cosmos, by the  imposition of Limit or Measure’. (Guthrie, 1962, p.248)26                                                                  25  For a comprehensive analysis and discussion, see: Barker, 2007, pp.364-410.    26  See also: Cornford, 1922, p.145.   </p><div id="pagenum"><p>58</p></div><p id="page">50   If Guthrie is right, we could understand Philolaus’ reference to the imposition of limit  on the unlimited as ‘measure’ in terms of the ratios implicated in harmonia .  I return to  Barker’s interpretation of measurement as quoted on page 43: “Notes are considered as  entities, the pitch of which, … varies quantitatively, and can be expressed as numbers”  and that intervals are taken as ratios, not as points on a line that can be measured as  linear distances.  In the Republic Plato states the Pythagoreans, “wasted their time  measuring audible concords and notes against each other” (531a) and they looked “for  numerical relationships in audible concords” (531c).  Pythagorean measurement  therefore focused on relative values of the audible intervals that are expressed as ratios,  not absolute distances between string lengths.  Similarly, the Euclidean Sectio Canonis   refers to ratios of the musical intervals ( diastemata ) themselves.  Whereas the  measurement of absolute distance increases as the distance increases, relative  measurement means that a smaller ratio is attributed to a larger interval.  Having found  a correspondence between interval and ratio when experimenting with different  instruments they concluded that the ratios are inherent in the intervals themselves.  For the Pythagoreans the cosmos consists of ten heavenly bodies, including the  central fire, situated in the centre, and the five planets, sun, moon and Earth in the outer  sphere of the fixed stars.  According to Aristotle ( Metaphysics  986a3) a Counter-Earth  was added to complete the ten of the tetractys.  Kahn remarks while it is not explicit in  Philolaus, the inference is:    …that the periodic motions of these bodies around the central Hearth  somehow instantiate the ratios of musical concord, so that their revolutions  produce the cosmic music of the spheres. (Kahn, 2001, p.26)   </p><div id="pagenum"><p>59</p></div><p id="page">51   Guthrie proposes “they believed the ratios of their relative distances to correspond to  recognized musical intervals … of the diatonic scale” (Guthrie, 1962, p.289).27     If the Pythagorean Monad, the source of multiplicity, is a power generating the  fundamental tone, it has no location on the string itself, ignoring the fixed nodes.  It is  however omnipresent to the multiplicity that is generated in a linear sequence by fixed  locations on the fundamental.  This reasoning was applied to their notion of an unseen  central fire around which the planetary bodies are situated and move according to the  laws of harmonics; however, as Maconie notes there appears to be a “discrepancy” in  the representations:     … contradictions [that] can be interpreted as differences in reference, aural  convention focusing on the omnipresence of the fundamental, whereas visual  convention, interpreting for example the observed motions of heavenly bodies  as the expression of harmonic laws, having to attribute a pivotal location to the  fundamental, while acknowledging the power of the centre to influence the  motions of planetary bodies at a distance. (Maconie, 1997, pp.121-122)    Whether the harmonic laws are interpreted from an aural or visual perspective, power  (dynamis) appears to be implicated in both and is intimately linked to number.         2.4   Number as Dynamis        Before examining how dynamis (δύναμις) and number are intimately linked in the  Pythagorean tradition, it is pertinent to explain how Aristoxenus considers the notion of  dynamis in his experiential theory of harmonics as it was central to his arguments.                                                                27  Huffman, 1993, pp.279-283 notes that no early Pythagorean documents exist that explain  how the musical scale corresponds to the astronomical system. </p><div id="pagenum"><p>60</p></div><p id="page">52   Aristoxenus proposed that melody is capable of being created according to  natural order (Aristoxenus, Elements of Harmonics , 1.24 -2.3), and while he does not  treat harmonics in any metaphysical or cosmological sense, he argued that power  (dynamis) is fundamental for a well attuned melody and that it is encountered both in  perceptual experience and when thinking about it.  Without the power “the attunement  is destroyed” (Aristoxenus, Elements of Harmonics , 1.19).  Barker offers a  comprehensive analysis of Aristoxenus’ concept of dynamis (Barker, 2007, pp.175- 192) and comments: “So far as we know, Aristoxenus was the first theorist to give the  term dynamis a special application in harmonics” (Barker, 2007, p.184).  According to  his interpretation, dynamis refers to notes, not intervals.    [Notes] …have a kind of ‘power’, which determines features of the route that the  voice can take next, and the pattern of relations into which its subsequent  movements can fall. It is not just a fixed point, a pitch, but something with its own  dynamic properties, which (for example) impel the voice to move next, in its  melodious trajectory… (Barker, 2007, p.188)    Levin explains that dynamis is essentially qualitative and implicated in the infinite  continuum and succession within melody; hence “This crucial power is understood by  Aristoxenus to be continuity (συνέχεια)” (Levin, 2009, pp.88).  For Aristoxenus,  continuity arises due to the individual notes that do not move, as well as the intervals  between them in which the voice rises or falls, and he does not consider this motion a  movement of the voice, but a motion determined my natural laws that are implicit in  musical sound (Aristoxenus, Elements of Harmonics , 1.10):    When, however these single units or notes are compounded into scales and  modes in which each is assigned a particular function (dynamis), something  miraculous happens, … a gravitational field of motion is released within the </p><div id="pagenum"><p>61</p></div><p id="page">53   scale, the distinctive characteristics of which are transferred to any melody that  is composed according to the laws of that particular scale. (Levin, 2009, p.112)       Barker comments that Aristoxenus does not explain how the notes as powers could be  integrated within the melody; however, Levin suggests that Aristoxenus does consider  integration in the mind as the creative or generative process of melody.  She refers to it  as an a priori or innate notion of synesis (musical intuition), a combination of aural  perception and mental apperception, and notes that Laloy (Laloy, 1904, p.164)  describes it as "une sorte de kantisme inconscient”, or a Kantian aesthetic (Levin, 1972,  p.229).28  For Aristoxenus, this involves the ability to hear, remember and distinguish:    It is clear that to understand (xynienai) melodies is to follow, with both hearing  and thought (dianoia), the things that are coming into being in respect of all  their distinctions. For melody consists in coming-into-being (genesis), just as do  the other parts of music. Understanding (xynesis) of music arises from two  sources, perception and memory; for one must perceive what is coming into  being, and remember what has come into being. It is not possible to follow the  contents of music in any other way. (Aristoxenus, Elements of Harmonics,  38.27–39.3, in Barker, 2007, p.172)     This quotation bears a remarkable similarity to Bergson’s arguments for perception that  will be examined in Chapter 9.  We cannot be certain that dynamis within the science of harmonics originated  with Aristoxenus; however, it is unlikely if the Pythagoreans considered intervals to be  powers.  It is possible that he merely adopted the concept having learned of it from  Xenophilus and applied it to suit his own theories of melody.  It therefore appears  likely that in the science of harmonics dynamis was ontologically and epistemologically  significant, both for Aristoxenus and the Pythagoreans.                                                                  28 See also Levin, 2009, pp.116-117 and Barker, 2007, p.168-175. </p><div id="pagenum"><p>62</p></div><p id="page">54   Number as the power to connect is the key notion in Pythagorean harmonics, and  as previously mentioned, the ratios represent the intervals between notes, not the notes  themselves.  While there is no written evidence directly referring to the intervals as  dynamis it is reasonable to conclude that they considered the intervals to possess  qualitative powers, just as the qualities in the table of opposites have varying  proportions and can be viewed as examples of how limit and unlimited are powers to  act rather than ‘things’ that ‘act’ or ‘things’ that ‘are’.    The Pythagorean, Philolaus, stated the following:    And indeed all things that are known have number. For it is not possible that  anything whatsoever be understood or known without this. (Fr. 4, in Huffman,  1993, p.172)     Number, indeed, has two proper kinds, odd and even, and a third from both  mixed together, the even-odd. Of each of these two kinds there are many  forms, of which each thing itself gives signs. (Fr. 5, in Huffman, 1993, p.178)    One may speculate that we can have knowledge of things because they give “signs” of  the power inherent in the number itself.  It is possible that Philolaus’ “signs” are  associated with number symbolism as noted by Aristotle, who writes that the  Pythagoreans linked numbers with justice, soul and mind, as well as time ( kairos)  (Metaphysics  985b 29).  Alexander also tells us that the Pythagoreans linked 4 with  justice, 5 was considered a harmonia, a marriage or fitting together of the odd and the  even, the two and the three; and 7 with opportunity ( kairos) (Alexander of Aphrodisias,  Metaphysics  I, 38, 8-18, in Dooley, 1989).   Opportunity is present in the ending of the  old and start of the new, just as the seventh note of an octave marks its end, before the  cycle repeats.  The Pythagoreans did not distinguish between form and matter, causing  Aristotle to ask, “How indeed can qualities white, sweet, hot be numbers?”  (Metaphysics,  1092b 15).  The idea of linking number to qualities is often derided as </p><div id="pagenum"><p>63</p></div><p id="page">55   number mysticism or symbolism; however, it is more understandable if number is  considered in the same vein as the qualities listed in the table of opposites, of which we  understand the meaning.  While dynamis is in the ratios as the unlimited nature of  intervals, the Pythagoreans considered the power of each number to be derived from  the power of the tetractys and to possess meaning, character and the ability to influence  the outcome of events.  Since each of the numbers was perceived to have its own  quality or ‘energy’, not only are we able to sense this power, but number makes it  intelligible for us.  This is possible because there is a correspondence, but not  equivalence, between sensibility and intelligibility.  The Pythagoreans argued the whole cosmos was ordered according to musical  harmony; however, we are unable to hear its music because from birth we become  accustomed to its presence.  We would only become aware of it if it stopped  completely, when confronted with absolute silence (Aristotle, On the Heavens (De  Caelo), 290b).  As noted in Chapter 1, silence and listening were key themes in the  Pythagorean way of life because it promotes the unity of man and God.  According to  Cornford:    It was assumed, moreover, in sharp contradiction to orthodox Olympian  religion, that there was no insuperable gulf between God and the soul, but a  fundamental community of nature. The same order (cosmos) or structural  principle is found on a large scale in the universe and on a small scale in  individuals, i.e. those parts of the universe which are themselves wholes,  namely living things. The living creature (soul and body) is the individual unit  or microcosm; the world, or macrocosm, is likewise a living creature with a  body and soul. Individuals reproduce the whole in miniature; they are not  mere fractions, but analogous parts of the whole which includes them .  (Cornford, 1922, p.142)    </p><div id="pagenum"><p>64</p></div><p id="page">56   While the origin of the term sympathia which means “feeling together” (Preus, 2007,  p.254) is normally associated with the Stoics who referred to it as cosmic sympathy  (Ierodiakonou, 2006, pp.100-101), Pythagorean religious beliefs were founded on the  world-wide primitive idea of universal kinship or sympathy, which in a more or less  refined and rationalised form, permeates its central doctrines of the nature of the  universe and the relationship of its parts.    Through the power of number, harmonia  is the essential principle of unity  forming the basis for any possibility of knowledge.  Through the discovery of harmonic  ratios, “music, as philosophy’s companion, became a bridge between the inner and  outer cosmos, stirring not just the soul but the stars” (Hermann, 2004, p.103).  The  discovery of the harmonic ratios cemented a change of consciousness that had already  begun with Anaximander, a change from a Homeric or mythopoetic consciousness to a  naturalistic consciousness of an ordered world founded on the principle of ratio or  logos, the “principle of proportionality, balance and equilibrium, harmony and concord,  reciprocity and exchange” (Johnstone, 2009, p.81).29    Zhmud argues that the mathematical sciences of astronomy and harmonics form  the basis of Philolaus’ epistemological theory of number:       By the time of Philolaus the exact sciences had repeatedly proved their ability to  be a powerful instrument of cognition which can provide an irrefutable truth  (Zhmud, p.257).    Hence, the Pythagorean science of harmonics was not entirely rational because it  provided a link between mind and matter, or intelligibility and sensibility.  While                                                                29  While logos can be translated as ‘ratio’ it is also interpreted as ‘logic’, and as ‘the  rational/logical/intelligible order of things’.  Ratio is also a Latin root for ‘reason’,  ‘rationality’, etc.  Thus, in the ancient mind, ratio, logic, reason, harmony, and later, the  Platonic ‘good’ are all interconnected.  Interpretations of logos will be examined in more  detail in Chapter 3.4, p.77.  </p><div id="pagenum"><p>65</p></div><p id="page">57   Aristoxenus criticised the Pythagoreans for neglecting the empirical, this was not the  case.  Plato, probably criticising Archytas, who based his science of harmonics on the  tuning practice of musicians (Huffman, 2005, p. 418), acknowledged the Pythagorean  concepts of harmony in music and mathematics; however, he disagreed with them on  hierarchy.  He believed the harmony of mathematics to be superior to the harmony of  music and criticised the Pythagoreans for focusing too much on the actual sound of  musical intervals, and not concentrating enough on the silent harmony of pure numbers  (Republic, 529d and 531c).   The science of harmonics from the perspective of Aristoxenus emphasises the  power that drives the continuous temporal process and generative nature of melody,  which is complemented by  an a priori or innate notion of synesis (musical intuition) in  which sensibility in the form of hearing is combined with memory in the listener or  musician.  Sensibility and intelligibility are also aspects of the Pythagorean generation  of multiplicity; while sensibility is unquantifiable and therefore unintelligible, the  degrees of change when expressed as ratios are intelligible.  Maconie sums it up nicely:     In saying that the universe of things can only be known in terms of degrees of  change, the school of Pythagoras is saying in effect that the universe is only  real in so far as it is subject to change. A dynamic universe is a universe in  motion. The static universe of conventional wisdom is by the same token  unknowable. This is very up-to-date thinking. (Maconie, 1997, pp. 109-110)    Plotinus and Bergson share the Pythagorean view that the static universe as we  normally conceive it is unknowable because it is essentially dynamic; it does not mean  a static universe exists that cannot be known.           </p><div id="pagenum"><p>66</p></div><p id="page">58   Conclusion        This Chapter explained that there is little to provide reliable evidence for Pythagorean  cosmology and cosmogony, and it is interpreted differently by commentators.  It was  proposed that the key concepts in Pythagorean cosmogony and cosmology may be  considered in terms of powers: ‘nature’ is a power that is perpetually realized by a  transition to a different status of itself; the ‘unlimited’ and ‘limiting’ are powers that act  either passively or actively on each other; ‘fitting together’ ( harmonia )  is the active,  creating, regulating force in nature; and ‘cosmos’ refers to the generation of the world  from the Monad, as the power that generates an organised structure of tonal order based  on numbers, ratios and proportions as symbolised by the tetractys.  The Pythagorean  Monad does not appear to be a first principle as we find in the development of  henology in Neo-Pythagoreanism and Neoplatonism, despite their attribution of the  theory to earlier Pythagoreanism.  It was suggested that the nature of Pythagorean  cosmology and cosmogony is reflected in the science of harmonics as conceived by the  Pythagoreans and Aristoxenus in the experiential tradition.  Most important is the  notion of dynamis, understood to be implicit within musical intervals, ratios, and  therefore scales and melody.  It implies a power driving scales and melody in an  orderly fashion and which applies to the dynamic nature of the universe, a universe that  is continuously transforming itself according to the logical structure of the tectractys .   Because music or harmonics forms a bridge between intelligibility and sensibility it has  an epistemological role as well as ontological; the structure is in the world and it can be  understood and sensed.  It will be argued in subsequent Chapters that it underpins the  metaphysics of Plotinus and Bergson; a metaphysics that is supported by modern  physics.  Pythagorean philosophy cannot therefore be subjugated to the interests of </p><div id="pagenum"><p>67</p></div><p id="page">59   historians of philosophy; it is highly significant for the study of metaphysics in general.   Its significance becomes more apparent in the following Chapters as the metaphysics of  Plotinus and Bergson are explained.                                               </p><div id="pagenum"><p>68</p></div><p id="page">60   Chapter 3    Plotinus - The Generation and Nature of Intellect    *      Introduction        The generation of multiplicity in Intellect has proved challenging for scholars of the  Enneads due to perceived ambiguities in the text.  I will argue that if Pythagorean  theories of harmony are taken as heuristics for an interpretation, possible resolutions to  existing aporias become evident.  In employing the model of harmonics, Plotinus  follows in the footsteps of Plato, who in the Timaeus describes how the World Soul  (35a-39e) and cosmos, with a spherical earth at the centre (53c-56c), is built from  substances that the Demiurge combines in ratios which are based on the mathematics of  music, the harmonic series (35b-c).  While Plato is of utmost importance to Plotinus, it  is not possible to address the complex and profound nature of the harmonics present in  Plato’s texts here30; instead, the comparison will be made with the Pythagorean tradition  as explained in Chapter 2.  The Chapter commences with an explanation of Plotinus’ theory of the One as the  first principle of unity and source of multiplicity, which is followed by a summary of  Plotinus’ account of the generation of Being and Intellect as an activity of procession  away from and reversion to the One.  It will be argued, with the help of illustrations,  that Intellect generates itself as a ‘fundamental’ and its content or Beings as an  integrated compound series of harmonics as understood in the physics of sound.                                                                 30  See: Barker, 2007, pp.308-327; Cornford, 1935; Crickmore, 2006; Kennedy, 2011; McClain,      1978; Moro Tornese, 2010, 2017; For a more general account of the role of music in Plato’s      Texts see: Pelosi, 2010. </p><div id="pagenum"><p>69</p></div><p id="page">61   This is followed by clarification of the ontological status of logos as the substance  of the Beings in Intellect, because it is a concept understood to imply a logical ordering  structure that commentators have been unable to define.  It will be argued, based on the  interpretation that Intellect is a fundamental and self-generated harmonics, that the  Plotinian logos should be defined as ‘ratio’, emulating the term used in the Pythagorean  tradition of musical harmonics.  An explanation will then be proposed as to how  substantial number is generated with the primary kinds: motion, rest, otherness and  sameness, the composite of which Plotinus considered an undivided unity within Being  that he models on the Pythagorean tetractys.           3.1 Plotinus’ Principle of Unity – The One (τὸ ἕν)        Plotinus develops a comprehensive theory explaining the physical universe as a  continual process of generation by way of three linked metaphysical, sequential, and  irreducible Hypostases: the One, Intellect and Soul.  The Hypostases have three distinct  functions as: theoretical ontological structures or hierarchical explanatory principles;  paradigms imitated by lower levels and entities; and causes that produce everything  that exists (Gerson, 1994, pp.3-4).  As such they function as dynamic or generative  powers of the One (Ennead VI. 9.3, 45-49 and III.2.1, 22-26).  It will be explained that  Plotinus believed that his theory of the One replicated the early Pythagorean tradition.    For Plotinus, the One is simple, the principle of all things  (Ennead V.2.1, 1-7)  and the first principle of unity.  The One is perfection, indescribable, beyond discursive  thought, logic or knowledge, and as prior to being, it is neither intelligent nor  intelligible (Gerson, 1994, p.14).  The One is not a substance, subject, or a thing that  creates the universe as an intentional act, and while it does not have an external cause </p><div id="pagenum"><p>70</p></div><p id="page">62   since it is cause of itself, it is the efficient and final cause of everything else ( Ennead  VI.8.14, 20-33).  It is the first in the hierarchy because of its infinite and  incomprehensible power that is everywhere ( Ennead VI.9.6), not as a unit or central  point that implies place, spatiality or temporality ( Ennead VI.8.11; VI.9.9, 1), but it is a  paradigm in that individual things in the physical world exist each as a One and  therefore All as a many; hence it is present in all things ( Ennead V.5.9, 33-35).  While  the One possesses all things indistinctly it is “the potency of all things”  (Ennead  V.3.15, 31-33).  Plotinus refers to the Pythagoreans who referred symbolically to the  One as “Aπόλλων” (Apollo, where A = not, pollo = many), i.e., the negation of  plurality (V.5.6, 26-30); however, he asserts it must not be considered a number  because it is prior to number ( Ennead V.1.5, 6-7; V.1.7, 23-24; V.5.4, 17-19).   Schürmann describes the One as an event, function, or the differentiating and co- ordinating principle among things (Schürmann, 2002, p.162).  Plotinus uses metaphors of an ever-flowing spring, a growing tree, ( Ennead  III.8.10, 4-13 or the sun radiating light ( Ennead V.1.6. 28-30) to describe the generative  function of the One whose power continues eternally undiminished while it remains  unmoved itself ( Ennead V.1.6, 18; IV.8.6, 7-16).  Rist remarks that for Plotinus, “…  plurality arises because of the overflowing of the One.  This overflowing is the effect of  infinite power and exists eternally” (Rist, 1965, p.340).  In the act of production its  radiation is a spontaneous generation directed outside to produce something other than  itself that can only be less perfect and less unified.  Cause and effect therefore differ  ontologically.  While the One, as prior, has its own internal infinite power and is  independent and superior, its offspring, Intellect and Soul, are dependent and therefore  inferior; Intellect, because it contains a “a one-many” multiplicity, and Soul, because it  is “one and many”, is dependent on the power of the One via Intellect while being less </p><div id="pagenum"><p>71</p></div><p id="page">63   unified than Intellect.   The hierarchy is therefore not temporal but prioritised according  to Platonic “priority by nature” (O’Meara, 1999, p.72), degrees of power that become  more dependant and less unified at each level.  The One as final causation is explained  in terms of “the actualisation of Intellect” which is the “primary instance of the One’s  causality”.  Intellect exists as inchoate in the One’s radiation or procession, and in its  reversion, Intellect desires the unity of the One; hence the One becomes the Good as  the universal object of desire. (Bussanich, 1988, pp.45-57).  Plotinus’ metaphysics is a  system in which procession and reversion is applied at each Hypostasis to explain the  causal power of the One.  First, the One generates Intellect that acts as the archetype for  individual entities in the world and generates Soul as the third Principle or Hypostasis.   Intellect contemplates, or participates in the One, and Soul contemplates, or participates  in Intellect to express Intellect’s  archetypes.  The One therefore provides an ontological  and epistemological basis for the physical world, since it is both the source of being  and the reason of being ( Ennead VI.8.14, 31-32).   The One also has psychological significance.  For Plotinus, love is the freely  created gift of the One or the Good (Ennead VI, 8, 15; VI, 7, 22) and acts as an  incitement for the soul to love and return to him, to experience absolute simplicity or  unity (Hadot, 1988, p.59).  In his 1914 University of Edinburgh Gifford Lectures  entitled ‘The Problem of Personality’, Bergson stated: “Of all the ancient philosophers,  Plotinus was the only one who was really a psychologist”, and he addresses Plotinus’  psychology of the individual soul and its desire for unity:     He supposed that each of us was multiple “in our lower nature” and single “in  our higher nature.” In other words, he considered a person as a being  essentially one and indivisible, which by a kind of declension or excursion  beyond itself runs down into indefinite multiplicity. Each of us, according to  Plotinus, may experience these two states. In the second, we lean towards </p><div id="pagenum"><p>72</p></div><p id="page">64   division, we materialize ourselves more and more; in the first, on the contrary,  we become more spiritual and tend to a higher and higher unity. That is to say,  the unity of the person tends to coincide with the unity of other persons, and  the person to be one with God Himself.  ( Mélanges , p.1,055)      Plotinus never claimed his account of the One was his invention, and he  acknowledges, without being explicit, it had ancient origins, relying on Plato for  evidence that these views are ancient. ( Ennead V.1.8, 11-14):    … the ancient philosophers who took up positions closest to those of  Pythagoras and his successors (and Pherecydes) held closely to this nature, but  some of them worked out the idea fully in their own writings, others did not do  so in written works, but in unwritten group discussions, or left it altogether  alone. (Ennead V.1.9, 28-34)    The beginning of Ennead V.1.10 reads: “It has been shown that we ought to think that  this is how things are, that there is a One beyond being”, where “beyond being” is  taken from Plato’s Republic 509b, as noted by Dodds (Dodds, 1928, p.136); therefore,  there is no doubt he believed his theory of the One replicated the early Pythagorean  tradition.         3.2   The Generation and Nature of Intellect, the Form of the First Forms        Plotinus provides a metaphorical theory of vision and a psychology of thinking to  account for the generation of Intellect as an act of procession from and reversion to the  One; however, Plotinian scholars have found the subject challenging.  Emilsson  remarks: “all those who have tried to work through the texts, which are several, know  how complex and bewildering the material is” (Emilsson, 2007, p.69).  Plotinus refers  to Intellect as the “Form” of the “first forms” that are vaguely identified with Plato’s </p><div id="pagenum"><p>73</p></div><p id="page">65   Forms, intelligible models or archetypes for things in the sensible world; however more  precision is necessary to clarify the generation and nature of the forms as they are  central for understanding the Enneads.  It will be argued that Plotinus’ metaphorical  theory of vision and psychology of thinking is modelled on the physics of sound, a  model that complements the text and could dispel some of the bewilderment, especially  as it underpins arguments developed later in this chapter as well as chapters four and  eight.      In Ennead III.8.10, 14-19, Plotinus refers to the generation of multiplicity from  the One as a “wondrous act” (thauma) that defies explanation, yet he proceeds to offer  one in Ennead V:     This, we may say, is the first act of generation:  The One, perfect because it  seeks nothing, has nothing, and needs nothing, overflows… and its  superabundance makes something other than itself.  This, when it has come  into being, turns back upon the one and is filled, and becomes Intellect by  looking towards it.  Its halt and turning towards the One constitutes being, its  gaze upon the One, Intellect.  Since it halts and turns towards the one that it  may see, it becomes at once Intellect and being. ( Ennead V.2.1, 8-13)    As noted by Slaveva-Griffin, Plotinus inverts Plato’s account of generation in the  Timaeus.  While Plato adopts a “bottom-up” approach where the universe is built into a  model of perfection by the orderly composition (systasis) of chaotic matter ( Timaeus,  30a and 48b), Plotinus adopts a “top-down” approach, where multiplicity is the orderly  expression of a prior cause and is ultimately ‘otherness’, a standing away, standing  apart, or separation ( apostasis) of multiplicity from the One and is its radiation ( Ennead  V1.6.1, 1).  Slaveva-Griffin notes that Plotinus’ concept of apostasis has its roots in the </p><div id="pagenum"><p>74</p></div><p id="page">66   philosophy of the Neopythagoreans, especially Numenius under the influence of the  Timaeus (Slaveva-Griffin, 2009, pp. 24-25).31    Plotinus argues that the first separation from the One involves movement and  otherness:     …Movement too was called otherness because Movement and Otherness  sprang forth together.  The Movement and Otherness which came from the  First are undefined, and need the First to define them; and they are defined  when they turn to it.  (Ennead II.4.5, 30-34)    Following Aristotle’s characterisation of Plato’s account of matter ( Physics 187a17),  Plotinus refers to the indefinite dyad as movement and otherness ( Ennead V.I.5, 6-9),  which he describes in the above quotation as “undefined” and in Ennead V.3.11, 5 as  “sight not yet seeing”.  It must not be considered a multiplicity because, as Rist  remarks, “The expression 'otherness' is common throughout the Enneads and its aspect  of unlimitedness must be pressed so that it may be seen to mean 'neither simple nor  multiform'” (Rist, 1962, pp.99-100).    In the next stage of the process, the movement away from the One halts and turns  towards the One because it has an innate desire for the unity of the  One, which is the   Good.  As Emilsson explains, being ‘other’ than the  One it is not completely self- sufficient.  For Plotinus, “the Good is the telos of everything but pre-eminently it is the  telos of its first product, the inchoate intellect” (Emilsson, 2007, p.72); however, it  cannot ‘think’ it lacks something because it is not yet an Intellect that thinks.  Just as  vision requires a subject that sees and an object that is seen, thinking requires a thinker  and an object of thought ( Ennead V.3.10).                                                                  31  In Chapter 1 Slaveva-Griffin provides a comprehensive account of how Plotinus’ cosmology      inverts Plato’s cosmogony, with Neo-Pythagoreanism acting as intermediary.   </p><div id="pagenum"><p>75</p></div><p id="page">67   In Ennead V.2.1, 8-13, quoted above, Plotinus states: “Its halt and turning  towards the One constitutes being”, and in Ennead V.1.4, 27-29, that Intellect makes  Being exist in thinking it, and Being gives thinking and existence to Intellect by being  thought.  Like Plato, Plotinus gives ontological priority to the primary kinds: Otherness,  Sameness, Motion, Rest and Being.32     For there could not be thinking without otherness, and also sameness. …But  one also must include Motion and Rest.  One must include movement if there is  thought, and rest that it may think the same: and otherness, that there may be  thinker and thought… But one must include sameness, because it is one with  itself, and all have a common unity; and the distinctive quality of each is  otherness. ( Ennead V.1.4, 33-41)    Plotinus refers to the primary kinds as the principles in Being from which everything  else comes ( Ennead V.1.4, 44), and as he does not include Intellect as one of the  primary kinds ( Ennead VI.2.18, 12-14), the passage above suggests they precede the  thinking Intellect, not as distinct kinds but unified in Being.  This is confirmed in  Ennead VI.6.8, 16-19 where Plotinus proposes that Being and Intellect are  “simultaneous and exist together”; but Being precedes Intellect; so, this only makes  sense if Being is present in inchoate Intellect.  It was noted motion and otherness were  indefinite in the radiation from the One; however, for Plotinus, rest is also present  because it is the “defining limit of Intellect” due to the halt and turn, while “ Intellect is  the movement of the Form” ( Ennead VI.2.8, 22-24).  Sameness arises because motion,  otherness and rest are the same in Being (Ennead VI.2.8) and are therefore undefined in  Being.33  The precedence of Being in the generative process must not be considered                                                                32  Plato, Sophist 254 Dff.    33  This will be discussed further in Section 3.5, p.85 which examines the link between Being  and numbers.   </p><div id="pagenum"><p>76</p></div><p id="page">68   temporal but a priority of nature, as it is an intelligible reality concerning universal truth  and is therefore unchanging.34  The opposites in Being represent the indefinite nature of  the dyad that must be understood in terms of unlimited and limited:    One will conceive it as the opposites and at the same time not the opposites:  for one will conceive it as great and small – for it becomes both – and at rest  and moving- for it really does become these.  … before becoming them it is  neither definitely: otherwise, you have limited it [or defined] it. ( Ennead VI. 6.  3, 28-34)35    While Plotinus followed Plato in adopting the primary kinds, the notion of opposites in  terms of unlimited and limited originates with Philolaus who, as explained in Chapter  2, gives ontological priority to limiters and the unlimited by referring to their “pre- existence” in Fragment 6.36   The final stage is the gaze upon the One arising from desire for the Good; “desire  generates thought”  (Ennead V.6.5, 9-10).  Plotinus refers to the reversion or “gaze” as a  “touching and a sort of contact” and “coincidence” with the One (Ennead V.3.10, 43);  it is this contact that defines Intellect and gives existence to  Being.    The puzzling feature of Plotinus’ account is why the radiation from the One halts  and turns back to it .  Emilsson comments, Plotinus “entirely fails to explain the  conversion.  There is certainly nothing in the emission of light or heat, or the flowing of                                                                  34  For Plotinus, the objects of intellectual cognition are eternal truths, whereas the objects of  perceptual cognition are perceived one after another in temporal succession.  See Ennead III.  7, ‘On Eternity and Time’.    35  Armstrong comments ( Ennead VI.6-9, p.17) according to Aristotle, “Plato spoke of the  indefinite principle of multiplicity as a dyad “great and small””.  See references to Physics  203a15-16 and Metaphysics  A6. 987b 26.      36  Chapter 2.1.2, p.82.   </p><div id="pagenum"><p>77</p></div><p id="page">69   liquids, that provides a reason for a conversion of the efflux”.  He refers to the lack of  explanation as a “gap between the procession and the conversion”, proposing the return  is required for a psychological theory based on a desire for the Good, and that Plotinus’  metaphorical use of vision constitutes the difference between subject (inchoate Intellect)  and its object (the One) (Emilsson, 2007, pp.70-78).  It is true that Plotinus does not  explain why the reversion is necessary; however, since reversion is a natural part of the  process of generation of harmonics, and complements his account, it is suggested that  this is the model Plotinus had in mind.    To understand how the generation of Intellect conforms to the generation of  harmonics, let us return to Figures 2 and 3 in Chapter 2.37  Figure 2 illustrates the  musical harmonics produced by dividing the string on a monochord; however, let us  first consider the monochord itself which is basically a simple instrument consisting of  a single string held in equilibrium between two stationary nodes.  The apparatus is set,  now for the physics.  Figure 5 illustrates that as energy travels through the string held  between two nodes it causes a displacement from equilibrium, and the maximum point  of displacement is referred to as an anti-node .  On reaching the second stationary node  the energy is reflected back to the first node, creating a second anti-node , thus forming  a standing wave and creating a fundamental  tone which is known as unison (Gunther,  2012, p.15).                                                                37  Chapter 2.3, p.46 and p.47 respectively. </p><div id="pagenum"><p>78</p></div><p id="page">70   Creation of the Fundamental (Figure 5)     This serves as a model for Plotinus’ account of procession and reversion that is  illustrated in Figures 6 and 7.  Let us take Node 1 on the left to represent the One  because Plotinus regards the One or Good as a stationary power source; Plotinus is clear  that the One does not move and refers to it as being formless itself but providing a  “base” for Intellect “… the “Form” of the first “Forms” ( Ennead VI.7.17, 35-36).  The arrow pointing to the right represents the energy radiating from the One in  the form of the indefinite dyad (motion and otherness), and whereas Plotinus applies a  metaphor of light to the One, the indefinite dyad is in darkness or “unilluminated from  the First” ( Ennead II.4.5, 34-35).  The idea that darkness is prior to light is exemplified  in Hesiod’s Theogeny  [116–125] where Nyx, Goddess of the Night, daughter of Chaos,  was one of the ancient Protogenoi, the first-born elemental gods, and who together with  Erebos (Darkness) gave birth to Hermera (Day).  Similarly, in ancient religious  cosmology such as that found in versions of Hinduism, Buddhism as well as  Christianity, priority is given to the primeval ‘sound’ of creation, with the first creation  described in terms of light.  This is epitomised in the Bible, where the voice or sound of  God created light; for example, in Genesis 1: “And God said, “Let there be light,” and  in John 1.1: “In the beginning was the Word, & the Word was with God, and the Word  was God” (King James Bible, 1611).    </p><div id="pagenum"><p>79</p></div><p id="page">71   Node 2 represents the point at which the procession halts and turns, and according  to Plotinus, “Its halt and turning towards the One constitutes being”.    Procession and the Creation of Being (Figure 6)      The indefinite dyad, in its movement away from the One becomes limited by resting  (Bussanich, 1988, p.15), since he states that “rest is the limit of intellect” ( Ennead  VI.2.8. 18-24); though at this stage Being remains indefinite, and potentially the  principle that unifies the primary kinds, motion, rest, same and other.  Plotinus refers to  it as “primary being” and an “image of the One”, both within the context of sound:    And if someone says that this word einai [being] - which is the term which  signifies substantial existence – has been derived from the word hen [one] he  might have hit upon the truth. For this which we call primary being proceeded,  so to speak, a little way from the One, but did not wish to go still further, but  turned inwards and took its stand [ estē] there, and became substance [ ousia]  and hearth [ hestia] of all things;  it is like what happens in the utterance of the  sound; when the utterer presses on it hen is produced which manifests the  origin of the One and on [being] signifying that which came to exist, substance  and being, has an image of the One since it flows from its power. ( Ennead  V.5.5, 12-23)    Plotinus appears to conceive rest as a sense of place when he uses the Pythagorean  notion of “hearth” (Hestia), which is a fitting metaphor for ‘node’ in the generation of  </p><div id="pagenum"><p>80</p></div><p id="page">72   harmonics38; however, he did not consider ‘hearth’ in a spatially extended context  because Intellect is self-inclusive in that it contains internal differences, and it’s eternal,  non-discursive nature means that it is neither in space nor time.  Plotinus refers to  eternity as “the life which exists around being, all together and full, completely without  extension” ( Ennead III. 7. 3, 36-38)39 while Emilsson refers to Intellect as having  “Intellectual space” (Emilsson, 2007, p. 51) that can be interpreted as the intellectual  substantial “place” of internal difference.    For Plotinus, the One (Node 1) and rest as Being (Node 2), are essential for  providing the shape of the form of Intellect:    Being must not fluctuate, so to speak, in the indefinite, but must be fixed by limit  and stability; and stability in the intelligible world is limitation and shape, and it  is by these that it receives its existence. ( Ennead V.1.7, 24-28)     The Form of Intellect (Figure 7) is completed on its reversion or gaze which is  represented by the arrow pointing towards the One and its coincidence with the One  (Node 1).                                                                 38  Plotinus refers to Being as a “hearth” again in Ennead VI.2.8, 8.  39  See also: Ennead IV.3.5, 23-30. </p><div id="pagenum"><p>81</p></div><p id="page">73   Creation of the Form of Intellect (Figure 7)   This accounts for why Plotinus refers to the gaze as “touching and a sort of contact”, as  without it the form would not be completely bound:    For immediately by looking to something which is one the life is limited by it,  and has in itself limit and bound and form; and the form was in that which was  shaped, but the shaper was shapeless. But the boundary is not from outside, as  if it was surrounded by a largeness, but it was a bounding limit of all that life  would be which shines out from it. ( Ennead VI. 7, 17, 15-22)    In Plotinus’ account of procession and reversion, he insists the Form of Intellect has a  shape and boundary; there is no shapeless straight line of procession and reversion  between the One and Being.  If we interpret his account from the perspective of sound,  anti-nodes occur naturally between Nodes 1 and 2 in the procession and reversion,  generating the shape and boundary of the ‘fundamental’ or first harmonic that nicely  complements his description.     Plotinus explains that while Intellect is defined as one, it includes a multiplicity  within its boundary which will be interpreted as an integrated compound series  consisting of the form of Intellect as a fundamental and its Beings as self-generated  harmonics.    </p><div id="pagenum"><p>82</p></div><p id="page">74   3.3   The Generation of Intellect as Being and Beings        Continuing the process from the previous section, will demonstrate how Plotinus  followed the Pythagoreans who considered musical harmonics to be the a priori  structure for the generation of, and order in, the universe.    On contact with the One the primary kinds in Being that were undefined and  potential, become defined and actual because they are thought by Intellect as many; it  becomes “seeing sight” when it receives the light or power of the One (Ennead V.3.11,  8-13).40  Aristotle proposed in De anima  (419a 10-22) that vision requires a medium for  visual contact because an object cannot be seen if it comes directly into contact with the  eye, and similarly, Plotinus proposes that on contact with the One, Intellect does not see  it.  As it is unable to grasp it in its full power it reverts to itself, dividing the One’s  power into a multiplicity ( Ennead V1.7.15, 20-24);41 hence Intellect becomes conscious  of its own existence or Being, and as the “primary knower” ( Ennead V.3.12, 47) it turns  to itself for knowledge of the One and in doing so generates itself:    Intellect, certainly, by its own means even defines its being for itself by the  power which comes from the One, …But Intellect sees, by means of itself, like  something divided proceeding from the undivided, that life and thought and all  things come from the One. ( Ennead V.1.7, 13-19)    Intellect now has a ‘life’ (ζωή) in thinking the actuality of Being, motion, rest sameness  and otherness.  Plotinus states that Intellect’s knowledge of the many in itself is                                                                40  See also Ennead VI.7.16, 20-23.    41  Lloyd and Bussanich, disagree about the One’s role in the generation of Intellect.           See: Lloyd, 1987 and Bussanich, 1988.   Their arguments are discussed in Emilsson, 2007,  p.75.  See also Slaveva-Griffin, 2009, p.50, for her interpretation that multiplicity is the  flowing or radiation of the One.      </p><div id="pagenum"><p>83</p></div><p id="page">75   immediate, so we certainly cannot consider them to be “premises” or “axioms” or  “expressions”, as Intellect would have to place the objects of thought outside itself  (Ennead V. 5. 1, 40-43).  Intellect is ontologically and epistemologically unified  simultaneously as subject and object, knower and known, i.e. it knows itself as content  and thinker of its content, and yet its thoughts are determined by the One (Emilsson,  2007, pp. 4-5).    Once again this can be understood as harmonic motion.  Having created the  fundamental  as a result of energy being reflected from the second node back to the first  node, the first node continues the movement by reflecting the energy back to the  second, again producing anti-nodes or displacements in the mode of oscillation (Figure  8).  Harmonic Motion (Figure 8)        The movement illustrated in Figure 8 is replicated in Plotinus’ account of Intellect  seeing and knowing itself as Being when Being is illuminated by the One.  Intellect   turns away from the One and to itself (Figure 9).          </p><div id="pagenum"><p>84</p></div><p id="page">76   Intellect’s Return to Itself (Figure 9)       Returning to harmonic motion, the second node reflects the energy back again,  hence a further displacement and the creation of a third node and the second harmonic  where the waveforms cross, half-way between the two nodes.  Because the waves are  travelling in different directions at the same speed they cancel each other out and there  is hardly any motion at this point.  The movement continues and produces a further anti- node (Figure 10).  These shorter wavelengths correspond to a vibration with twice the  frequency of the fundamental frequency42 and which constitutes the first overtone, or a  difference of an octave in music.    Generation of the Second Harmonic (Figure 10)                                                                     42  The harmonic is a multiple of the fundamental frequency.  </p><div id="pagenum"><p>85</p></div><p id="page">77   This is replicated in Plotinus’ account of the generation of Soul, the first being ( Ennead  V.2.1, 15-16).  When Intellect turns to itself its desire for the Good makes it return to  the One, generating Soul as the third stationary node and second harmonic as a principle  of limit (Figure 11).    The Generation of Soul (Figure 11)      If we think of it in terms of music Soul is the same note as Intellect but with a difference  of one octave, and significantly, it is an instance of the primary kinds in action.    Subsequent harmonics are produced because energy continues to be reflected by  the nodes, and further displacements in the mode of oscillation produces additional  nodes or harmonics together with their corresponding partials at 1/3, 1/4, 1/5 etc., of the  string's fundamental wavelength (Gunther, 2012, pp.20-21).43  The shorter wavelengths  correspond to harmonics at frequencies that are 3, 4, 5, etc., times the fundamental  frequency.  Figure 12 illustrates how a limited number of multiple harmonics are  generated, using different colours to emphasise the harmonics.  It is a natural process of  generation that theoretically continues to infinity, and which in mathematics is known  as a slowly diverging series.  Furthermore, each harmonic becomes a fundamental in its                                                                43  See illustration 2.6a.   </p><div id="pagenum"><p>86</p></div><p id="page">78   own right, generating its own harmonics or nodes in the same manner as the  fundamental from which it was generated.    Generation of Multiple Harmonics (Figure 12)      With these features of harmonic generation in mind, let us consider what Plotinus  tells us about the nature of Intellect.  He describes Intellect as a substantial ( Ennead  II.6.1, 6-9) one-many, a unified multiplicity, a ‘Complete Living Being’ ( Enneads  VI.6.8, 1-4; V.9.9, 4-9; VI.7.8, 30-32) whose parts are self-generated ( Ennead III.7.4,  10).  Its offspring is a multiplicity of Beings which are all different forms of itself and  are therefore all individual intellects which are bounded by Intellect; it thinks and keeps  them within itself ( Ennead VI.7.17, 26-28).  This one-many does not consist of discrete  parts, they interpenetrate44 just as harmonics are self-generated as an integrated  compound series when the pulse of energy is carried along the string between two  nodes.  While Intellect is the first form and has a shape, the Beings themselves also  have shapes or forms that Plotinus refers to as intelligible matter ( Ennead II.4.3, 15- 17):    But if intelligible reality is at once many and partless, then the many existing  in one are in matter which is that one, and they are its shapes: conceive this  unity as varied and of many shapes. ( Ennead II.4.4, 14-17)                                                                44  Armstrong, 2013, p.40 and p.50.    </p><div id="pagenum"><p>87</p></div><p id="page">79   While Plotinus explains that the shapes in Intellect are not the same as those  experienced in the sensible world, he refers to the movement of Intellect as a  “wandering in itself” ( Ennead VI.7.13, 30-31).  He is not explicit about what he means  by shapes in Intellect other than describing Intellect as an “outline” that holds “outlines  inside itself”, and furthermore, that “its division does not go on in a straight line but  moves always to the interior” ( Ennead VI.7.14, 13-17).  It is therefore suggested that  the shapes to which he refers are the shapes generated as varying wavelengths are  created with the production of nodes and anti-nodes, and which constitute Intellect’s  ‘life’ (ζωή).  Plotinus describes Intellect as “boiling over with life” ( Ennead VI.5.12,  9), a metaphor that accurately describes the bubbling appearance as waves are  generated by the vibrations and harmonics in the fundamental, as illustrated in Figure  12.  He also considers Intellect and the generated intellects or forms to be an infinite  process of division ( Ennead VI.7.13, 5-8).  The fractalisation of Intellect is consistent  with the mechanism of harmonic generation.  If the first being generated by Intellect is  Soul considered as the third stationary node, (Figure 11), all the other realities follow as  forms which are underpinned by the generation of nodes as substance.  Each partial  becomes a fundamental in its own right generating an infinite series of harmonics each  of which follows the same physical law as the fundamental.  Stamatellos comments:  “…every intelligible within the realm of intellect is actually itself, “but potentially all  the others” (Stamatellos, 2007, p.62).  Similarly, Plotinus describes Intellect as the  principle of necessity ( Ennead V.3.6, 10-11) operating as a “law of being” by which  Beings are generated ( Ennead V.9.5, 26-29).45  This is similar to the Pythagoreans who  considered musical harmonics to be the a priori structure for the generation of, and  order in, the universe.  Furthermore, just as the physical laws of harmonics are                                                                45  This will be examined in detail in Section 3.5, p.89. </p><div id="pagenum"><p>88</p></div><p id="page">80   considered unchanging, Plotinus considers Intellect to be unchanging and eternal,  “…for “eternity” is derived from “‘always existing” ( Ennead III.7.4, 43-44), hence the  generation of Intellect is non-spatial and non-temporal because Intellect and its content  undergo no change ( Ennead II. 4. 5, 26-27; Ennead V. 9. 5, 33-35).  While in Plotinus’  day there would be no means of measuring the time taken for a pulse of energy to travel  through a string, modern technology has now made it possible. On a musical instrument  it occurs in a measurement of milliseconds (Gunther, 2012, pp.11-12), a speed that we  are unable to perceive as a temporal process, hence all the harmonics of a tone or sound  are perceived simultaneously.  It is therefore reasonable to assume that Plotinus also  considered the harmonics of Intellect to be generated simultaneously, thus partially  contributing to his argument that it lacks temporality.  The harmonics model could understandably be rejected on the view that the  physics of standing waves was not understood in Plotinus’ day.  It is true that  references to standing waves and nodes were a much later discovery by Robert Hooke  (1635-1703) and Joseph Sauveur (1653-1716).  Sauveur was the first to use the terms  fundamental frequency , and harmonics  for higher frequencies that are determined by  nodes for points of rest and loops for motion (Rao, 2007, p.7), while the discovery of  standing waves is attributed to Faraday, who in 1831 observed standing waves on the  surface of a liquid in a vibrating container.  Plotinus would not have been familiar with  the terms nodes and antinodes; however, the phenomenon is, easily observed when  energy travels through a rope, an example commonly used in modern school textbooks.   It is conceivable that it was understood by Plotinus because the theory of sound as a  mechanical wave predated him.  Euclid linked harmonics to vibrations, though not as  standing waves specifically, and Freely comments: “The Stoics were the first to use the </p><div id="pagenum"><p>89</p></div><p id="page">81   analogy of water waves to explain the propagation of sound”, referring to a quotation  from Aetius:    The Stoics say that air is not composed of particles, but that it is a continuum  which contains no empty spaces.  If it is struck by an impulse it rises in circular  waves proceeding in a straight sequence to infinity, until all the surrounding air is  stirred, just as a pool is stirred by a stone which strikes it.  But whereas in the latter  case the motion is circular, the air moves spherically. (Freely, 2012, p.75)    Kilgour writes in his ‘Vitruvius and the Early History of Wave Theory’, that the Stoics,  Vitruvius (Vitruvius, 1914, V.4) and Boethius (A.D. 480-524) (De Musica, Book I,  chapter 14) considered sound a transverse wave, as when a stone is thrown into water  the ripples expand outward and waves form perpendicular to the trajectory, a theory  that persisted until the sevententh century when it was superseded by longitudinal wave  theory.  Since Porphyry confirms that Plotinus was knowledgeable about mechanics it  is possible that this is how he understood the vibrations of sound and explains why in  Ennead 1.8.2 he refers to Intellect living around the One and Soul circling around  Intellect, while the One remains unmoved in the centre.  Vitruvius also, compares  sound to waves in water, which when obstructed flows back and breaks up the  subsequent waves, and as Kilgour comments: “Vitruvius shows that wave theory  accounts for interference and reflection, to use modern terms-in his phrases, dissonance  and echo” (Kilgour, 1963, p.284-285).  Nicomachus (c. 60-120 A.D.), in Chapter 10 of  his Manual of Harmonics  specifically refers to the inverse proportion obtaining  between the length of string on a canon and its vibration when the string is plucked,  such that if the pitch is increased one octave, the string is half as long and is vibrating  twice as fast, and if the pitch is increased by a fifth, the string is 2/3rds as long and is  vibrating 3/2 as fast, and if the pitch is increased by a fourth, the string is 3/4ths as long  and is vibration 4/3rds as fast (Levin, 1994, pp.141-146).  It could therefore be argued </p><div id="pagenum"><p>90</p></div><p id="page">82   that Nicomachus had already made the connection between harmonic ratios and the rate  of vibration; hence the logic behind procession and reversion forming waves as  vibrations and harmonics.  It is contended that Chapters 4 and 8 will support the  argument and that it cannot be dismissed because Plotinus could not have understood  the concept.   Plotinus appears to have understood the generation of harmonics from the  fundamental to be a natural physical law and applied it in metaphysical terms, which  indicates an important development of Pythagorean philosophy.  The argument that  Plotinus used the generation of harmonics as a model is strengthened if we consider  what he says about intelligible matter and its link to number. Both are implicated with  the concept of logos that will be explored next.         3.4   Intelligible Matter, Logos (λόγος) and Substance in the Enneads        Plotinus claims that the universe is generated according to the law within Intellect  which is logos, a concept central to his metaphysics and which commentators rightly,  but vaguely, interpret as ‘rational forming principle’ or ‘reason principle’.  The aim of  this section is to propose a precise understanding that is compatible with the model of  harmonics.   For Plotinus there is a distinction between intelligible matter and physical  matter.  Physical matter generates nothing because it is powerless, always receiving  different forms one after another, and therefore constantly changing because “one thing  pushes out another” ( Ennead II.4.3, 9-17).  The composite of intelligible matter is logoi  or forming principles whose actuality makes form that is always the same but shaped in  a different way, and it is all things at once, unchanging and eternal.  Whereas the matter </p><div id="pagenum"><p>91</p></div><p id="page">83   of the world of sense is dead, intelligible matter is living ( Ennead II.4.5, 15-19).   Plotinus describes the nature of intelligible matter as “illuminated substance”:    So those who say that matter is substance must be considered to be speaking  correctly if they are speaking of matter in the intelligible world.  For that  which underlies form There is substance, or rather, considered along with form  imposed upon it, it makes a whole which is illuminated substance. ( Ennead  II.4.5, 19-24)    This passage confirms that intelligible matter is “illuminated substance” consisting of  substance with “form imposed upon it”.   Plotinus refers to illumination or light  elsewhere as “formative power” ( Ennead I. 6.3, 18-19) and logos, interpreted as “the  rational forming principle” ( Ennead II.4.5, 7-8).  For Plotinus the concept of logos is  fundamental to his metaphysics as a principle of generation, process, order, and that  which constitutes Being.  It is considered to have been a development of the Stoic  logos,46 the logoi spermatikoi,  situated within, and acting upon physical matter to  produce things in the universe, although it is acknowledged that Plotinus rejects this  view because for him the logoi in the physical world “include powers which are prior to  the principles in the seeds” ( Ennead IV.4.39, 6-18).  Interpretations of the logoi in  Intellect have lacked precision; Pauliina Remes, for example, examines Plotinus’  concept in some depth and refers to them as “logical parts of forms… entities that  explain the details and differences of any one entity that will be instantiated in the  material realm” (Remes, 2007, p.8).47  While she accepts their ontological role as  “entities”, she does not explain what they are.  Similarly, John Deck devoted a whole  chapter to the subject without clarifying his description of logos as “the diversifying                                                                46  See for example: Witt, 1931, pp.103-111; Armstrong, 2013, pp.107-108; See discussion in:       Rist, 1977, pp.84-102.      47  For Remes’ analysis of Plotinus’ concept of logos or logoi see  Remes, 2007, pp.66-91.  </p><div id="pagenum"><p>92</p></div><p id="page">84   aspect of intellectuality” (Deck, 1991, p.80).48  Gerson has also examined the concept in  some depth (Gerson, 2012); however, vagueness within Plotinian scholarship is perhaps  due to the range of varying definitions of logos used in antiquity, and which are the  product of lexographers trying to make sense of that range.  The Liddell–Scott Greek- English Lexicon  refers to the following categories of usage: computation, reckoning;  relation, correspondence, proportion, ratio; explanation;  inward debate of the soul;  continuous statement, narrative (whether fact or fiction), oration, etc.; verbal expression  or utterance (not a single word); a particular utterance, saying;  thing spoken of, subject- matter; expression, utterance, speech regarded formally; the Word or Wisdom of God,  personified as his agent in creation and world-government.  The meaning of logos in  Plotinus appears within the third category of explanation , as “the generative principle  in organisms” and as “regulative and formative forces, derived from the intelligible and  operative in the sensible universe” (Liddell & Scott, Online)   Sleeman and Pollet’s  Lexicon Plotinianum includes various translations of the meaning of logos including: a)  of the spoken thought or written word; b) of reason in general, rational thought,  reasoning; c) of rational, creative, formative principles; of the concept, definition or  meaning of a thing; d) reasoning in argument, discussion, etc. e) used of proportion,  relation, counting, etc.” (Sleeman J. H. & Pollet G., 1980, pp.601-614).   The lack of clarity about the ontological status of logos in the Enneads is  therefore understandable; however, returning to the subject of intelligible matter, it was  proposed that logos is form and its underlying substance.  Plotinus clearly states that in  Intellect substance is number ( Ennead V.1.5.6-9); in Ennead V.1.5, 13-14, that: “What  is called number in the intelligible and the dyad are rational principles and Intellect”;  and in Ennead V.4.2, 7-8, “from the Indefinite Dyad and the One derive the forms and                                                                48  See Chapter 5, ‘Logos’. </p><div id="pagenum"><p>93</p></div><p id="page">85   numbers”.  Furthermore, in Ennead III.6.1,31 Plotinus refers to soul as “a number or  whether it is a rational formative principle, as we say it is”.  It can therefore be  ascertained that logos, and therefore intelligible matter, is form with number as its  underlying substance, as noted by Atkinson who has endeavoured to clarify the issue of  the difference between forms and numbers (Atkinson, 1983, pp.118-119).  Plotinus  introduces the concept of substantial number in Ennead V and specifically addresses it  in Ennead VI.6. 1, “On Numbers”; however, many commentators fail to acknowledge  it. Slaveva-Griffin comments:    If number has such a paramount ontogenic role in the intelligible, it seems  strange that it does not figure more prominently in all scholarly presentations  of Plotinus’ architecture of the universe.    She adds: “it is often buried in footnotes or hidden in the context between the lines” and  suggests the subject has simply been “overlooked”, and significantly, that “Plotinus’  conception of number is the fundamental framework on which his entire philosophical  system is built” (Slaveva-Griffin, 2009, p.3 and p.11).  Her important contribution,  Plotinus on Number , together with a less comprehensive account from Dimitri Nikulin49  is essential reading for anyone wishing to understand the different aspects of number  described by Plotinus; however, several issues remain unresolved.    For Plotinus, the One represents absolute unity, without form and must not be  considered as substance because “a substance must be some one particular thing,  something, that is defined and limited” ( Ennead V.5.6, 5-7).  Since each being/number  of Intellect is an individual intellect, it is also considered as a one-many unity.  In  Ennead V.1.5, 15-17 Plotinus states:                                                                  49  Nikulin, 2002.     </p><div id="pagenum"><p>94</p></div><p id="page">86   …each and every number [εἴδος] that comes from [the indefinite dyad] and the  One is a form, as if Intellect is shaped by the numbers [εἴδεσιν] which came to  exist in it.    It is important to note that Plotinus uses the words “εἴδος” and “εἴδεσιν” which  Armstrong translates as number and numbers respectively, hence he appears to conflate  forms with numbers, whereas in Makenna’s translation we have “Form-Idea” and  “Ideas”, which is even more ambiguous.  As noted above, the subject is examined by  Atkinson, who makes the point that Plotinus divides the shape of the forms into a formal  and material principle (Atkinson, 1983, pp. 118-119).     Furthermore, while each individual intellect shares the form and numbers of  Intellect, they differ in their participation of it ( Ennead V.5.5, 13); therefore if, as was  suggested, the forms are fractals of Intellect, they are defined in terms of unequal  numbers.   In VI.6.2-3, Plotinus discusses the number of infinity and its link with the  unlimited and limited.  He argues number cannot be infinite from a mathematical or  ontological perspective; since the objects of sense are not infinite, the substantial  number applying to them cannot be infinite either, because in the intelligible number is  limited to as many as the real Beings (Ennead VI.6.3, 2-3).  He continues, even if we  count with abstract numbers, we still finish with a finite number; therefore, the  unlimited is always limited.  Plotinus urges us away from thinking of infinity as in a  place because “…infinity … runs away from the idea of limit, … but when it is caught  place comes into existence” ( Ennead VI.6.3, 14-19), and Slaveva-Griffin notes that this  is “place in the sense of ontological instantiation” (Slaveva-Griffin, 2009, p.66).   As  previously explained (p.72), this can be understood the intellectual substantial “place”  of internal difference that is analogous to a node in the model of harmonics.   Furthermore, in VI.6.17 Plotinus examines the subject of number in terms of its limited </p><div id="pagenum"><p>95</p></div><p id="page">87   and unlimited nature.  When we speak of unlimited number, it is like the idea of a  limited line, we can always think of a longer one; numbers can also be multiplied in  thought.  But nothing is unlimited in Intellect because the idea of something unlimited  negates its real existence.  Unlimitedness, even an unlimited line, may exist in Intellect  in a form that is not the same as something that has an unreachable end.  He claims that  unlimitedness is after number; it proceeds from one point over a distance that cannot be  quantitatively measured.  It is proposed that nothing is unlimited in Intellect because  each form is limited by its node or substantial number; however once formed, it  becomes unlimited in its infinite and therefore unmeasurable generation.  Plotinus  suggests that forms exist as “unfigured figures”, which Slaveva Griffin describes as the  “antecedents of figures” such a “point, line, plane or solid” because they lack quantity,  quality and spatial extension (Slaveva-Griffin, 2009, p.120).  This is consistent with the  interpretation that Plotinus is thinking of the forms as vibrations.  The ontological status of Plotinus’ logos in Intellect makes more sense when it is  considered with his model of procession and reversion.  In this model, logos as  substantial number and form emulates the Pythagorean tradition of musical harmonics  in which an interval, the difference in pitch or ‘power’ between two notes, is understood  as a ratio or logos, not as monadic numbers we use to count or measure sensible things,  or points on a line that can be measured as linear distances.  In Ennead VI .6, ‘On  Numbers’, Plotinus establishes substantial numbers, or “numbered numbers”, measure  other things, but are not measured themselves ( Ennead VI.6.15), and they represent  unities in Intellect while acting as archetypes of monadic number that numbers things in  the sensible world.  As Slaveva-Griffin points out, “number does not count substance”  in Intellect (Slaveva-Griffin, 2009, p.78); substantial number has a purely ontological  and generative role.  </p><div id="pagenum"><p>96</p></div><p id="page">88   In VI.6.16 Plotinus argues that the substantial number within us is actualised by  outward appearances, thus generating the real existence of quantity, and he clarifies  what he means by the “substantial number within us”:    It is the number of our substance; for Plato says, since it participates in number  and melody it is again number and melody; for, one says, it is not body or  magnitude; the soul therefore is a number, if it is a substance.  The number of  body is certainly substance, in a bodily way, but the number of soul is  substances in the way souls are.  ( Ennead VI.6.16, 40-45)    In this passage Plotinus refers specifically to the link between substance, number and  melody, which can only mean the ratios that form the basis of musical melody.  This is  supported by Armstrong, who in a footnote to his translation of this passage refers to  Plato, Timaeus 36e6-37a1, and comments:     In considering Pythagorean and Platonic thought about numbers it is most  important always to remember that, from Pythagoras onwards, the numbers are  musical numbers, the numbers of melody and rhythm. (Armstrong, Plotinus  Ennead VI.6-9, fn.1, p.64)    Gerson acknowledges that ratios are important in Plotinus’ account of logos because he  is following Plato, and in referring to the difference between substantial number and  monadic number he states:     …we may suppose that the numbers that Aristotle says Plato identified with  Forms are not integers but rather ideal ratios, or, more exactly, constitutive  formulae of ratios of the elements that go to make up all the things in the  world.  To know a Form is then to see not an infinite array of ratios or even an  infinite array of ratios of ratios, but to see discrete ideal ratios of ratios.  (Gerson, 2012, p.21)    And in a footnote to this passage he refers to:   </p><div id="pagenum"><p>97</p></div><p id="page">89   Timaeus 53B5 where the Demiurge is said to have implanted intelligibility in  the preexistence chaos of pseudo-elements by giving it "shapes and numbers."  The "shapes" are the continuous quantities of the five regular solids and the  "numbers" are the discrete quantities that are ratios or formulae for creating  the actual elements and the things made out of these. (Gerson, 2012, p.21)      So, while Gerson is correct in his assertion about ratios, he links it with geometry, thus  failing to make the connection that for Plotinus harmonic ratios are linked to forms or  vibrations that have the power to give organised existence to the material world.    I propose that much of the difficulty experienced by commentators on Plotinus’  account of Intellect and the ontological status of logos arises from a general reluctance  to analyse the role of number in the Enneads.  It has been argued that whenever Plotinus  refers to intelligible matter, logos, or substance he means substantial number that must  be considered as a harmonic ratio, and form considered as a vibration.  Two questions  remain unanswered: How does number relate to the primary kinds: being, motion, rest,  otherness and sameness? What is the role of number in the generation of the Beings in  Intellect?  The answers proposed in the following section support the argument for a  strong Pythagorean influence on Plotinus.           3.5      The Generation and Nature of Being as Substantial Number        The question of how number relates to the primary kinds: being, motion, rest, otherness  and sameness, and its role in the generation of the Beings in Intellect, has not been  adequately explained in the secondary literature.  Plotinus’ reference to number and  melody, plus other music, sound, rhythm and dancing metaphors dotted throughout the  Enneads, has led Slaveva-Griffin to concur with Gerson that:   </p><div id="pagenum"><p>98</p></div><p id="page">90   there is a deeper ontological meaning in these metaphors.  … there is a certain  literalness to them that conceptually reveals the inherent ontological roles of  substantial number in the structure of the intelligible. (Slaveva-Griffin, 2009,  p.119).      While she acknowledges the link to the primary kinds she does not explain how they are  linked or their relevance to the generation of multiplicity.  Nikulin also comments that  Plotinus does not directly answer the question of how substantial number generates  multiplicity as a unity.  He suggests Plotinus “…gives a number of indirect indications  and provides a henological and ontological system within which the problem of the  constitution of number can be solved” (Nikulin, 2002, p.76); however, Slaveva-Griffin  points to difficulties with the interpretation because Plotinus uses the concepts of  monads and henads inconsistently (Slaveva-Griffin, 2009, pp.92-93).  It will be argued  that if Plotinus is founding his philosophy on substantial number that emulates  harmonic ratios, we must look to the Pythagoreans for clarification.  In Chapter 2, it was explained that for the Pythagoreans number is intimately  linked to the  tetractys that contains the three concordant and primary intervals of the  octave, fourth and fifth, regarded as the elements out of which any musical scale or  composition is built and the order governing the generation of the universe.50  The  Pythagoreans considered the tetractys to be the sacred figure by which they are said to  swear:  By him who gave to our soul the tetractys,  The source and root of everflowing nature.  (Sextus Empiricus, Against Professors , VII, 94-5, in Kahn 2001, p.31.)51                                                                  50  Chapter 2.1.4, pp.37-38.    51  See also: Burkert, 1972, pp.54-56. </p><div id="pagenum"><p>99</p></div><p id="page">91   It cannot be mere co-incidence that Plotinus refers to substantial number as the  “foundation” and “ source, root and principle ” of Beings (Ennead VI.6.9, 38-39, my  emphasis).  The influence of the Pythagorean tetractys on Plotinus has been noted by  Alexandrakis, who comments:    Both Pythagorean and Plotinian thought are directed towards an ordered  rational system: the Tetractys and the One. (Alexandrakis, 2002, p.153)    While Alexandrakis rightly makes the link, he does not explain how Plotinus  incorporates it into his metaphysics.  Nikulin makes no connection with the tetractys but  questions whether Plotinus limits the total number of substantial numbers to ten and  adds a footnote to inform us that “Plato… limits the number of the ideal numbers to ten  only”.  Since Plato’s ‘true numbers’ are Plotinus’ main reference, limiting them to ten  as ‘primaries’ would be fully in accordance with Plato under the influence of  Pythagorean number theory.  Nikulin also comments that Plotinus mentions the decad  in Ennead VI.6 forty-five times and suspects the decad is important and in some way  linked to substantial number; however, he notes that Plotinus is not explicit; Plotinus  “… gives no indication of whether the number of numbers is limited by a particular  number”.  Nikulin concludes that according to his interpretation substantial number  must be limited but is unable to explain why (Nikulin, 2002, pp.88, fn.103).  Nikulin’s  suspicion is confirmed by Plotinus who says: “the generation of number is already  limited and stands fast” ( Ennead VI.6.2, 8-9).  It is however contended that a solution  can be found within key points arising in VI.6, “On Numbers” and Ennead VI.2, ‘On  the Kinds of Being II’.  In VI.6.8, Plotinus claims that since Intellect comes after Being, substance was  already one and many in Being; Being as one and Intellect as two existed before the  Complete Living Being that encompasses all Beings, so number cannot be dependent on </p><div id="pagenum"><p>100</p></div><p id="page">92   it.  Substantial numbers are the “number in Being and with Being and before the  beings” (Ennead VI.6.9, 37-38); therefore, they must be linked to the primary kinds.  In  VI.6.9, Plotinus asks:  Did substance and movement, rest, same and other produce  number or did number generate them?  Does number exist before Being itself?  He aims  to prove that one is before number, and that number is generated from Being, its source.   Plotinus then sums up the nature of substantial number in the realm of the intelligible in  an important passage:    But, if numbers were before beings, they were not beings.  Now number was in  being, not as the number of being – for being was still one – but the power of  number which had come to exist divided being and made it… in labour to give  birth to multiplicity.  For number will be either the substance or the actual  activity of being, and the absolute living being is number, and intellect is  number.  Is not being, then, unified number, and the beings number unfolded,  and Intellect number moving in itself, and the Living Being inclusive number?   Since, because Being came into existence from the One, as that One was one,  Being must also in this way be number: this is why they called the Forms  henads and numbers.  And this is substantial number; but the other, which is  called monadic, is its image.  But substantial number is that contemplated in  the Forms and sharing in their generation, and, primarily, the number in Being  and with Being and before the beings.  The beings have their foundation in it,  and their source and root and principle. ( Ennead VI.6.9, 24-39)    For Plotinus there is a subtle difference in the substantial nature of Being and the  substantial numbers and forms ( logoi) in Intellect because ‘being’ is a ‘principle’ of  substance, the ‘law’ by which substantial numbers and forms ( logoi) are generated in  Intellect through procession and reversion.  Being is therefore ontologically prior.  It  can be deduced that number existed as substance potentially in inchoate Intellect and  actually as a “power” of Being, thus emulating the Pythagorean conception of number </p><div id="pagenum"><p>101</p></div><p id="page">93   as dynamis as discussed in Chapter 2.52  Slaveva-Griffin notes that Plotinus placed  substantial numbers “among the Platonic primary kinds: (being, rest, motion, same, and  other)” (Slaveva-Griffin, 2009, p.85), which makes sense because everything else  comes from them  (Ennead V.1.4, 42- 44).  Significantly, as Plotinus does not include  Intellect as one of the primary kinds ( Ennead VI.2.18, 12-14), like the One, it cannot be  a substantial number, so our focus must be solely on being, motion, rest, otherness and  sameness.  Plotinus begins Ennead VI.2.2 by arguing that the primary kinds are  “principles of substance” and “a composition”.  In Ennead VI.2.3, he refers to “several  genera” and suggests that this is not accidental.  While he does not specifically explain  why this is so, he makes the following points: The One must not be numbered with the  primary kinds because he is considering the genera as Being, not what is beyond being.    As Plotinus refers to substantial numbers as “numbered numbers” we can deduce that  each of the primary kinds is numbered as they are thought, for example movement is 1,  otherness 2, rest 3 and sameness 4.  Being itself is not numbered because for Plotinus,  Being is always a unified one.  Then he suggests that “If we grasp how many genera  there are it will tell us how they are.”  In Ennead VI.2.7-8, Plotinus presents the  argument that motion, rest, otherness and sameness must be considered an undivided  unity within Being.53  Each primary kind is an individual, a one, and therefore different  from the others, but all of them share the same nature.  Each is a unity of all the others,  for example, motion is a unity of being, rest, otherness and sameness, rest is a unity of  being, motion, otherness and sameness, and similarly for otherness and sameness.  For  Plotinus, it is Being that brings them into identity.  If you take movement and Being,                                                                52  Chapter 2.4, pp. 54-56.      53  See also Ennead V.1. 4, 33-41where Plotinus refers to them as all being simultaneous and  having a common unity.    </p><div id="pagenum"><p>102</p></div><p id="page">94   the two are one nature; movement appears in Being and being in movement, each taken  separately has the other; however, rest also appears in being because it exists “in the  same state and in the same way” ( Ennead VI.2.7).54    In VI.2.13, Plotinus states that number cannot be a primary kind itself because  number exists within the primary kinds ( Ennead VI.2.13, 7-9).  He claims that having  posited ‘three’ primary kinds we recognise difference in being; furthermore, we can add  another ‘two’, sameness and otherness, making a total of five.  In Ennead VI.2.17, 24- 25, Plotinus specifically, and almost deliberately, states that he has “counted up” the  primaries using monadic numbers; however, he makes it clear that substantial numbers  do not come together by counting because he is not thinking of each primary kind as  one unit.  It is therefore suggested that the Plotinian decad is created by adding the  numbers as they are numbered, 1+2+3+4 = 10, that is, Intellect numbers the primary  kinds as it thinks or separates them into distinct units that are in fact already unities  (Rist, 1963, p. 227).  While the number in Being totals ten, Being is always considered  to be one; however, while Plotinus does not give each individual kind a specific  number, each of the others could be numbered one to four as unities within Being which  Plotinus refers to as “unified number”.  In VI.6.14, 28, Plotinus asks: What is the proper cause of number? A thing is “one  by the presence of one and two by the presence of the dyad”, and the rest in the same  way.  Furthermore, in VI.6.16, 48-49 Plotinus refers to “the triad in real being” as “a  principle of substance”.  He continues VI.6.14 as follows:    But we must affirm that the decad is observed in one way in things that are  discrete and in another in things that are continuous, and in other ways in the  many unified powers of this particular number; and that we have already                                                                54  Plotinus quotes Plato’s Sophist 248A12.  </p><div id="pagenum"><p>103</p></div><p id="page">95   ascended among the intelligibles; and that there are true numbers, no longer  observed in other things but existing themselves on their own, the absolute  decad, not the decad of some intelligibles. ( Ennead VI.6.14, 44-50)     The dyad, triad and “absolute decad” must have a place in Being, notably for its “many  unified powers”.  While Plotinus does not explicitly refer to the link between the decad  and Being as “unified number” or “true numbers”, it appears to be implied here, and it is  helpful to return to the quotation from Stobaeus which refers to the Pythagorean  Decad:55     The power, efficacy and essence of number is seen in the Decad; it is great, it  realises all its purposes, and it is the cause of all effects.  The power of the  Decad is the principle and guide of all life, divine, celestial, or human into  which it is insinuated; without it everything is unlimited, obscure, and furtive.  (Stobaeus, Eclogae, 1.3.8, (DK 11), in Guthrie, 1988, p.171)    It is therefore suggested that Plotinus’ “absolute decad” reiterates its historical  significance and is intimately related to Plato’s true numbers and the Pythagorean  tetractys that contains the harmonic ratios which underlie the mathematical harmony of  the musical scale, the octave (1:2), the fifth (2:3) and the fourth (3:4), as well as the first  ten numbers that form the basis of all the numbers.  Since Being similarly contains  within itself the law by which the Beings are generated, it suggests that Plotinus limits  the number of substantial numbers to four, but their nature in Being expressed  graphically as per the tetractys is such that they form the basis of the decad, hence the  ability to count in monadic numbers.  Furthermore, in section 3.2, (p. 71), a passage was  quoted from Ennead V.5, 5 where Plotinus refers to Being as “the hearth of all  things”,56 a concept Philolaus used in his cosmogony to represent the Monad as the                                                                55  Originally quoted in Chapter 2, p.38.  56  Plotinus refers to the “hearth” again in Ennead VI.2.8,8.   </p><div id="pagenum"><p>104</p></div><p id="page">96   generating source of the universe, and like the Pythagorean tetractys, in this passage  Plotinus also links it to sound.    While this provides a solution to Nikulin’s questions about whether the number of  substantial numbers is limited by a particular number, and why the decad is linked to  substantial number, it is helpful to clarify how the four unities in Being form a decad.  If  we return to the Pythagorean tetractys (Figure 1) in Chapter 257 and take it to represent  the unity of Being by inputting Plotinus’s primary kinds, many different permutations of  unities can be formed because they are all of one nature and none of the primary kinds  is allocated an individual number.  In VI.2.11, 45-48, Plotinus states:    … in being nothing prevents some things from being prior and others  posterior, and some simple and some composite.    The position of any one primary kind within the structure of the tetractys is completely  irrelevant because the ratios and decad hold fast within it.  Figure 13 illustrates the  primary kinds as unities, and in Figure 14 they are represented by ‘●’.      Unities within the Plotinian Decad (Figure 13)                                                                          57  Chapter 2.1.4, p.38.  </p><div id="pagenum"><p>105</p></div><p id="page">97   The Plotinian Decad/ Tetractys (Figure 14)          Intellect of course thinks in terms of the whole numbers one two, three and four, just as  Plotinus did, and these numbers relate to unities that act as a substantial base for the  forms.  Considered in terms of whole numbers they demonstrate the generation of  Beings in terms of the number of Beings in Intellect, and when considered as ratios they  measure the interval or distance between them that determines the shape of, and quality  within the forms.    It is proposed that for Plotinus, numbers are actualities, with the power to  generate vibratory motion through which Intellect divides itself into partials or forms  because numbers represent nodes or a stable base for the forms.  Significantly, this  reveals that number-figuration has an ontogenic function for Plotinus.  Substantial  numbers break up the power of the One which when interpreted within the harmonics  model produces forms or Beings that have their own character, just as the vibratory  motion of sound produces tones that convey meaning in terms of the character of sound;  not as notes that are considered to have a purely spatial dimension as when placed on a  musical score.  Plotinus transfers the physical nature of ‘tone’ into a metaphysical  principle describing the essential characteristics, i.e., quality, quantity, shape, etc., that  </p><div id="pagenum"><p>106</p></div><p id="page">98   each form contains rolled up within it and that can be expressed as a composite in  physical matter.  He states, Intellect:     … has each and every reason why of the things in it; but it is itself individually  all the things in it . . . all the things each individual has are each individual  reason why . . . the reason why is contained in its existence. ( Ennead VI.7.2,  25-49)    This means each material thing has a vibration of what it is, and each particular  vibration is an activity of substantial number, otherwise referred to as logos or rational  forming principle.  This rolled up nature of the individual form reflects the fractal  nature of Intellect, because each individual intellect is a proportional representation of  Intellect divided according to the same law of harmonics but diminished in numerical  value because it commences on a lower scale.        Conclusion        The harmonics model together with the Pythagorean influence on Plotinus explains  several difficulties perceived by Plotinian scholars. It was argued that the mechanism of  procession and reversion is harmonic motion that generates Intellect and its content as  an integrated compound series consisting of a fundamental and its self-generated  harmonics.  While it was noted that it could quite reasonably be rejected on the basis  that the physics of standing waves was not understood in Plotinus’ day, it was suggested  that the argument cannot be dismissed.  Vitruvius had already regarded sound as a  mechanical wave similar to waves in water that when obstructed flow back and break  up the subsequent waves.  It is conceivable that it was understood by Plotinus due to his  knowledge of mechanics and the fact that Nichomachus had already linked harmonics </p><div id="pagenum"><p>107</p></div><p id="page">99   to vibrations.  Plotinus’ reference to intelligible matter in Intellect as logos fits into the  harmonics model if it is understood as substantial number which must be considered as  a harmonic ratio, and form considered as a vibration.  Furthermore, it was argued that  number relates to the primary kinds: being, motion, rest, otherness and sameness since  they are unities or powers in Being.  Not only does  Plotinus replicate the Pythagorean  theory of opposites with his primary kinds, the nature of Being can be understood as the  decad that he believed the Pythagoreans represented graphically as the tetractys.  Plotinus is not explicit about the harmonics model in the text; however, there is  no doubt that it is compatible with his account. Nothing has been found in the text that  seriously challenges the argument.  It is significant that it potentially overcomes so  many ambiguities noted by commentators, and if this is the case, it is a remarkable  development of Pythagorean philosophy that was founded on the science of harmonics.   The following Chapter will examine how this new interpretation provides greater  clarity about his account of the generation of the Hypostasis  Soul and matter and  provides further support to the arguments presented here.                     </p><div id="pagenum"><p>108</p></div><p id="page">100   Chapter 4    Plotinus - The Generation of Soul and Origin of Matter    *      Introduction        This Chapter argues that the model of harmonics provides a solution to ambiguity in  Plotinus’ account of Soul and Matter, the text of which has caused debate amongst  scholars.  With the aid of illustrations, it explains the nature of the Hypostasis Soul , its  role in the generation of the World Soul  and Soul of individual souls, and their  relationship with Intellect.  Then it examines the role of ‘providence’ in the making of  the universe by the World Soul , and subsequently explains the application of the  Pythagorean concepts of harmonia and sympathia,  and how sympathia provides the  ontological basis of synesis, an a priori intuition that functions in the integration of  body and Soul.  It will be argued that Plotinus’ account of Soul only makes sense from  the perspective of the harmonics model proposed in Chapter 3, and that  disagreement  amongst scholars concerning the role of music and musical metaphors in the Enneads  arises because they have failed to understand how harmonics are generated in Intellect.   Furthermore, it will also claim  that the Pythagorean influence on Plotinus’ theory of  Soul has been misunderstood and underestimated.  Finally, disagreements about the  nature and origin of matter are discussed and a solution is proposed that conforms to  the harmonics model.  As in Chapter 3, the influence of Plato’s cosmology in the  Timaeus which is based on the harmonic series (35b-c) is presumed.  The comparison  will be made directly with the Pythagorean tradition discussed in Chapter 2.    </p><div id="pagenum"><p>109</p></div><p id="page">101   4.1   The Levels of Soul and their Relationship with Intellect        According to Plotinus’ theory of procession from the One, Intellect generates the  Hypostasis Soul  that generates the World Soul  and the Soul of individual souls;  however, commentators have noticed ambiguity concerning the various levels of Soul.  Majumdar, for example, references Blumenthal and remarks that Plotinus:    …appears to use the World Soul and the Hypostasis Soul interchangeably,  leaving no intermediary between Intellect and the World Soul …thus in II.3 17- 18, the World Soul seems to be contiguous to Intellect in the ontological order.  (Majumdar, 2007, p.47)    She proposes that the Hypostasis Soul  is a rational form (Majumdar, 2007, p.46);  however, it is suggested that the mechanism of harmonic motion helps to clarify the  various levels.  Chapter 3 explained how in the physics of harmonics the displacement  of the string caused by the reflection of energy between two nodes effectively divides  the string in half creating two standing waves and an additional node, and this  corresponds to the generation of Soul as the third stationary node and two additional  forms by the second instance of procession and reversion.58  Plotinus states:    The soul which abides is a single expression of Intellect, and from it spring  partial expressions which are also immaterial, just as in the world of intellect.  (Ennead IV.3.5, 17-19)    It is reasonable to assume that the Hypostasis Soul  is the “soul that abides”, because as  the third stationary node it generates the forms of the World Soul  and the Soul of  individual souls (Figure 15), but it is not a form itself, thus challenging the view  expressed by Majumdar.                                                                58  Chapter 3.3, p.77. </p><div id="pagenum"><p>110</p></div><p id="page">102   Generation of World Soul  and Soul of Individual Souls (Figure 15)          Furthermore, Plotinus states that the Hypostasis Soul  itself is a number ( Ennead  VI.6.16, 45), and while Plotinus considers substantial number to be prior to the forms  as holding ‘places’ for the forms, Soul comes in “third place” after the One, Being  and  Intellect (Ennead V.1.10, 4-5).  Number is generated as ‘place’ or rest when “infinity is  caught” (Ennead VI.6.3, 16).  The Hypostasis Soul  represents the first substantial  number that must be two since Being is one; however, Plotinus also tells us that the two  and the half are generated simultaneously:    The double and the half come into existence together, they are two and one  respectively – also the double has the name and reality of the double and the  one the name and reality of the half.  ( Ennead VI.1.7, 32-33)    We can therefore consider the Hypostasis Soul  as two in Intellect and as half in its  function of dividing Intellect, which could be represented by the ratio 1:2 which is the  second harmonic.  Ratio makes sense because it refers to intervals, and for Plotinus  unity was measured in terms of ontological difference, or distance from the One  (Ennead IV.3.11, 23-24).  In musical terms the ratio 1:2 represents an interval that is the  same tone an octave lower than the fundamental, hence Plotinus’ assertion that Soul is  an inferior image, imitation, or “ghost” of Intellect (Ennead V.1.6, 47).  For Plotinus the  </p><div id="pagenum"><p>111</p></div><p id="page">103   natural order of generation is one in which the number of Beings (nodes and forms)  increase while there is a reciprocal diminishment of value in the progeny, and whereas  we normally think of an ascending musical scale, do-rei-mi etc., Plotinus, following the  Pythagoreans and Plato adopts a descending scale, from the higher octave to the lower  that was normal in ancient Greece (Barker, 2007, p.13).  The partial expressions of the Hypostasis Soul  are initially two souls; the World  Soul, which is responsible for regulating natural organic processes and for generating  souls that will be expressed in nature as forms of bodies, including human bodies, and  the Soul that generates individual souls; however, Plotinus tells us that the World Soul is  the elder of the two because it was generated first ( Ennead IV.4.36, 25-26).  This can be  explained by following the arrows indicating the movement of procession and reversion  in Figure 15 which shows that Soul is generated after the World Soul .  Both of these primary Soul forms generate their offspring as partial expressions of  themselves ( Ennead V.7.3, 23-24) according to the rule of decreasing proportion, but  one in which the earlier expressions remain intact in the latter.  Plotinus states:    In Intellect, as in Soul, there is again the infinity of these principles [numbers]  which come out ready for use in Soul. ( Ennead V.7.3, 24-25)59     The model of harmonic generation means that each Soul becomes a fundamental in its  own right, generating its own harmonics within itself whilst remaining within Intellect  (Figure 16).                                                                          59  Brackets mine, to clarify that the nature of the principles is substantial number.  </p><div id="pagenum"><p>112</p></div><p id="page">104   Harmonic Generation of Soul and World Soul (Figure 16)        It is suggested that if Plotinus is basing the generation of Beings on the harmonics  model, we must consider the Hypostasis  Soul and its progeny to be included in the  generation of Beings in Intellect, that is, at its highest possible level.  Plotinus refers to  Soul as the “matter” of Intellect (Ennead V.9.4, 11-12), which can only be intelligible  matter that was established in Chapter 3 to be substance or number that serves as a base  for the forms of individual intellects, which are also Beings as souls of everything in  the universe.  In a short treatise, Ennead III.9 ‘Various Considerations’, Plotinus refers  to Plato as presenting a “planning” principle proceeding from Intellect that makes the  universe as a result of seeing or thinking Intellect.  Plotinus refers to this principle as  Soul.  While Intellect sees Being as many, that is moving in itself or thinking in whole  numbers, it is the Hypostasis Soul  as an activity of Intellect that divides Intellect into  forms by acting as a node; the World Soul  divides Intellect by expressing the forms  individually:    what is the third, which “planned” itself to construct and make and divide into  parts the things seen by Intellect in the living creature?  Now it is possible that  in one way it may be Intellect that divides, but in another way the divider may  not be Intellect; for in so far as the things divided into parts come from it, it is  itself the divider, but in so far as it remains undivided itself, and it is the things  </p><div id="pagenum"><p>113</p></div><p id="page">105   which come from it which are divided – and these are souls - it is Soul which  makes the division into many souls. ( Ennead III.9.1, 26-41)    It is also important to note that Plotinus distinguishes between an activity belonging to  substance and one that goes out from substance but differs from it ( Ennead V.4.2, 28- 32).  So, while the Soul of individual souls and the World Soul  are in Intellect as  intellects at their highest level and are therefore an activity belonging to Intellect, they  are also different from Intellect when considered as Intellect’s  external activity.  The  difference lies in their thinking and function.  For Plotinus, “intellect is all things  together and also not together, because each is a special power” ( Ennead V.9.6, 8-9);  the function of the higher Souls is to express these powers discursively.  Similarly,  Plotinus states we possess the forms in two ways, “in our soul, in a manner of speaking  unfolded and separated, in Intellect all together” ( Ennead I.1. 8, 6-8).  If we think of  Intellect as a fundamental tone, the individual harmonics are all sounded together;  however, in souls that think discursively, the harmonics are expressed individually one  after another, that is, in temporal succession as in a musical scale or melody:    It is like a long life stretched out at length; each part is different from that which  comes next in order, but the whole is continuous with itself, but with one part  differentiated from another, and the earlier does not perish in the later. ( Ennead  V.2.2, 27-30)    Hence for Plotinus, Soul is not in time; this temporal succession is the life of the Soul.  Having explained that the harmonics model clarifies the generation and status of  the Hypostasis Soul  and the primary Soul forms, it becomes necessary to account for its  presence in Plotinus’ description of the characteristics of the dual Souls, and since it is  the elder of the two I begin with the World Soul .     </p><div id="pagenum"><p>114</p></div><p id="page">106   4.2   The World Soul , Providence and the Making of the Universe        In the examination of the World Soul , Providence and the making of the universe it will  be explained how Plotinus assimilates key Pythagorean concepts into his cosmology.  According to Plotinus the World Soul  was generated first and its function is to produce  and maintain the universe according to the rational principles it receives from Intellect,  that is, according to providence.  The bodies generated by the World Soul  are souls  themselves because they have a “trace of the World Soul” ( Ennead II.3.9, 23).   In  Ennead II.2.1, 38-39, Plotinus states that “Nature is just what has been ordained by  universal soul”.  It does not make by “deliberate choice” ( Ennead IV.4.36, 26) or  reasoning, but by necessity according to a law of decreasing proportion such as we see  in harmonic generation:      And since the Soul acts as a genus or specific form, the other souls act as  specific forms.  And the activities of these are double; that which is directed  above is intellect, and that which is directed below is the other powers in  proportion and order. ( Ennead V1.2.22, 28-31)60    Nature, the lowest aspect of the World Soul, organises the universe so that each part  grows and evolves, having a function according to its logos while being related to and  contributing advantageously to the whole because it provides the world with a formal  structure and the individual soul with a body with which it perceives and lives in the  world.  Nature has a soul that is a trace of its maker and is therefore correspondingly  weak; however, its presence to matter as a diminished logos makes living bodies as it  unfolds the logos it contains.  As such, it does not contemplate or return to Intellect, but  like Intellect it contemplates itself, not generating new rational forming principles but                                                                60  See also Ennead II.3.13, 4-5 and Ennead III.3.3, 20-30. </p><div id="pagenum"><p>115</p></div><p id="page">107   unfolding the diminished principles it contains within itself.61  Each body therefore is a  logos, which as explained in Chapter 3,62 must be understood as substantial number and  form:    Even in seeds it is not the moisture which is honourable, but what is unseen:  and this is number and rational principle. ( Ennead V.1.5, 12-15)    The matter to which it is present reflects the forms in the same way a body of a stringed  musical instrument makes the vibrations of the string perceptible; however we must not  think of nature as producing spatial objects or images because Plotinus specifically  denies nature the power of imagination ( Ennead IV.4.13, 7-9 and 11-15); imagination is  a faculty involved in perception and is a power of the individual soul that descends to its  body.63  At the level of nature, before human or animal perception the Plotinian  universe is, like Bergson’s durational universe, a field of vibrating energy.  Plotinus  refers to nature as the vegetative soul, which is responsible for the growth and nutrition  and reproduction of living beings ( Ennead IV.3.23, 36-43; IV.9.3, 11-29), as well as  seeking the remedy for any pain or distress suffered by the body ( Ennead IV.4.20, 22- 36).  It therefore has the power to transform itself within the bodies it makes, and this  transformational power reflects the Pythagorean concept of nature, ordered by number,  and which they considered to be a power that is “perpetually realised by a transition to a  different status of itself” (Viltanioti, 2012, p.26).64                                                                61  See: Deck, 1991, p.87-90.  62  Chapter 3.4, pp.82-89.   63  Imagination as a faculty or power, and its function within perception and memory of the  individual soul, will be examined in Chapter 8.      64  Chapter 2.1.1, p.34.  </p><div id="pagenum"><p>116</p></div><p id="page">108   It is the function of the World Soul  to make and maintain the universe in balance  or harmony.  In Enneads III.2 and III.3, ‘On Providence (1)’ and ‘On Providence (2)’  respectively, Plotinus refers to both the making of the universe and the interaction of  the parts in musical terms.  He uses the word ἁρμονία, which as noted in Chapter 2,65  refers to the Pythagorean concept of harmonia , the concordant intervals of a musical  scale which are ‘fitted together’ or interlocked according to proportions of an unequal  ratio.  While Armstrong translates ἁρμονία as melody, it is likely Plotinus intended it as  it was used in Pythagorean harmonics, that is, the fitting together of opposites, though  ‘melody’ would be appropriate for temporal making.    On composing the universe, the World Soul  places individual bodies into places  according to their “worth”, worth here meaning their logos, each of which has a unique  character and is placed so it is “in tune with the rational principle of the universe”  (Ennead III.2.17, 59-61) or according to the “the law of correspondence” ( Ennead  III.3.5, 4), although the term ‘attunement’ is more appropriate given the musical  significance.  Plotinus states, the individual contributes to the harmony of the universe  by “contributing his own sound” and proposes even in a panpipe the stronger and  weaker notes contribute to its harmony, which is complete and made up of all of them.   “So too the universal rational principle is one, but it is divided into parts which are not  equal” (Ennead III.2.17, 71-77).  The inequality of the parts is necessary because  Providence ensures war and strife, as well as friendship in the universe, due the  separation of parts:     From that true universe which is one this universe comes into existence, which  is not truly one for it is many and divided into a multiplicity, and one part  stands away from another and is alien to it, and there is not only friendship but                                                                65  Chapter 2.1.3, p.37. </p><div id="pagenum"><p>117</p></div><p id="page">109   also enmity because of the separation, and in their deficiency one part is of  necessity at war with another. ( Ennead III.2.2, 1-8)    The parts are in conflict in many places, but the All is in accordance with its  rational formative pattern, and it is necessary that this one formative pattern  should be one pattern made out of opposites, since it is opposition of this kind  which gives it its structure, and, we might say its existence. ( Ennead III.2.16,  48-52)    Plotinus therefore follows the Pythagoreans in maintaining that conflict between  opposites occurs, just as high and low notes are built into the laws of harmonics.  He  seems to consider conflicting sounds in terms of high and low, not harmonic and  disharmonic, a view also shared by Alexandrakis, who comments: “What Plotinus has  in mind here is the Pythagorean combination of higher and lower sounds into an  harmonia” (Alexandrakis, 2002, p.153).  The conflicting sounds  exist as a unity within  the fundamental, and which come together as musical ratios, hence ἁρμονία:    …but in the universe the battle of conflicting elements springs from a single  rational principle; so that it would be better for one to compare it to the melody  [ἁρμονία] which results from conflicting sounds, and one will then enquire  why there are conflicting sounds in the rational proportions {of musical  scales}.  If, then, in music the laws of rational proportion make high and low  notes and come together in a unity – being the proportional laws of melody  [ἁρμονία] they come together into the melody [ἁρμονία] itself, which is  another greater law of proportion, while they are lesser ones and part of it; in  the universe too we see the opposites. ( Ennead III.2.16, 39-46)    This passage supports the harmonic model theory because it demonstrates that Plotinus  recognised two different laws of proportion.  The first appears to be the purely  mathematical physical law of acoustics, in which the fundamental generates harmonics  as whole numbers by dividing itself as in Intellect, and the second, which Plotinus  considers to be the “greater law”, is the musical law that determines the “lesser ones”, </p><div id="pagenum"><p>118</p></div><p id="page">110   the ratios of the musical scale and which are also contained within unified Being, his  version of the Pythagorean tetractys.  As was suggested in Chapter 3, Plotinus’  ‘tetractys’ is constituted from the four primary kinds that are numbered and unified in  Being as substantial numbers as musical ratios, and which when totalled (1+2+3+4)  form the basis of the decad.  The Pythagorean tetractys represented the order by which  the cosmos is generated and similarly, Plotinus refers to Being as containing within  itself the law by which the Beings are generated.66  Plotinus is eager to ensure that we  do not mistake the generation of body in the sense of the World Soul  “tuning” the body  or being in tune with it.  He states: “For though the Pythagoreans meant this term,  tuning in another sense”, (that is in the sense that he also proposes), “people thought it  was something like the tuning of strings” ( Ennead IV.7.84,3-5).  For Plotinus the World  Soul, considered as a fundamental, is already a harmony in the same way that Intellect  is, so it does not need to tune or be in tune with its contents.   It is the function of the World Soul  to maintain harmony in the universe once it is  made, because the interaction of the parts has the potential to create new bodies that are  not rational principles in Intellect.  As will be discussed in section 4.4, physical matter  is non-being; so, any interaction of the parts can only occur between the forms of souls  that animate material bodies.  The Plotinian universe therefore contains individual  energies or vibrations that interact and impact on each other both positively and  negatively.  If the interaction is considered in musical terms, the universe is a  harmonious whole, like an orchestra in which each instrument plays its part in the  symphony unfolding in time; however, if a musician makes a mistake or if an  instrument is badly tuned there is the potential for disharmony.  When considered  purely in the context of modern physics, if standing waves interact they combine to                                                                66  Chapter 3.5, pp.96-97. </p><div id="pagenum"><p>119</p></div><p id="page">111   produce either constructive or destructive interference (Gunther, 2012, pp.209-211),  potentially changing the vibration of one or both for better or worse.  In each case of  interference in the Plotinian universe a new ‘node’ or existence is generated that does  not receive its rational forming principle from Intellect. Plotinus is however thinking  purely in musical terms:    … this All has arisen and separated into parts, and of necessity some became  friendly and gentle, others hostile and at war, and some did harm to each other  willingly, some too, unwillingly, and some by their destruction brought about  the coming to be of others, and over them all as they acted and were acted  upon in these kinds of ways they began a single melody [ἁρμονία], each of  them uttering their own sounds, and the forming principle over them producing  the melody [ἁρμονία] and the single ordering of all together to the whole.  (Ennead III.2.2, 25-33)     Maintenance of the universe involves making continual adjustments to the products of  nature that puts some things together badly, “as when a lyre is not so tuned that it takes  the melody [harmony] accurately so as to make it musical” ( Ennead II.3.13, 46-47).  In  this metaphor the lyre represents a body in the universe and the lack of tuning implies  disharmony when the musical ratios are applied by nature under the order of the World  Soul.  According to Plotinus:    … it makes some things without hindrance, but in others, the worse ones, it  meets obstruction.  Since its power to make is derived, and it is filled with  forming principles that are not the original ones, it will not simply make  according to the forms which it has received but there would be a contribution  of its own, and this is obviously worse.  Its product is a living being, but a very  imperfect one. ( Ennead II.3.17, 18-22)    The products of nature are therefore imperfect compared to the Beings in Intellect  because nature starts from a much lower level in terms of its logos.  This together with </p><div id="pagenum"><p>120</p></div><p id="page">112   the various degrees of passivity, activity and opposition of the parts means that  maintenance is necessary; however, the World Soul  maintains the universe in perfect  order according to the laws of providence ( Ennead II.3.13, 35-42).  Having explained how the harmonics model is implicit in the method by which  the World Soul  orders and maintains bodies for living beings, and how they interact, the  following section will examine how the individual soul as a rational being becomes  present to its body.          4.3   The Integration of Body and Soul        This section will explore how the Pythagorean concepts of harmonia and sympathia,   function in the integration of body and Soul, and will speculate that under the influence  of Aristoxenus  sympathia forms the ontological basis of  synesis, an a priori intuition  that functions in the soul.   It will then examine the subject of music as metaphor in the  Enneads.  The World Soul  participates directly in Intellect to make bodies; however, it  does not descend to this world because it has the world within itself ( Ennead IV.3.11).   Individual souls therefore depend on the World Soul  for the making of their physical  bodies:     …there is, … a difference between souls, and all the more in that the Soul of  the All has not separated itself from the soul as a whole but remained there and  put on the body, but the individual souls, since body exists already, received  their allotted parts when their sister soul, as we may say, was already ruling, as  if it had already prepared their dwellings for them. ( Ennead IV.3.6, 11-15)   </p><div id="pagenum"><p>121</p></div><p id="page">113   Plotinus refers to the Soul as being in the middle position between Intellect and matter  (Ennead VI.8.7, 5-9) because its thinking moves between the two.  The upper part of  the individual soul is eternally within Intellect (Ennead IV.8.8, 1-3), thinking non- discursively like Intellect, seeing all its objects simultaneously as whole; and when it  directs its attention to the individual images in matter it thinks discursively, employing  logical activity, propositions and syllogisms ( Ennead I.3.4, 17-19).  Its moral activity  arises from a gift of providence, the freedom to choose.67  While the World Soul   governs our association with our bodies:     The other soul, by which we are ourselves, is the cause of our well-being, not  of our being.  It comes when our body is already in existence, making only  minor contributions from reasoning to our being. ( Ennead II.1.5, 20-24)    Individual souls remain in Intellect until they receive an “illumination” from the World  Soul that incites the descent of the individual soul into a body.  As noted in Chapter 3,68  light or illumination refers to power or logos:    Now the soul which comes from the divine was quiet, standing in itself  according to its character; but the body, in a tumult because of its weakness,  flowing away itself and battered by the blows from outside, first itself cried out  to the community of the living thing and imparted its disturbance to the whole.  (Ennead VI.4.15, 19-23)    Previously, Plotinus described the union of soul and body as “hearing made actual”; the  soul hears the cries of the body ( Ennead VI.4.14, 28).  This is possible because soul  and body are substance, that is, substantial number and form:                                                                   67  This subject will be explored in detail in Chapter 8, which examines the nature of kairos in  the Enneads.    68  Chapter 3.4, p.83. </p><div id="pagenum"><p>122</p></div><p id="page">114   The number of body is certainly substance, in a bodily way, but the number of  soul is substances in the way souls are. ( Ennead VI.6.16, 45-46)    But the souls of men see their images as if in the mirror of Dionysus and come  to be on that level with a leap from above. ( Ennead IV.3.12, 1-3)    In a footnote to the translation,  Armstrong explains that the mirror of Dionysus is a  symbol of the visible world of physical matter which attracts the souls that must  descend into it.69  Plotinus explains that the soul does not descend because it is sent or  because it deliberately chooses to do so, but it does it “as if of its own accord” ( Ennead  IV.3.13, 7-8).  It is:    …like a natural spontaneous jumping or a passionate natural desire of sexual  union or as some men are moved unreasonably to noble deeds. … the  individual … is sent according to law …, given to be in those themselves who  are subject to it, and they bear it about with them. ( Ennead IV.3.13, 19-27)      Plotinus seems to suggest that it is an inherent instinct or intuition operating according  to natural law.  This is possible because each soul comes down to a body made ready  for it according to its resemblance to that soul’s disposition ( Ennead IV.3.13, 1-6).  The  World Soul  fits human souls into the universe according to the law of correspondence or  attunement:    Since each individual is fitted in according to justice, in the parts of the  universe designed to receive him; just as each string is set in its own proper  place according to rational proportion which governs the sounding of notes, of  whatever quality its power of producing a note is. ( Ennead III.2.17, 59-64)    There is therefore an intimate connection between individual souls and their bodies  because of their shared association with the Hypostasis Soul ; they have the same form                                                                69  Armstrong, Ennead IV.3.12, fn. 2, pp.72-73. </p><div id="pagenum"><p>123</p></div><p id="page">115   and share its substance, and because the individual soul had “… an adaptability present  to it, it had that to which it was adapted …, the body … was not alien to it” ( Ennead  VI.4.15, 2-18).  In effect body and soul function according to the same “law”, and as  such we can consider the body produced by the World Soul  as having a ‘tone’ which  vibrates at a certain frequency, its “illumination”, and it resonates with or is attuned70 to  the vibration of the individual soul.  This does not mean that the substantial numbers of  the body and soul are quantitatively equal.  Plotinus refers to them in terms of value,  which is qualitative; they are linked according to musical ratios consisting of unequal  whole numbers, but they are in sympathetic harmony with each other.  For Plotinus  sympathetic interaction is essential as a cause of producing harmony and change in the  physical universe; it is not just the result of the unfolding of rational principles in  nature, of which we can think in terms of a musical scale, a sequence of steps that  unfold successively in time:71    …one part is in sympathetic connection with another, just as in one tense  string; for if the string is plucked at the lower end, it has a vibration at the  upper.  But often too, when one string is plucked another has a kind of sense of  this by its concord and the fact that it is tuned to the same scale.  But if the  vibration can even pass from one lyre to another in so far as a sympathy exists,  then there is also one single harmony in the All, even if it is composed of  opposites. ( Ennead IV.4.41 2-9)    Plotinus compares the harmonious adjustment of individual souls to the order in the  universe with the Pythagorean conception of the harmony of the spheres:                                                                  70  Barker describes attunement as “simply a structure or pattern, in which no element is  temporally prior to any other” (Barker, 2007, fn.5, p.8).    71  Ibid.

(And this is more  properly the hidden meaning of the doctrine that the heavenly spheres move  musically and melodically). ( Ennead IV.3.12, 20-27)    In Ennead IV.4 Plotinus frequently refers to musical examples to explain the concept of  sympathy :  But if we remember that we posited that the universe is a single living thing,  and that since it is so it was absolutely necessary for it to have an internal self- communication of its experiences; and if we remember further that the process  of its life must be rational and all in tune with itself, and that there is nothing  casual in its life but a single melody and order, and that the celestial  arrangements are rational, and each individual part moves by numbers …  (Ennead IV.4.35, 8-13)    Gurtler emphasises the influence of the Stoic notion of the “the organic unity of the  cosmos as the eternal basis for perceptual awareness” and he also acknowledges “The  Stoic term sympathy fills out the Platonic notion that the universe is a single living  organism ( Timaeus 30d3-31a1)” (Gurtler, 2002, pp. 241-2).72  It is suggested that too  many commentators overemphasise the relevance of Stoic concepts in the Enneads, and  this is particularly relevant when discussing the Plotinian understanding of sympathy ,  for not only does Plotinus refer specifically to the music of the spheres to account for  universal harmony, he also understood that the Pythagoreans considered sympathy  to be  natural in a cosmos ordered on harmonic principles.  Rather than limiting our thinking  to a single living organism, we must also take account of the underlying harmonic  structure.                                                                72  See also: Emilsson, 1988, p.111 who also shares the view that “Plotinus’ notion of       sympatheia is a borrowing from the Stoics”.    </p><div id="pagenum"><p>125</p></div><p id="page">117   While harmonics lie at the ontological basis of sympathy , they also appear to form  the basis of synesis (σύνεσις), the lack of a ‘reasoned’ awareness, consciousness or  understanding of individual souls when they descend to their bodies.  Plotinus states  that souls perceive their bodies; however, they do not reason before they unite with  them (Ennead IV.3.18, 1-8), hence they descend without possessing ‘reasoned’  knowledge of why they do so.  Aristotle also refers to synesis in the context of a  capacity to comprehend without making judgements based on reason or rational  calculation ( De Anima  429a 23-25; Nicomachean Ethics , 1143a 1-35), and I refer again  to Aristoxenus who adopted the term synesis to refer to an a priori or innate form of  musical intuition that forms the basis of all musical activity.73  As Levin explains, for  Aristoxenus the creation of music depends on synesis “buried deep in soul”, not on  reason in the form of “musical notation harmonic science or musical instruments”  (Levin, 1972, p.229).  If one considers Plotinus’ “law” that human souls “bear about  with them” and which causes them to “spontaneously” descend into their bodies,  together with the notion of attunement, melody and order in the universe, it appears that  the synesis of souls also operates according to an a priori innate musical intuition that  does not depend on rational calculation or reasoning.    Deck notes that in Ennead IV.4.13, 2-14, Plotinus states that “nature has no grasp,  no synesis”, Ennead III.8.8, 14-16, in which nature possesses “naturely knowledge” and  Ennead III.8.4, 22-25, where nature has the sort of consciousness of “sleep” rather than  wakefulness.  While Deck suggests it could be that nature’s knowledge is “close to  unconscious” (Deck, 1991, pp.88-90)74, Hutchinson clarifies the character of its  unconsciousness:                                                                73  Chapter 2.4, pp.52-53.   74  See also: Armstrong, Ennead IV.4.13, fn.1, pp.170-171.  </p><div id="pagenum"><p>126</p></div><p id="page">118   Nature directs its contemplation exclusively on the logoi it contains, and it  produces bodies spontaneously, without any conscious reflection on, or  deliberation over, what it is doing. (Hutchinson, 2018. p.154)     Plotinus states that nature has no synesis because it has no perception or understanding  of the soul that is outside it; it perceives itself rather than the soul (Ennead III.8.4, 14- 23), which explains why bodies do not go to meet their corresponding souls.  Therefore,  while sympathia  is operative in nature as well as between nature and the soul, synesis  only occurs in the soul, which descends to its body because it perceives, distinguishes  and is therefore conscious, but its understanding is intuitive and unconscious, just as it  is for Aristoxenus; however, only Aristoxenus insists on the importance of memory in  the process.  For Plotinus, synesis appears to be wholly dependent upon sympathia .      While Plotinus does not refer to Aristoxenus explicitly, according to Porphyry,  Plotinus “had a complete knowledge” of music, (Porphyry 13, 8-10); therefore, it is  possible that he would have been familiar with the concept of synesis in the Elements of  Harmonics of Aristoxenus, a student of Aristotle, and who is described by Levin as “the  foremost technical writer on the music of ancient Greece” (Levin, 1972, pp.223-224).   Pythagorean harmonics underpins the ontological structure that facilitates sympathy  in  Plotinus’ metaphysics and one can speculate that Aristoxenus influenced his  epistemology with the concept of synesis in the soul.  Whether we view mind and body in terms of vibrations or number Plotinus does  not propose two different kinds of substance à la Descartes.  Plotinus avoids Descartes’  dualism because unlike solid material objects, numbers and their corresponding  vibrations or forms are energies or powers that have no physical extension and can be in  the same place at the same time.  In fact, as body is further away from unity than the  individual soul because it is closer to physical matter, its substance or number could be </p><div id="pagenum"><p>127</p></div><p id="page">119   of lesser value than that of the individual soul.  Plotinus states that “when the particular  souls go to things”:    They have departed to the depths; or rather, a great part of them has been  dragged down and has dragged them with it by their thoughts to the lower  existence. ( Ennead IV.3.6, 25-27)    We must remember that at the level of Intellect, the individual soul has all the numbers  in itself, even the lower ones, hence the resonance; however individual souls keep their  individuality and are present to their bodies as “a whole at every point of the body”  (Ennead IV.9.1, 2).  While individual bodies eventually degrade and die, their  individual souls are eternal because they exist prior to time at the level of intelligible  matter.75   We have seen that for Plotinus proportion, order and harmony are the underlying  principles in the generation of the universe, and it was argued that Plotinus places these  proportions in Being as the ratios of the musical scale.  While the generation of the  universe is often referred to as a mathematical progression, it has also been argued that  this is intimately linked to the generation of musical scales which unfold in time.   Plotinus makes an analogy between the proportions in Intellect and art:    But if any artistic skill starts from the proportions of [individual] living  things and goes from there to consider the proportions of living things in  general, it would be a part of the power which also in the higher world  considers and contemplates universal proportion in the intelligible.  And  certainly all music, since the ideas which it has are concerned with  rhythm and melody, would be of the same kind, just like the art which is  concerned with intelligible number.  And as for the arts … for instance                                                                75  See: Ennead IV.7 ‘On the Immortality of the Soul’.  </p><div id="pagenum"><p>128</p></div><p id="page">120   building and carpentry, in so far as they make use of proportions they  would have their principles from the intelligible world. (V.9.11, 7-15)    Substance in the intelligible therefore orders the physical world according to proportion  or the ratios of musical harmonics.  Plotinus knows musical scales are determined by  harmonic ratios, and possibly influenced by Vitruvius who places great importance on  ancient Greek music theory for architectural design he may have also considered that  buildings were designed according to these ratios.76  Plotinus also suggests that  the  formula used in the production of sensible melodies is the same as that used for the  production of form in general:    The melodies in sounds too, the imperceptible ones, make the soul conscious of  beauty … showing the same thing in another medium.  It is proper to sensible  melodies to be measured by numbers, not according to any and every sort of  formula but one which serves for the production of form so that it may  dominate. ( Ennead I.6.3, 28-33)     In effect Plotinus is saying that since Intellect is beauty, these melodies exist in  Intellect; therefore, because form needs substantial number, substantial number must be  the numbers linked to melody.  This formula is therefore the foundation of musical  scales conceived as number, which has been suggested to be the numbers and harmonic  ratios found in ‘unified Being’, Plotinus’ version of the Pythagorean tetractys.    The subject of music in the Enneads has been a subject of debate amongst  Plotinian scholars and Panaiotidi has reviewed the conflicting positions in the literature  on Plotinus’ account of music, especially regarding its mimetic abilities.  While she  proposes that music theory is of particular importance to Plotinus, she also concludes  music has worth for Plotinus “only as a means of ascent to a higher reality, and this                                                                76  Chapter 1.2, p.17; Walden, 2014, p.126 and p.131. </p><div id="pagenum"><p>129</p></div><p id="page">121   capacity is grounded in its mathematical nature” (Panaiotidi, 2014, p.409).   The  importance of music in the ascent will be examined in Chapter 8; however, it is  contended that music also has worth for Plotinus in the descent as examined here, for it  is the measurable ratios found in nature that demonstrate the truth of the order within  Intellect and Being, and which dominate in the generation of the universe.  Plotinus  followed the Pythagoreans in proposing a philosophy founded on facts that he not only  considered universal and intelligible, but also observable in the physical world.  This brings us to the subject of music as metaphor in the Enneads, a subject that  Gersh has analysed in some detail.  He remarks there are “certain problems in Plotinus’  usage of such conceptual models”, due to the “nature of metaphoricity in general, since  the same term can fluctuate between a metaphorical and a non-metaphorical application  within even a restricted space of discourse”.  While he notes that Plotinus probably  would have been familiar with Nicomachus’ “ The Enchiridion ”, a work influenced by  Pythagorean harmonics, he also comments: “It is likely that Plotinus derived his  technique of using musical or harmonic similes and analogies to explain philosophical  concepts from the Pythagorean School of late antiquity”.  Gersh, however, suggests that  while Plotinus refers to the Timaeus most frequently, he excludes the harmonic  elements due to Plato’s ambiguous relation to harmonic theory.  He proposes that while  Plotinus has reservations about harmonics, this does not apply to his use of arithmetic  and geometry as explanatory devices.  He argues Plotinus restricts the use of musical  similes in two ways, and while the second concerns the “mode” of application, the first,  which is relevant to the argument presented here concerns the “range” of application:      The first restriction stems from the fact that harmonics works with ratios  whereas arithmetic works with numbers and ratios - which are inherently  relational and dual - are less compatible with ultimate monism.  This would  imply that harmonics would be a method more fitted to expressing aspects of </p><div id="pagenum"><p>130</p></div><p id="page">122   the lower and more multiple levels of reality than of the higher and more simple  levels. (Gersh, 2005, p.206).    The fact that Plotinus is more open about music theory in his account of Soul might  well lead one to agree with Gersh; however, Gersh, like other scholars who have  commented on the role of music in the Enneads, has not addressed the crucial issue of  how the generation of harmonics at the lower levels is wholly dependent on the  harmonic motion at work in Intellect.  The interpretation that Plotinus considers the  generation of Intellect and Soul as the generation of harmonics means Plotinus cannot  use musical metaphors at the higher levels because a metaphor can only be “applied to  an object or action to which it is not literally applicable”.77  The process itself is  literally applicable, hence his reliance on metaphors of light and vision to explain it.   Musical or harmonic similes and analogies may be used metaphorically at the lower  levels only because they mimic the higher levels.  Also, since an originating source of  energy, such as Plotinus’ One, is necessary for the generation of any harmonics, there is  no issue with it being incompatible with “ultimate monism”.  The question remains of  why Plotinus reverted to metaphors of light and vision at the higher levels when he  could have been more explicit about his intentions.  The reason is possibly linked to the  process of initiation as explained in Chapter 178 and the nature of the Pythagorean  influence that will be discussed in the final Conclusion of this work.   The Pythagorean influence is strong in Plotinus’s description of Soul; in fact,  there is very little difference between them.  Both propose a universe that is rationally  ordered according to number that pre-exists the universe itself; both propose the notion                                                                77  metaphor | Definition of metaphor in English by Oxford Dictionaries.

This is possible because, as noted in Chapter 279, there is a correspondence, but not  equivalence, between sensibility and intelligibility.  There is however a significant  difference in as much as Plotinus conceived the universe as a composite of soul and  body, which in turn is a composite of soul and matter, whereas the Pythagoreans  conceived the universe in terms of body and soul without making a distinction between  form and matter.  This brings us to the task of explaining the relevance of the harmonic  model in Plotinus’ conception of the origin, generation and function of matter, “the  mirror of Dionysus”.          4.4   The Nature and Origin of Matter  (ύλη)        In Ennead II.4.5, ‘On Matter’, Plotinus distinguishes between intelligible matter as  substantial number and form that acts as an archetype for physical matter; however,  Carroll suggests that Plotinus was never clear in his own mind about physical matter; in  fact Carroll refers to it as the “Plotinian albatross … that weighed most heavily upon  him” (Carroll, 2002, p.202).  Once again, the text is full of ambiguity as well as alleged  inconsistencies that have resulted in debate and disagreement amongst Plotinian  scholars, and O’Brien speculates that Plotinus’ lack of clarity is due to “the ‘oath of  silence’ to which Plotinus, Origen and Erennius bound themselves on the death of their                                                                79  Chapter 2.4, pp.56-57.  </p><div id="pagenum"><p>132</p></div><p id="page">124   common master, Ammonius” (O’Brien, 2012, p.76).  It will be proposed that a deeper  analysis of the text will reveal how the model of harmonics provides a solution that  accounts for matter’s origin, generation and nature.  However, before considering the  debate and the harmonics solution in more detail, it is pertinent to clarify Plotinus’  theory of matter in Ennead II.4, ‘On Matter’, Ennead III.6, ‘On Impassibility’ and  Ennead I.8, ‘On What are and Whence Come Evils’, the texts that commentators have  regarded as inconsistent.   In Ennead II.4.6-16, Plotinus argues against the atom theory of matter, claiming  that matter acts as a substrate for bodies and must therefore be different from them; it is  simple and has its own nature.  Matter is undefined because it is not form, and is  continuous, lacking the quality we perceive in sense objects, including colours,  temperature, weight, density, shape, size, quantity, magnitude or mass; however, as a  substrate for bodies it is submissive to everything and receptive of quality.  Matter is  necessary for bodies even though it is incorporeal, and he acknowledges its existence is  “apprehended by spurious reasoning”.  While he describes it as unlimited, Plotinus  explains that the unlimited also exists in Intellect, but it is different in as much as there  it is limited by bounds and orders.  Physical matter is the unlimited set in order, but it is  not limited nor is it limit.  Intelligible matter and physical matter differ as the archetype  differs from the image, but physical matter is more unlimited because it “escaped from  being and truth” ( Ennead II.4.15, 23-24), and therefore has less existence.  Both  intelligible matter and physical matter possess ‘otherness’ but in different forms; while  intelligible matter is ‘other’ than the One that is ‘beyond Being’, physical matter is  ‘other’ than Being (Ennead, II.4.1, 6) and hence is “privation” ( Ennead II.4.16, 3-5),  unreal and a potentiality of Being that can never be actualised ( Ennead II.5.2); it is  “lifeless” ( Ennead III.4.1,7) and “absolute indefiniteness” ( Ennead III.4.1,12).  In </p><div id="pagenum"><p>133</p></div><p id="page">125   Ennead III.6.7-11, matter is incorporeal, non-being, “a ghostly image of bulk”; “static  without being stable”; “a phantom”, invisible and what lies on it is a lie While it is  formless, it is unaffected by forms that appear on it, and indestructible.  Matter is  reflective like a mirror; however, unlike a mirror it is unseen.  It acts as a repellent base  and receptacle in which forms are concentrated on the outside.  Matter is unaffected by  the things seen it ( Ennead III.6.7, 13-44) and remains what it was from the beginning  (Ennead III.6.11, 18) and is evil because it is unaffected by the Good ( Ennead III.6.11,  44-46); however, despite this, matter is a gift of Providence because it is a necessary  cause of everything coming into being ( Ennead III.6.15, 27).   In Ennead I.8, Plotinus addresses the question of good and evil as opposites, and  as Armstrong comments:    The primary object of [this treatise] appears to be to provide a solid  metaphysical foundation for Plotinus’ moral teaching about the necessity of  purifying the soul by separating it from the material. (Armstrong, ‘Introductory  Note’ to Ennead I.8, p.276)    Plotinus argues that there is no evil in the Good but claims that evil is necessary; the  universe must be composed of opposing principles:    … it is necessary that what comes after the First should exist, and therefore that  the Last should exist; and this is matter. ( Ennead I.8.7, 21-22)     While Plotinus associates the One with the Good, he also suggests that absolute evil has  the same nature as physical matter:     … unmeasuredness in relation to measure, and unboundedness in relation to limit,  and formlessness in relation to formative principle, and neediness in relation to  what is self-sufficient; always undefined, nowhere stable, subject to every sort of  influence, insatiate, complete poverty.  ( Ennead I.8.3, 12-16)   </p><div id="pagenum"><p>134</p></div><p id="page">126   Rist therefore comments that “the doctrine of the relation between evil and matter  which can be found throughout the Enneads”, is “consistent” (Rist, 1961, p.166);  however the debate about Plotinus’ theory of matter appears to have three key and  interlinked themes: the first considers the origin and creation of matter, and the second  two, the nature of matter; specifically, if everything emanates from the One, which is  the ultimate Good, how could Plotinus regard matter as evil? And how could he  consider matter as ‘non-being’ whilst insisting that its existence is necessary?    Let us first consider the debate about the origin and creation of matter, which  arises because, as Majumdar notes, “it is anything but clear as to how matter itself  originates” (Majumdar, 2007, p.110).  She provides a helpful summary of the debate in  response to Carroll  (Majumdar, 2007, pp.112-113) who refers to three possible  positions adopted by commentators:     (i) Matter is independent of the One and opposed actively or passively to it; (ii)  matter is the end product of the procession from the One; and (iii) the question  of the origin of matter is meaningless since matter is nothing at all. (Carroll,  2002, p.181)     The view that matter is independent of the One is held by Bréhier and Pistorius who  effectively argue for a dualism, that matter is opposed actively or passively to the One.   While Bréhier suggests that matter participates in the Good and is independent of it,  Pistorius argues against its creation because of its status as the negation of Being.  (Bréhier, 1958, pp.174-181; Pistorius, 1952, p.68).  The view that matter is the end product of the procession from the One is a  monistic interpretation that appears to have the most support; however, theories of how  matter is generated vary.  Deck, Inge and Narbonne argue that matter is generated in  Intellect.  Deck refers to Ennead II.4.12, 8 where Plotinus states that Intellect is prior to </p><div id="pagenum"><p>135</p></div><p id="page">127   matter and to Ennead V.8.31, 7, where he states that matter is the last of the forms and  that all form is in Intellect or dependent on it (Deck, 1971, pp.103-104).  Inge argues  that matter was not created in time because it was necessary for soul to actualise its  interests, therefore it must have been created in Intellect (Inge, 1929, p. 137; p.144).   Narbonne rejects the notion that soul generates matter and favours the view that “matter  falls out or is expelled from the intelligible” (Narbonne, 2011, p. 43).  O’Brien suggests that matter was generated by the partial vegetative soul  because in Ennead III.4.1 Plotinus appears to suggest that soul is the origin of matter,  and in Ennead IV.3.9, that matter borders on Soul:  For soul has the power of growth… Does this power of growth, then, produce  nothing?  It produces a thing altogether different from itself; for after it there is  no more life, but what is produced is lifeless … absolute indefiniteness.  (Ennead III.4.1, 4-12)       Soul’s rest is, we may say, confirmed in absolute rest; a great light shines from  it and at the outermost edge of this firelight there is a darkness. Soul sees this  darkness and informs it, since it is there as a substrate for form.  For it was not  lawful for that which borders on soul to be without its share of formative  principle, as far as that was capable of receiving it, of which the phrase was  used “dimly in the dimness” which came to be. ( Ennead IV.3.9, 23-29)    While Carroll considers it a “remote possibility, if not impossibility” that the generator  of matter is soul (Carroll, 2002, p.199), he rejects the notion that Intellect generates  matter and suggests that we can consider it in terms of the causative power of the One  as described by Proclus on the basis that the One is ultimately the efficient and final  cause of everything ( Ennead IV.8.14, 20-33):      Thus, for Proclus, the causative power of the One extends to the whole  universe.  Everything in the universe including unformed and chaotic matter  derives its reality (or non-being) from the One.  The activity of Intelligence  does not reach down as far as The One’s precisely because it is not the primary </p><div id="pagenum"><p>136</p></div><p id="page">128   principle or causative power.  Intelligence does not generate matter.  This is  not to say, however, that Intelligence in no way affects matter.  It shapes it like  a potter shapes his clay, but as the potter does not cause clay to be clay.  Intelligence does not cause matter to be matter. (Carroll, 2002, pp.190-191)    This monistic interpretation is also shared by Armstrong (Armstrong, 1966, p.xxiv),  Dodds (Dodds, 1960, pp.21-22), Henry (Henry, 1960, pp.236-237) and Trouillard  (Trouillard, 1955, p.15).  The final view, that the question of the origin of matter is meaningless since  matter is nothing at all, is held by Carbonara (Carbonara, 1954), Murry (Murry, 1951,  p.234) and Katz (Katz, 1950, p.44) who argue against the dualistic and monistic  positions referred to above, claiming that matter is utter negation.  It therefore cannot  exist independently, nor be included in the generative process.  O’Brien challenges this  view by arguing that when Plotinus refers to the non-being or privation of matter he is  adapting “the paradoxical definition of a ‘form that is, of what is not’ in Plato’s Sophist  (258 D 5-7)”:80    ‘Otherness’ and all the ‘parts’ of otherness participate, as do all the forms, in  ‘being’ (the form), since otherwise there would not even ‘be’ a form of  otherness at all. The paradoxical conjunction of ‘being’ and ‘non-being’ arises  therefore when the part of otherness that participates in being is also opposed to  being. ‘The form that turns out to be, of what is not’ (258 D 6) is a form of  ‘what is not’, because it is the very part of otherness that is opposed to being,  but a form that nonetheless ‘turns out to be’, because even the very part of  otherness that is opposed to being cannot but participate in being. (O’Brien,  2012, p.31)                                                                  80  See also: Rist, 1961, p.156. </p><div id="pagenum"><p>137</p></div><p id="page">129   O’Brien therefore explains that to understand Plotinus we must make the distinction  between “‘non-being’ as a part of otherness and ‘non-being’ as sheer nothingness, as  non-existence” (O’Brien, 2012, p.42).81   Let us now consider how the harmonics model has the potential to provide a  coherent solution that accounts for matter’s origin, generation and nature.  In the  following explanation I refer to matter as ‘it’, acknowledging with O’Brien that while  matter is non-being this does not make it non-existent, even though Plotinus offers no  clarification of what matter is.   In Ennead V.8.7, 23, Plotinus refers to matter as “a sort of ultimate form”;  hence “this universe is all form, and all the things in it are forms” ( Ennead V.8.7, 24);  however, the ultimate form is infinite:  For as long as the division of a genus for instance, arrives at another form, it is  not yet infinite; for it is limited by the forms which have been generated; but the  ultimate form which is not divided into forms is more infinite. ( Ennead VI.2.22,  15-17)    Furthermore, he conceives of matter as a “flat surface”:    What it might have grasped … slips away from it as if from an alien nature, like  an echo from smooth flat surfaces. ( Ennead III.6.14, 26)       So, while matter is “a sort of form” it is not a form that has motion, shape or number,  and it is “unmeasure” because of its infinite and indefinite nature.  It is considered to be  “the primary evil” ( Ennead I.8.8, 37-38) because it lacks the perfection of the One as a  power to generate something other than itself; it merely acts as a substrate that reflects  the forms projected onto it as perceived images that divert the attention of the soul  away from the One.                                                                81  See also: O’Brien, 1996; O’Brien, 2014; Armstrong, Ennead I.8.3, note 3, pp.282-3.  </p><div id="pagenum"><p>138</p></div><p id="page">130    Plotinus used the lyre as an example of a vibrating string in his explanation of  sympathy and it is also a good example for understanding how the generation of matter  is consistent with the generation of harmonics.  Figure 12 (p.78) demonstrates that as  harmonics are generated from the fundamental vibration, the nodes increase in number  and the standing waves become progressively shorter, and while the illustration is  necessarily limited, if we think in terms of an infinite series, eventually a flat line is  generated within the fundamental when the distance between the nodes approaches  zero.  Similarly, if one presses on a vibrating string at every point it ceases to vibrate,  and a flat line is effectively created.  If the nodes are considered as places of rest where  no motion is perceived, the flat line must also be at rest; hence no movement, and no  power to generate offspring from itself.  The flat line is infinite as it has no  distinguishable nodes and therefore no substantial number, hence it is “unmeasure”.  It  is indefinite or unlimited because it has no boundary as does the nature of a specific  form.  Since it has no number it cannot be included in the Plotinian decad that is a unity  of otherness, sameness, motion and rest in Being82; therefore, it makes sense that  Plotinus considers it as non-being and irrational.  However, despite lacking motion,  matter does possess three of the four primary kinds; otherness because it is “otherness  in itself” ( Ennead II.4.13, 18) and is therefore other to otherness in Being; sameness  because it remains what it was from the beginning; it cannot be altered ( Ennead  III.6.10); and rest because it is lifeless ( Ennead III.4.1), hence Plotinus can claim:     Those who make the demand to abolish evil in the All are abolishing  providence itself. ( Ennead III.3.7, 6-7)                                                                  82  Chapter 3.5, pp.93-96. </p><div id="pagenum"><p>139</p></div><p id="page">131   While Plotinus does not consider matter to have a place in Being he does not eliminate  it entirely from Intellect because “all that is here below comes from there” ( Ennead  V.8.7, 17-18), and one can assume that “everything” includes matter, presumably  because all souls and matter are generated  in Intellect as its internal activity:    Intellect holds the soul which comes after it so that it is in number, and holds  soul down to its last part, but its last part is altogether infinite. ( Ennead  VI.2.22, 20-23)    This is consistent with the views of Rist and Inge who note Plotinus’ assertion that  matter is not generated as a temporal process:    In the early treatise 4.8, Plotinus mentions two theories current among the  Platonists concerning the origin of matter. Either matter has always existed, or its  generation is the necessary consequence of its causes which were "before" it  (4.8.6). The πρὸ αὐτῆς here certainly refers to the temporal creation of matter as  opposed to its eternal existence. It is quite certain that Plotinus' final view is that  matter exists eternally and is not in any sense a temporal creation. (Rist, 1961,  p.157)    If matter has eternal existence it may be argued that it is already present in Intellect as  its internal activity when the World Soul  contemplates the forms in Intellect and orders  the universe in temporal succession, and matter must be  contemplated prior to the  forms so that it may act as a substrate for the forms.  Plotinus refers to both intelligible matter and physical matter metaphorically as  “darkness”,83 and in Chapter 3,84 it was proposed that for Plotinus the “darkness” of  intelligible matter in its undefined radiation from the One is a metaphor for inaudible  sound, that is, sound as pure energy that will be broken up into sound waves or                                                                83  On the darkness of matter, see Deck, 1991, p.44 and O’Brien, 1996, p.182.  84  Chapter 3.2, pp.70-71. </p><div id="pagenum"><p>140</p></div><p id="page">132   vibrations in Intellect.  It seems reasonable to conclude that Plotinus conceives physical  matter as an image of intelligible darkness, and therefore a metaphor for sound as  phenomenal experience.  As Plotinus says, it’s “like an echo from smooth flat surfaces”  (Ennead III.6.14, 26).  We do not perceive physical matter itself, only the forms or  vibrations reflected by it, and we are able to do so because we are in sympathetic  resonance with them.  Since the Pythagoreans made no distinction between form and  matter, Plotinus follows Plato in realising the necessity for a reflective surface so that  images arise in perception.  The images that we perceive as physical reality are not in  matter but formed by the faculty of imagination each soul possesses.  This will be  examined in more detail in Chapter 8.   The interpretation based on the harmonics model brings us no closer to  understanding what matter is; however it concurs with the monistic view.  The One is  ultimately the cause of all things by the gift of its power; however, it is Intellect,  considered as the ‘fundamental’ which begins the harmonic series that culminates in  matter, simply as a result of its continual halt and turning towards the One in its desire  for the Good.  If matter originates in Intellect it cannot be independent of it as proposed  by Bréhier and Pistorius, and while Carroll is mistaken to reject the notion that Intellect  generates matter, he is right to suggest that we can consider matter in terms of the  causative power of the One as described by Proclus on the basis that the One is  ultimately the efficient and final cause of everything ( Ennead VI.8.14, 20-33).  Matter  cannot be the end product of the procession from the One if considered as a distinct  entity that follows the generation of Intellect and Soul as Hypostases , and as a substrate  for the forms its origin cannot be considered meaningless because matter is nothing or  non-existent.  Narbonne is correct to reject the notion that Soul generates matter if  considered as Intellect’s external activity; however, it could be argued that Soul </p><div id="pagenum"><p>141</p></div><p id="page">133   generates matter as harmonics in the process of Intellect’s  internal activity.  Matter  cannot be expelled from Intellect, nor does it simply fall out of Intellect since it must be  contemplated by the World Soul.   Similarly, the harmonics model does not concur with  O’Brien’s theory that the partial or vegetative soul, generates matter as its external  activity.  It is therefore proposed that physical matter never was an “albatross” carried  by Plotinus because his metaphysics is modelled on a theory of harmonic generation,  which concurs with the text and explains its origin, generation and nature.        Conclusion        This Chapter argues that the harmonic model and Pythagorean influence is operational  at every stage in the procession from the One and resolves difficulties perceived by  commentators concerning Plotinus’ ambiguity about the various levels of Soul in  general and the origin and nature of matter .  It clarifies the various levels of Soul,  challenges the view that the Hypostasis Soul  is a rational form, and explains how  Plotinus could conceive of  World Soul  as the eldest.  It explains how each primary Soul  form generates its own offspring as an infinite series and why Plotinus conceived them  as being expressed one after another in temporal succession as in a musical scale or  melody.    The examination of the characteristics of the World Soul  and individual souls,  together with their association explained how Plotinus utilised the Pythagorean  concepts of harmonia  and sympathia , and it was speculated that Plotinus’ concept of  synesis is similar to the a priori innate musical intuition as proposed by Aristoxenus  and that this may have been an epistemological influence on him.  These concepts are  intimately linked to, ultimately depend on, and therefore support the model of </p><div id="pagenum"><p>142</p></div><p id="page">134   harmonics proposed in Chapter 3.  It was suggested that the view held by some  commentators, that Plotinus’ primary influence was the Stoic concept of sympathia,   requires re-evaluation because the Pythagorean interpretation is more compatible with  his theory.   Disagreements amongst scholars concerning the role of music and musical  metaphors in the Enneads were noted, and it was suggested they arise because of a  failure to comprehend that harmonics are generated in Intellect.  It was therefore  proposed that the Pythagorean influence on Plotinus has been misunderstood and  underemphasised in his theory of Soul, because other than their respective theories of  matter, there is little to separate them.  The examination of the generation of multiplicity in the Enneads concluded with  an examination of how Plotinus conceives the nature and origin of physical matter,  noting again differences of interpretation among commentators, because they perceived  a lack of clarity in Plotinus.  It was argued that as harmonics are generated from the  fundamental as an infinite series, the nodes increase in number while the standing  waves become progressively shorter, thus generating a flat line that is at rest as the  distance between the nodes approaches zero.  It conforms to Plotinus’ assertion that  matter is “a sort of form” having its origin in Intellect.  Its lack of movement means it  has no power to generate anything; hence  matter acts as substrate for the forms which  Plotinus conceives as a reflective surface, just as matter acts as a reflective surface onto  which sound waves are projected to produce sound that is perceived.  While the model  of harmonics accounts for the generation of matter and for why physical matter does  not exist in Being but is necessary for the making of the universe,  it does not explain  what matter is. </p><div id="pagenum"><p>143</p></div><p id="page">135   It is proposed that the model of harmonics adopted by Plotinus together with the  influence of the Pythagorean tradition was understood by Bergson and contributed to  the incorporation of Pythagorean features into his metaphysics, though like Plotinus he  does not always make them explicit in the text.  This will therefore be explored in the  next Chapter.                                            </p><div id="pagenum"><p>144</p></div><p id="page">136   Chapter 5    Bergson - God, the Élan Vital  and the Generation of Multiplicity    *      Introduction        This Chapter presents the argument that, like Plotinus, Bergson models his cosmology  on the physics of sound and music theory, and explains how Bergson’s generation of  multiplicity, or ‘creative evolution’, is what Mossé-Bastide refers to as a “dynamic  schema” that is “rooted in the philosophy of Plotinus” (Mossé-Bastide, 1959, p.355).      It sets the stage for Chapter 6 in which it will be argued that Bergson’s philosophy of  transformation is influenced by Pythagoreanism.    In Creative Evolution  Bergson traces unorganised matter and all forms of life  back to God and the élan vital .  His conflation of these concepts meant his cosmology  was deemed obscure when Creative Evolution  was published, and even though he later  attempted to clarify himself in  The Two Sources of Morality and Religion ,  commentators still consider these concepts ambiguous.  It will be argued that Bergson  followed Plotinus and the Pythagoreans in presenting a non-pantheist philosophy in  which the First Principle remains independent but present within its progeny.  The generation of multiplicity as presented in Creative Evolution  is also  considered mysterious by commentators due to Bergson’s reliance on metaphor to  explain it; however, it will be clarified, with the use of illustrations, how Bergson  follows Plotinus in adopting harmonic motion as the mechanism of the élan vital  that  generates itself as an impersonal supra-consciousness, thus replicating Plotinus’  generation of the ‘form’ Intellect as the first harmonic.  This will be followed by an </p><div id="pagenum"><p>145</p></div><p id="page">137   explanation of the ontological and epistemological transformation of the élan vital as it  divides into matter and consciousness as separate tendencies, according to the model of  harmonics.  It will be argued that while Bergson uses novel concepts, the underlying  ontological and corresponding epistemological structure of his philosophy basically  replicates Plotinus but differs from him because he synthesises Intellect and Soul into  the function of a supra-consciousness generating the vital and geometrical orders in a  wholly temporal process.  The focus on harmonics in this Chapter means that any  potential influence of French Spiritualism on his cosmology has not been examined.           5.1   Bergson’s Principle of Unity - God/ Élan Vital        Bergson’s concept of unity is encompassed within his concepts of duration, the élan  vital and God.  He always denied his philosophy was systematic because he considered  it a work of collaboration open to further development, and as such his earlier works  intentionally avoided the notion of a First Principle; however, it will be argued that  Bergson followed the Pythagoreans and Plotinus by advocating a philosophy that can be  categorised as panentheism.  Duration was the concept introduced in Time and Free Will  and is the  fundamental concept underlying all his work.  Duration is an indivisible and continuous  multiplicity of interpenetrating heterogeneous and qualitative psychic states, and whose  nature is a ‘one-many’ temporal unity of direction because it prolongs the past into the  present and the present into the future (‘Introduction to Metaphysics’ in C.M. p.165).85   For Bergson, duration cannot be viewed from the perspective of unity or multiplicity                                                                85  See also: ‘Introduction to Metaphysics’, in C.M., pp.168-176 </p><div id="pagenum"><p>146</p></div><p id="page">138   without resorting to ready-made concepts, the analysis of which fails to capture duration  in its essence, and in Matter and Memory , he aimed to “to lessen greatly, if not to  overcome, the theoretical difficulties that have always beset dualism”  by uniting mind  and matter under the umbrella of duration or consciousness, despite referring to the  theory as “frankly dualistic” (M.M., p.vii).  His task in Creative Evolution  is to explain  the élan vital as a ‘one-many’ durational, creative and productive impulse or power  implicit in the  evolutionary process of life; hence it is “the principle of all life, as also of  all materiality” (C.E., p.238).  Furthermore, he introduces the notion of the élan vital  as  “supra-consciousness” that is “pure creative activity” (C.E., p.245) and “the origin of  life” (C.E., p. 261).  For the first time he briefly introduces the link between the élan  vital and God:    God, thus defined, has nothing of the already made; He is unceasing life,  action, freedom.  Creation, so conceived, is not a mystery; we experience it in  ourselves when we act freely. (C.E., p.248)    The God of Creative Evolution  does not appear to be a transcendent first cause as is  Plotinus’ One, but the élan vital  itself as supra-consciousness, defined during the  course of its life.  Creative Evolution  was therefore the source of much debate about  Bergson’s concept of God being immanent in the world, because he chose not to clarify  his position, commenting that “Everything is obscure in the idea of creation if we think  of things which are created and a thing which creates”  (C.E., p.248).  There is within  the élan the need to live and know, and like Plotinus, Bergson thinks the “theory of  knowledge and theory of life are inseparable” (C.E., p.xiii) because “the act of knowing  coincides with the act generating reality” ( Mélanges , p.774).  For Bergson, mind and  matter are opposing tendencies conceived as two aspects of the élan vital , co-existing  as an undifferentiated unity that is “an immensity of potentiality” (C.E., p.258 and </p><div id="pagenum"><p>147</p></div><p id="page">139   p.269); therefore, as God appears to be dependent on matter for its existence,  commentators accused him of failing to account for the genesis of matter,86  unsurprisingly prompting multiple accusations of pantheism.  Bergson was adamant he  had been misunderstood, and in 1908 following a critical article by Tonquédec,  published in Etudes, he replied to him by letter.  He stated that in Creative Evolution ,  he refers to God as being the source from which two élans develop alternately; God is  therefore distinct from them, and as such, we cannot say it comes to a sudden end or  that it is at the mercy of the materiality that it had to give itself.  Furthermore, he  suggested his refutation of the idea of “nothing” is not to deny a transcendent source,  but to assert something has always existed ( Mélanges  pp.766-767).87  In Creative  Evolution , Bergson develops Plotinus’ argument that space, or place is not prior to the  One, claiming that because all action is geared towards “creating something that does  not yet exist” (C.E., p. 273) the mind habitually forms the idea that something comes  from nothing and due to the intellect’s tendency to spatialise, “being is superimposed  on nothing” (C.E., p. 276); hence philosophies that prioritise nothing over ‘being’.   Whereas we tend to think there is less in the idea of nothing, than in the idea of  something, in fact, by making it non-existent we automatically add existence to it;  hence there is more in the idea of nothing than the idea of something.  For Bergson the  idea of nothing is an illusion of our understanding because we are always conscious of  something, whether it is outside of us or within.  “A suppression of everything is never                                                                86  Mullarkey, 2000, pp. 80-82. Mullarkey notes that the origin of matter is “ambiguous” in       Bergson: “Matter is sometimes opposed to life, sometimes to ‘spirit’ or consciousness and  sometimes to the élan vital (the latter four being made equivalent).  Alternatively, life is also  regarded as a primitive, holding matter and spirit as potential forms within itself.”    87  «Je parle de Dieu (pp.268-272 de l’ Évolution créatrice ) comme de la source d’où sortent       tour à tour, par un effet de sa liberté, les « courants » ou « élans » dont chacun formera un       monde : il en reste donc distinct, et ce n’est pas de lui qu’on peut dire que « le plus souvent il       tourne court », ou qu’il soit « à la merci de la matérialité qu’il a du se donner ».   </p><div id="pagenum"><p>148</p></div><p id="page">140   formed by thought” (C.E., p.279).  As soon as we try to annihilate an idea we affirm its  real or possible existence.  In effect he is suggesting that when ‘thinking’ “not-being is  not” it entails that “not-being is”, though the view that a negative existential claim  entails the existence of its referent can certainly be challenged.  Like Plotinus, he also  refutes the idea of the first principle having a purely logical existence, because an  axiom or definition as per Spinoza or Leibniz has no independent physical or  psychological existence, thus leaving no room for freedom within efficient causality  (C.E., pp.275-298).  Efficient causality is essentially the creation of novelty, and like  Plotinus, the first principle is ultimately free because everything that follows is  dependent upon it as the primary and efficient cause.88  For Bergson then, there must be  an independent transcendent cause, and whilst in his reply to Tonquédec he  acknowledged that he failed to convey its nature in Creative Evolution , he also denies  stating that it is the world itself, because the book “explicitly affirms the contrary”  (Mélanges , pp.766-767).  In his Huxley Lecture on ‘Life and Consciousness’, delivered to the University of  Birmingham in May 1911, Bergson states: “We may surmise that these two realities,  matter and consciousness, are derived from a common source” but neither can be  explained apart from the other (M. E., p.23), and in January 1912, Tonquédec published  an article entitled ‘M. Bergson est-il moniste?’ (Tonquédec, 1912, p.296), prompting  Bergson to strongly refute any accusation of monism or pantheism.  Bergson argued  that his work leading up to Creative Evolution clearly points to the idea of God as a  creator, freely generating both matter and life, but whose creative effort is continued in  the realm of life by the evolution of species and the constitution of human personalities.   Bergson suggested that an investigation of moral problems would be necessary to                                                                88  The concept of freedom will be examined in Chapters 8 (Plotinus) and 9 (Bergson) </p><div id="pagenum"><p>149</p></div><p id="page">141   develop these conclusions more precisely ( Mélanges , pp.963-964).  His position was  further clarified by H. Wildon Carr, whose translation of the book Mind-Energy , a  compilation of Bergson’s lectures and essays, was authorised and approved by Bergson  and published in 1920.  In his ‘Introduction’ he states:    But although the term Mind-Energy does not, and is not intended to, imply a  physical concept of mind, yet it is meant to imply, and does depend upon, a  metaphysical concept.  Mind is not a vis vitae convertible into vis inertiae .   Equally impossible is it to conceive an ultimate dualism, - mind and matter as  the co-existence of two independent realms of reality.  Mind and matter are  divergent tendencies; they point to an original and necessary dichotomy; they  are opposite in direction; but they are mutually complementary and imply the  unity of an original impulse. (M.E., ‘Introduction’, p.vii)      It was not until 1932 that Bergson developed the theme of evolution within a  moral, religious and therefore social context in  The Two Sources of Morality and  Religion and clarified his thoughts on the nature of God in his investigation of mystical  experience, claiming the mystic reveals the origin of the élan vital  as God.  He remains  undecided as to whether the élan vital is God or God’s effort to create:    In our eyes, the ultimate end of mysticism is the establishment of a contact,  consequently of a partial coincidence, with the creative effort which life itself  manifests.  This effort is of God, if it is not God himself. (T.S.M.R., p.220)     What should we make of this?  If God is the creative effort, life manifests God; and if  the creative effort is of God, life manifests God’s creative effort, and therefore God is  distinct from his creative effort and hence life.  The difficulty is exacerbated because  Bergson often equates the vital impulse with life.  Furthermore, “The vital impulse is a  creative emotion” (T.S.M.R., p.95) and “Creative energy is to be defined as love”  (T.S.M.R., p.257), but “Divine love is not a thing of God; it is God himself” (T.S.M.R., </p><div id="pagenum"><p>150</p></div><p id="page">142   p.252).  From this we can deduce that the vital impulse is the creative emotion defined  as love which is God.  God is the vital impulse, i.e. life, and therefore is not distinct  from it.  Accusations of pantheism and monism therefore continued even after  publication of The Two Sources of Morality and Religion .  Mossé-Bastide suggests we  must eliminate the concept of substance monism from Bergson because “there is no  substance in Bergsonism”, referring to Creative Evolution  in which he states: "there are  no things, only actions" (Mossé-Bastide, 1959, pp.354-355).89  This will be  demonstrated in the explanation of the ontological and epistemological transformation  of the élan vital .90   There is a second aspect to God in the Two Sources ; God is distinct from beings  (T.S.M.R., p.257) but acts through the soul of the mystic, supplying a  “superabundance” of energy that “flows from the spring which is the very source of  life” (T.S.M.R., p.232); “God is this energy itself”, and God’s nature is “an energy to  which no limit can be assigned, and a power of creating and loving that surpasses all  imagination” (T.S.M.R., p.262).  Finally, we distinctly hear the echo of Plotinus’ One; a  God with a superabundance of energy that flows like a spring, which appears to be  different to the élan vital  of Creative Evolution  that he refers to as an “explosive force”  that is given once and for all (C.E., p.98).  There is however an important difference  between Bergson’s God and Plotinus’ One; whereas the One of Plotinus is self- sufficient, Bergson’s God in the Two Sources  is needy.  He does not propose teleology  in terms of predetermined design with a final purpose but supports a partial teleology in  that God has an impulse, or a “need”, to reproduce and evolve in a form that requires a  freely chosen process of change, creation and growth. “God needs us, just as we need                                                                89  See: ‘Philosophical Intuition’, in C.M., p.127 and ‘Perception of Change’, in C.M., p.148.  90  Section 5.3, p.157. </p><div id="pagenum"><p>151</p></div><p id="page">143   God.  Why should He need us unless it be to love us?” (T.S.M.R., p.255).  This need is  expressed in life’s most fully evolved form, man, operating through the motives of love  and ambition:      …he who is sure, absolutely sure, of having produced a work which will endure  and live, cares no more for praise and feels above glory, because he is a creator,  because he knows it, because the joy he feels is the joy of a god. (M.E., p.30)    Merleau-Ponty captures the essence of this aspect of Bergson’s God in The Two  Sources:    It is the doubling of nature into an irreconcilable natura naturans  and natura  naturata which in the Two Sources  actualizes the distinction between God and  his action upon the world that remained virtual in the previous works.  It is true  that Bergson does not say Deus sive Natura , but the reason why he does not is  that God is a different nature.  At the very moment he definitively disengages  the “transcendent cause” from its “terrestrial delegation”, it is still the word  nature which falls from his pen.  From this point forward, all that was truly  active and creative in the world is concentrated in God, and the world ends up  as nothing but a “stopping point” or “created thing”. (Merleau-Ponty, 1964, p.  189)      Mossé-Bastide makes the point that as it is the key element in Bergson’s philosophy we  can take duration in two ways, either as an evolution of unpredictable novelty, even for  God, or “as the creation of a kind of dynamic schema of creative emotion that reigns,  one and indivisible throughout its deployment”.  She continues:      It is this second interpretation, directly derived from the philosophy of Plotinus,  which appears to us to be true. …  The last word is always Bergsonian duration,  but a duration that is rooted in the philosophy of Plotinus. (Mossé-Bastide,  1959, p.355)   </p><div id="pagenum"><p>152</p></div><p id="page">144   In stating that Bergson’s duration is rooted in the philosophy of Plotinus, Mossé-Bastide  notes that Bergson is more specifically influenced by the durational nature of Plotinus’  concept of the World Soul  that constantly changes whilst retaining its identity, and she  points to The Two Sources of Morality and Religion where Bergson refers to the  difference between materiality and divine spirituality as “the distinction between being  created and creating, between the multifarious notes, strung like pearls of a symphony  and the indivisible emotion from which they sprang” (T.S.M.R., p. 256).  Since Bergson denied that his philosophy is pantheistic because God as creator  remains distinct from its creations, it is suggested that it can be placed in the category of  panentheism , which is defined as the view that God is in all things, but not identical to  all things (Audi, 2005, p.640).  The philosophy of Plotinus as well as other Neoplatonists was also interpreted as  pantheism by the Catholic Church in the late nineteenth century.  In John Hunt’s book  Pantheism and Christianity  (1884) he refers to the whole of Greek philosophy,  including Neoplatonism, under the heading of Pantheism.91  While there is little  disagreement about the separate identity of the One in the emanation process or descent,  the debate around Plotinus’ theism largely centres around the mystical union of the soul  with the One, and there appear to be three positions taken by commentators: the first is  theistic union (Rist, 1977; 1989); the second, monistic identity (Bréhier, 1958; Hadot,  1986; Hatab; 1982; Irwin, 1989; Mamo, 1976), and the third argues for a mystical union  that is mediated epistemologically by Intellect (Arp, 2004;  Inge, 1929; Merlan, 1963;   Katz, 1978).  Rist makes the distinction between the first two positions as follows:                                                                  91  Hunt, 1884.  Plotinus is specifically addressed on pp.89-96.      </p><div id="pagenum"><p>153</p></div><p id="page">145   By "theistic mysticism" I refer to the explanation of mystical experiences in  terms of the union of the soul with a transcendent being: the theistic mystic  insists that despite his experience of union, the soul and that transcendent being  cannot "ultimately," or "in the last resort," be identical.  By a "monistic"  explanation I mean an explanation given by a man who believes that he is  "ultimately" identical with God, the One, the Absolute, or whatever such name  he gives to the first cause of the universe.  (Rist, 1989, p.184)    Arp argues that while both camps believe that the noetic part of the soul is transcended  in mystical union itself whilst retaining its identity, there is a difference between the  ontological and epistemological perspective.  While the One retains its ontological  distinctness, epistemologically Plotinus equates the One with Intellect:    … there seems to be reluctance on Plotinus's part wholly to divorce the activity  of Nous from the One.  (Arp, 2004, p.157)     While the “monistic identity” interpretation would place Plotinus within the  category of pantheism, that God is identical with all things, the view that Plotinus was a  pantheist is rejected by most modern commentators on Plotinus.  Armstrong for  example, writes:    It is…the sharp differentiation between the human soul or self, with its power of  realizing its unity with the Supreme, and the separation of the visible cosmos,  which most clearly makes it impossible to call Plotinus a pantheist, or to  exaggerate the importance of the doctrine of the Infinite Self.  (Armstrong,  2013, p.43)     Rist’s theistic mysticism is compatible with panentheism , the view that God is in all  things, but not identical to all things, and Cooper comments that since Plotinus makes  “clear ontological distinctions” between the One, Intellect and Soul, it is a case of  “classical panentheism” (Cooper, 2007, pp.42-43). </p><div id="pagenum"><p>154</p></div><p id="page">146   The third position, which acknowledges the ontological distinctness of the One  but argues for epistemological union, leaves a question mark over the nature of  Plotinus’ theism.   In his early career, Bergson appears to consider the subject solely from an  ontological perspective and held a pantheistic view of Neoplatonism, whilst rejecting  Pythagoreanism as pantheistic.  In his lecture on ‘The Pythagoreans’ delivered at the  Université de Clermont-Ferrand between 1884 and 1885, he rejects the emergence of  multiplicity from an original unity as being Pythagorean; instead he links it to the later  philosophy of the Neopythagoreans and Neoplatonists:    According to the Neopythagoreans and the Neoplatonists, Pythagoras would  have identified the One with Divinity. … It is certain that the Pythagoreans  recognised multiple gods, while following to a certain extent the direction of  monotheism, which was so important in philosophy starting from Xenophanes.   We therefore reject it as being like a neo-Platonic theory, the idea of the  development of God in the world, of a division, an emanation of the original  unity giving birth to the oppositions of the one and the many. This is a  pantheistic theory which the Pythagoreans probably never considered. (Hude,  2000, p. 187)92    In note 54 of Bergson’s lecture, Hude comments: “Bergson never varies in his  opposition to this kind of representation and of pantheism in general” (Hude, 2000, p.  274).93  It is suggested that Bergson fails to make the distinction between pantheism and  panentheism , and as discussed above, the issue is one of identity.  It was explained in  Chapter 3 that the Pythagoreans, Neopythagoreans and Neoplatonists considered the  original unity (the One) to be prior to number and not identical to it.  The One is the  One, not the One-many, which is for Plotinus the second Hypostasis, Intellect, (Ennead                                                                92  Appendix 2, p. 7  93  Appendix 2, p.11 </p><div id="pagenum"><p>155</p></div><p id="page">147   V.4.1, 23) or the ‘one and many’ which is Soul (Ennead VI.9.1, 39).  If pantheism is the  view that God is identical with all things, and panentheism  is the view that God is in all  things, but not identical to all things, then Bergson was mistaken; the Neopythagoreans  and Neoplatonists were not pantheists.  This view is accepted by most modern  commentators on Plotinus.  Armstrong for example writes:    It is…the sharp differentiation between the human soul or self, with its power of  realizing its unity with the Supreme, and the separation of the visible cosmos,  which most clearly makes it impossible to call Plotinus a pantheist, or to  exaggerate the importance of the doctrine of the Infinite Self.  (Armstrong,  2013, p.43)94    If we consider that Bergson’s Pythagorean lecture was given in the early days of his  philosophical studies, I think we can accept it as a simple misunderstanding that he later  corrected, because he amended his views regarding Plotinus.  In his ‘Lectures on  Plotinus’, presented at the École Normale Supérieure between 1898 and 1899, he states:  “If the system seems to demand a pantheistic derivation, Plotinus expresses himself in  terms which exclude this derivation” (Hude, 2000, p.63).95  So, for Bergson, the  Pythagoreans and Plotinus ultimately present a non-pantheist philosophy in which the  First Principle remains distinct from but present within its products; a position that is  fully in accordance with his own, even though it took many years for him to clarify it.  It is possible that the Pythagorean influence can be found more directly in  Bergson in some of the metaphors he uses, for example, he refers to the élan vital  as the  “breath of life” (C.E. p.100; T.S.M.R., pp.11, 134, 311 and 312), and while this could                                                                94  See also: Rist, 1977, p.216; Copleston, 1993, p.467; Corrigan, 2005, pp.185-6  95  Appendix 4, p. 40 </p><div id="pagenum"><p>156</p></div><p id="page">148   simply be referring to the Bible, Genesis 2.7,96 it could be the breath of life associated  with Pythagoreanism.  It must be remembered that Bergson’s primary source of  information on the Pythagoreans was Aristotle and Boutroux’s translation of Zeller’s  Die Philosophie der Griechen in ihrer geschichtlichen Entwicklung .  Kahn refers to  Aristotle, Physics IV, 6, 213b 22, and comments, for the Pythagoreans:     Cosmogony begins as the numbers are generated, when the Unlimited is drawn  in (or “breathed in”) by the limiting principle.  Thus the cosmos arises from the  One by breathing, like a newborn animal. (Kahn, 2001, p.29)    Zhmud claims that this idea arises in sixth century natural philosophy, but it is  incompatible with Philolaus’ concepts of limiting and unlimited that are united by  cosmic harmony (Zhmud, 1998, p.6).  Zeller also rejected the notion of a breathing  cosmos as being Pythagorean (Zeller, 1881, p.473); however, we must consider Hude’s  comment: “Bergson uses Zeller as a template and builds his bibliographic information  on it; that does not mean that he simply repeats Zeller and works second-hand” (Hude,  2000, pp.11, note 5).  The evidence suggests we can only speculate on Bergson’s  ‘breath of life’ as having a Pythagorean origin; however, there is another possible  Pythagorean link when he links his God metaphorically with “fire”.  He claims it is by  studying the lives of the mystics and striving to experience what they experience, that  we may penetrate by an act of intuition to the life principle itself:    To pierce the mystery of the deep, it is sometimes necessary to regard the  heights.  It is earth’s hidden fire  [my emphasis] which appears at the summit of  the volcano. (‘Life and Consciousness’, in M.E., p.32)                                                                  96  “And the LORD God formed man of the dust of the ground, and breathed into his nostrils  the breath of life; and man became a living soul.”   </p><div id="pagenum"><p>157</p></div><p id="page">149   It is not unreasonable to link it to the ‘central fire’ of Philolaus if we consider the other  similarities in their first principle, as well as the appearance of other Pythagorean  metaphors in his work.97   It is suggested that the Pythagoreans, Plotinus and Bergson can be placed in the  category of panentheism  providing Plotinus was correct in interpreting the Pythagorean  Monad from a Platonic perspective; although for the purpose of determining the  Pythagorean influence on Plotinus, his accuracy on this point is irrelevant.   Significantly, they all propose the unity of a first principle that remains distinct from,  but active within, its products.   The next stage in understanding the generation of multiplicity in Bergson is to  establish the nature of the mechanism of the élan vital and hence duration.           5.2.   The Nature and Mechanism of the Élan Vital        Bergson follows Plotinus in adopting a ‘top-down’ approach where God functions, as  does Plotinus’ One, as the energy source for the generative process, and for Bergson  the élan vital functions as does the radiation from the One, as the form of  superabundant energy that unceasingly creates a continuous or “uninterrupted upsurge  of novelty” (‘Introduction I’, in C.M., p.18).   However, even renowned Bergson  scholars have found Bergson’s cosmology problematical and have failed to understand  and therefore explain it as being a logical process.  The tendency is to either repeat  what Bergson says in his texts, ignore it entirely because of its perceived obscurity, or  acknowledge the overriding mystery surrounding it; Keith Ansell Pearson, for example,                                                                97  These will be discussed in Chapter 6.   </p><div id="pagenum"><p>158</p></div><p id="page">150   refers to the operation of the élan vital as “a mysterious conception … which is  ultimately based on a hylomorphic model” (Ansell Pearson, 2006, p.158).  The  generation of multiplicity as matter and form in Bergson therefore demands an  explanation.  While the élan vital  is analogous to the radiation from the One because it contains  an undifferentiated multiplicity, for Bergson consciousness98 and matter are pre- requisites for existence. In Matter and Memory  he proposed:    existence …  appears to imply two conditions taken together: (1) presentation in  consciousness; and (2) the logical or causal connection of that which is so  presented with what precedes and with what follows. (M.M., p.189)    Hence, we find in all Bergson’s works that the generation of novelty requires the  interaction of two opposing but complementary tendencies, described in The Two  Sources of Morality and Religion  as being formed according to the “law of dichotomy”:     Now we must not make exaggerated use of the word "law" in a field which is  that of liberty, but we may use this convenient term when we are confronted  with important facts which show sufficient regularity.  So we will call law of  dichotomy that law which apparently brings about a materialization, by a mere  splitting up, of tendencies which began by being two photographic views, so to  speak, of one and the same tendency. (T.S.M.R, p.296)    This passage emphasises “regularity” in the process, and in Creative Evolution  Bergson  states that duration, multiplicity, the universe and organic life within it “is a kind of  mechanism”, and a mechanism of the whole (C.E., p.31; p.263).  Mullarkey comments  that it is a “movement” that is ordered, rather than “the mechanism of parts artificially                                                                98  It must be clarified that for Bergson consciousness or mind is not a state of the brain, which      he refers to as the ‘organ of attention to life’; the function of the brain is to direct mental life      into bodily movement or ‘efficacious action’ (‘The Soul and the Body’, in M.E., pp.37-74).      The élan vital  does not possess a brain, and its function has no practical utility.  </p><div id="pagenum"><p>159</p></div><p id="page">151   isolated within the whole universe” (Mullarkey, 2000, p.74).  This idea underlies  Bergson’s assertion that there is no disorder, just orders of a different kind; order in  time and order in space.  The necessity of order is noted by Lorend:    Bergson does not explicitly state it, but necessity is an important characteristic  of order in two senses: 1) …, that the existence of some kind of order is  necessary; 2) in the sense that although no particular order is necessary in itself,  every order constitutes necessities. (Lorend, 1992, p.580)    Bergson considers the notion of ‘disorder’, like the notion of ‘nothing’, to be the cause  of unresolvable problems of knowledge;  disorder is:    the disappointment of a mind that finds before it an order different from what  it wants, an order with which it is not concerned at the moment, and which, in  this sense, does not exist for it …it represents nothing at all … reality is  ordered exactly to the degree to which it satisfies our thought. (C.E., pp.222- 223)    Hence, for Bergson there are two kinds of order and two modes of thinking them: the  dynamic order is thought by intuition in time or duration, and the static order by  intellect in space.  While Mullarkey notes Bergson’s ambiguity about the genesis of matter  (Mullarkey, 2000, p.82), he suggests that William E. May provides the definitive  analysis on the subject:    …, the élan precontains both consciousness and matter as interpenetrating  virtualities, and it gives rise to both in the course of its actualisation, in the  course of giving rise to what is other than itself. (May, 1970, p.634)     May’s comment that the élan gives ‘rise to what is other than itself’ refers to Bergson’s  concept of unity as one-many.  In the sense that the élan is one it is always itself and </p><div id="pagenum"><p>160</p></div><p id="page">152   therefore is always the same, and in the sense that the élan is many, a heterogeneous  multiplicity, it is other than itself.  This is replicated in our own psychical life in which  we find a unity that is at the same time a continuity of temporal variation: “a moving  continuity is given to us, in which everything changes and yet remains the same”  (M.M, p.260).   In Creative Evolution  Bergson states:    there is no essential difference between passing from one state to another and  persisting in the same state.  If the state which remains the same is more varied  than we think, on the other hand the passing from one state to another  resembles, more than we imagine, a single state prolonged; the transition is  continuous. (C.E, p.248)    In his account of continuous transformation Bergson therefore conflates identity and  changes of state by proposing that there is identity in difference.  The original élan has  same and other as potential tendencies that are unified within it; however, the passing  from one state to another also implies movement  and rest, terms that describe  consciousness and matter respectively as both possessing dual aspects that are static  and dynamic.  As opposing features of the complementary tendencies within the  original élan, Bergson’s concepts of same, other, motion and rest fulfil the same  function as Plotinus’ primary kinds, the unified potentialities within the indefinite dyad  and as actualities in Being.99    Let us return to the mechanism that is implicit in the generation of multiplicity.   In The Two Sources of Morality and Religion  God is the originating source of the  energy of the élan vital  supplying, as it is required, a “superabundance” of energy  (T.S.M.R., p.232), analogous to the radiation of Plotinus’ One.  The generation of  multiplicity therefore begins with a source of power, and in Creative Evolution  Bergson                                                                99  Chapter 3.2, p.67.  </p><div id="pagenum"><p>161</p></div><p id="page">153   refers to initial movement is an “explosive force”, given once and for all, and that it is  created “due to an unstable balance of tendencies – which life bears within itself” (C.E.,  p.98).  He uses a number of metaphors to explain the initial movement or impulsion  and subsequent division of the élan vital : an artillery shell that bursts into fragments  (C.E., p.98); consciousness as a jet of steam under high pressure that condenses into  little drops that fall (C.E., p.247) and rockets in a firework display whose extinguished  fragments fall back as matter (C.E., p.261).  In Creative Evolution , the élan vital  is both  the explosion and the explosive (C.E., p.115); however, he refers to it as:    … a limited force, which is always seeking to transcend itself and always  remains inadequate to the work it would fain produce. (C.E., p.126)    For Bergson the ascending movement or explosion includes the undifferentiated  tendencies of consciousness and matter, and while metaphors of steam and fireworks  describe the initial and subsequent movement as ascending and descending, he suggests  that after the initial explosion of energy, the movement of the élan vital,  which is  unlimited in its original impetus, is interrupted; it loses its power and becomes limited,  in the way that the light from a firework fades as it burns up its fuel or when raising an  arm, it falls back by itself as soon as the will to keep it up is diminished (C.E., p.247).   In Creative Evolution the élan vital , which Bergson refers to as “God”, is “unceasing  life, action, freedom” (C.E., p.248), and we must understand that according to his  definition of freedom it means that the élan vital  is originally conscious or awake and  possesses a ‘will’ to create (C.E., p.270; M.E., p.155).  On its interruption, which  Bergson associates with a ‘deficiency of will’ or a relaxation of attention, it effectively  becomes unconscious matter; however, he also suggests that when left to itself, a raised  arm will fall back, but in “striving to raise it up again”, it retains “something of the will  that animates it” (C.E., p.247); hence the élan vital  is not completely exhausted.  </p><div id="pagenum"><p>162</p></div><p id="page">154   Drawing on Deleuze (Deleuze, 1991, p.104), Ansell Pearson comments that the élan  vital is:  a limited force or power in need of actualisation: it is given as a simple virtual  (of tendencies) but never given as a virtual whole that is always being  actualised.  As an original impulsion it must be finite though capable of  potentially infinite transformation. … the finite and infinite are not being  conceived numerically …but rather in terms of limited and unlimited. (Ansell- Pearson, 2002, p.96)    Like Plotinus, Bergson utilises the Pythagorean concepts of the unlimited and limiting,  explained in Chapter 2 as ‘pre-existing’ powers to act; the active power to limit and the  passive power to be limited.   This describes perfectly what happens to sound; after the  initial sound explosion it reaches a peak then loses energy, a process which in the  science of acoustics is called ‘attack and decay’ (Gunther, 2012, p.52).  According to  Bergson’s theory the ‘attack’ or ascending movement would include the  undifferentiated tendencies of consciousness and matter: consciousness has the passive  power to be limited, and which is actually limited at the peak by matter because it  congeals or becomes static, a limitation Bergson associates with a lack of  consciousness or a deficiency of will that may be considered as ‘decay’.  Bergson states  that: “Extension  … appears only as a tension which is interrupted” (C.E., p.245):  He  also refers to the interruption as ‘inversion’, which refers to matter in its dynamic form  as an independent tendency that descends, a movement in the opposite direction to  consciousness.    What, then, is the principle that has only to let go its tension—may we say to  detend—in order to extend, the interruption of the cause here being equivalent  to a reversal of the effect? For want of a better word we have called it  consciousness. But we do not mean the narrowed consciousness that functions  in each of us. (C.E., p.237)   </p><div id="pagenum"><p>163</p></div><p id="page">155   there are then two processes opposite in their direction, and we pass from the  first to the second by way of inversion, or perhaps even by simple interruption,  if it is true that inversion and interruption are two terms which in this case must  be held to be synonymous. (C.E., p.201)    The ascending and descending movement described in Creative Evolution becomes a  swinging of a pendulum in The Two Sources of Morality and Religion (T.S.M.R.,  p.292).  In physics the movement of a pendulum is known as ‘simple harmonic  motion’, the most elementary oscillatory system that is called ‘harmonic’ because it is  linked to sound vibrations; therefore, it is appropriate for illustrating Bergson’s  movement of consciousness, as was done for Plotinus in Chapter 3.  Figure 17  illustrates that when considered as standing waves that generate harmonics between  two nodes, God is the first node and the élan vital is the forward movement of energy  that generates the second node, which for Bergson would be matter as interruption.   The inversion illustrates the tendency of matter to form closed systems in its return to  the original position, as in the return swing of a pendulum.  These two initial  movements of the élan vital occur temporally, hence a before and after, forming the  basis of a supra-consciousness or impersonal memory that is the origin of life (C.E.,  p.261).  As such it represents the first vibration or duration of the élan vital that can be  considered the ‘fundamental’ or first harmonic.                         </p><div id="pagenum"><p>164</p></div><p id="page">156   The Creation of Memory (Figure 17)      Bergson’s mechanism of impulsion and inversion effectively replicates Plotinus’  movements of procession and reversion that creates Intellect, the ‘Form of the First  Forms’, as illustrated in Figure 7.100    At this early stage in the generative process it is important to note an apparent  contradiction in Bergson’s account of the extent of the élan vital  consciousness.  If the  élan vital  possesses a ‘will’ to create and is “unceasing life, action, freedom” (C.E.,  p.248), features that Bergson associates with consciousness, how it is possible for the  tendencies it contains undifferentiated to be merely virtual?  This is an issue that  Bergson does not address; however, he appears to be adopting Plotinus’ notion of the  inchoate Intellect that in its initial procession from and reversion to the One, is “sight  not yet seeing”, which means that is not self-conscious or conscious of its act of  thinking.  The following section will explore how, in the generation of life, these  movements become self-conscious and are related to the movement of the mind that is  implicit in Bergson’s concept of philosophical intuition.                                                                          100  Chapter 3.2, p.73.  </p><div id="pagenum"><p>165</p></div><p id="page">157   5.3   The Ontological and Epistemological Transformation of the  Élan Vital        In Creative Evolution , the model Bergson proposes for his cosmology comes from  biological knowledge and theories of his day.  He notes that the process of biological  evolution demonstrates a chronological succession among species in which complex  forms of life evolve from more simple ones, and that in the domain of life we find  complex forms developing when a single cell divides into two, and these in turn  continue to divide into cells that associate to form different organs in the body (C.E.,  p.260).  Basically, all life begins as one and remains united as it becomes many in a  process of self-generation and transformation through division and association.  It will  however be argued that like Plotinus, harmonic motion is the mechanism Bergson  adopts to account for the ontological and epistemological transformation of the élan  vital.  Bergson proposes that the élan vital  functions as it does in our own psychical life,  that is, according to the movement of consciousness implicit in his concept of  philosophical intuition.  While he is not explicit in describing his cosmology as the  generation of harmonics, it is noteworthy that when discussing the nature of parallelism  of the mind and body in Mind-Energy,  he implies that his philosophical method  generates ideas in the form of harmonics:     These four ideas themselves imply a great number of others, which it would be  interesting to analyse in their turn, because they would be found to be, in a kind  of way, so many harmonics, the fundamental tone of which is the thesis of  parallelism. (‘Brain and Thought’, in M.E., p.254)101                                                                  101  Similarly, when discussing the play of ideas in intellectual effort he suggests that ‘these        mental oscillations have their sensory harmonics’ (‘Intellectual Effort’ in M.E., p.222).  </p><div id="pagenum"><p>166</p></div><p id="page">158   It is only a sentence; however, it provides a ground from which we can hypothesise that  the élan vital also generates harmonics, since Bergson claimed the cosmological  process replicates his method of philosophical intuition that “bears above all on internal  duration” (‘Introduction II’, in C.M., p.32):    The matter and life which fill the world are equally within us; the forces which  work in all things we feel within ourselves; whatever may be the inner essence  of what is and what is done, we are of that essence. (‘Philosophical Intuition’, in  C.M., p.124)    Furthermore, in a speech to the Société Française de la Philosophie, given in 1908 he  stated:    One of the objects of Creative Evolution is to show that All is ... of the same  nature as the I, and that one grasps it by a more and more complete immersion  in oneself. ( Mélanges , p.774)    Similarly, in Creative Evolution : “intuition is mind itself, and, in a certain sense, life  itself” (C.E., p. 268), which suggests that because we obtain knowledge of  psychological duration using this method, it can also reveal that the generative activity  of the élan vital  is an act of self-organisation.   It was argued that Bergson regards the generation of multiplicity as harmonic  motion, as in the forwards and backwards motion of a pendulum, and in his account of  philosophical intuition he describes it as a reversal of thought that is essentially an act  of self-consciousness in which intellect turns in on itself as an act of vision that is not  directly aimed at action.  It is a “direct vision of the mind by the mind” (C.M., p.42),102                                                                102  See also C.E., p.196; ‘The Perception of Change’, in C.M., p.138, where Bergson        Considers the act of intuition to be like that of the artist who is not focused on action but        Simply “perceives in order to perceive”; In ‘Soul and Body’ in M.E., p.43, Bergson refers         to consciousness as “a faculty of observation”.      </p><div id="pagenum"><p>167</p></div><p id="page">159   thus replicating Plotinus’ act of contemplation that begins the generative process with  an act of vision subsequent to the procession and reversion of the inchoate Intellect as  “sight not yet seeing”.  Bergson refers to the movement to the interior as “reflection”  (‘Introduction II’, in C.M., p.88), as illustrated in Figure 18.    The Reflection of the Elan Vital  (Figure 18)          Bergson refers to the movement of intuition as “the attention the mind gives to itself,  over and above, while fixed upon matter, its object” (‘Introduction II’, in C.M., p.79)  and it is “self-conscious, capable of reflecting upon its object and of enlarging it  indefinitely” (C.E., p.176), and while this has epistemological implications which will  soon be explained, for now let us focus on the movement itself.  If we return to  Bergson’s pendulum, the reflection is interrupted by matter and by following the  direction of the arrows in Figure 19 below, it can be seen that the second inversion  crosses the initial reflection, generating a node that enables the two élans to generate  alternately, as he claims in his 1908 letter to Tonquédec.103                                                                          103  See: p.139.  </p><div id="pagenum"><p>168</p></div><p id="page">160   The Alternate Generation of Consciousness and Matter (Figure 19)        Alternate generation is also a theme Bergson continues in The Two Sources of Morality  and Religion  where he proposes: “the tendencies, born of the process of splitting, …  can be developed only in succession” because there is a continual progress in the  movement from one to the other (T.S.M.R., p.295).  Therefore, it is the inversion of  matter that is responsible for the actualisation of itself and of consciousness as  individual durations or tendencies:    Contact with matter is what determines this dissociation. Matter divides actually  what was but potentially manifold; and, in this sense, individuation is in part the  work of matter, in part the result of life's own inclination. (C.E., p.258)    It is only in seeing consciousness run through matter, lose itself there and find  itself again, divide and reconstitute itself, that we shall form an idea of the  mutual opposition of the two terms, as also of their common origin. (C.E.,  p.178-179)    In reflection the material object is seen as durational.  The object, and therefore  knowledge of the object, becomes enlarged with an intense focus the attention.  The  colours used in Figure 19 also help to demonstrate how the élan vital as supra- consciousness becomes aware of difference or the fan-wise growth within itself as a  </p><div id="pagenum"><p>169</p></div><p id="page">161   temporal process.  Following the colour of the direction of the tendencies, or simply  considering the nodes themselves explains Bergson’s example provided in The Two  Sources of Morality and Religion :      Let us imagine that orange is the only colour that has as yet made its appearance  in the world. Would it be already a composite of yellow and red? Obviously not.  But it will have been composed of yellow and red when these two colours are  born in their turn; from that hour the original orange colour can be looked at  from the twofold point of view of red and yellow; and if we supposed, by a trick  of fancy, that yellow and red appeared through an intensification of orange, we  should have a very simple example of what we call fan-wise growth. (T.S.M.R.,  p.294)    Reminiscent of Plotinus, the crossing or coincidence of consciousness and matter is a  phenomenon that Bergson refers to as “fan-wise growth”, which demonstrates a  common source for all things.  In his psychology of intuition, he emphasises the  importance of placing ourselves at the mid-point where consciousness and matter  coincide.  At this point the élan vital  will experience itself as a continuous, qualitative  heterogeneous multiplicity because it is aware of all three colours simultaneously either  differentiated or integrated within its consciousness, which explains why he refers to his  philosophical method of intuition as the operation of “differentiations and qualitative  integrations” (‘Introduction to Metaphysics’, in C.M., p.191).  He provides an example  of how it functions within his act of vision in Duration and Simultaneity :    I call two flows “contemporaneous” when they are equally one or two for my  consciousness, the latter perceiving them together as a single flowing if it sees  fit to engage in an undivided act of attention, and, on the other hand, separating  them throughout if it prefers to divide its attention between them, even doing  both at one and the same time if it decides to divide its attention and yet not cut  it in two.  (D.S., p.35)   </p><div id="pagenum"><p>170</p></div><p id="page">162   For Bergson, reflection is therefore not pure thinking or idea; it is an immediate  experience that determines differences in kind.  He states its consciousness would:    …follow purely and simply the thread of experience …  Such a mind would  see facts succeed facts, states succeed states, things succeed things. What it  would notice at each moment would be things existing, states appearing, events  happening.  It would live in the actual, and even if it were capable of judging, it  would never affirm anything except the existence of the present.      Endow this mind with memory, and especially with the desire to dwell on  the past; give it a faculty of dissociating and of distinguishing; it will no  longer only note the present state of the passing reality; it will represent the  passing as a change, and therefore a contrast between what has been and what  is.  (C.E., p.294)    Gouhier proposes that we should not consider Bergson to be influenced here by Maine  de Biran who referred to his method of introspection as reflection; Biran’s reflection  and Bergson’s intuition are very different psychological experiences.  While Biran’s  reflection depends on the experience of effort that limits the self to knowledge of its  phenomenal states, the inner experience needs an act of faith to transcend it; however,  Bergson’s intuition is the perception of duration as immediate experience, prolonging  psychological experience into the metaphysical (Gouhier, 1948).  Mullarkey explains  Bergson’s reflection on ‘the other’ and the contact or coincidence arising from that  reflection as a “passing through rather than aiming” that provides “partial knowledge”  of the whole, not relative.  Furthermore, “the experience of the other is part of what it is  to understand and reclaim one’s own alterity” (Mullarkey, 2000, p.95 and p.116).  The  élan vital  experiences itself as durational; it is conscious of its present experience  which includes the presence of its past in its entirety, a ‘perpetual present’, a past- present or present-past that can be prolonged indefinitely.  Bergson states that “the  piling up of the past upon the past goes on without relaxation.  In reality, the past is </p><div id="pagenum"><p>171</p></div><p id="page">163   preserved by itself, automatically” (C.E., p.5); hence, as consciousness reflects on  matter it retains its conscious states in an impersonal memory.      Like Plotinus, who generates Being before knowing, Bergson generates matter  before the reflection on it; for both philosophers there is an asymmetrical relationship  between being and knowing, and hence thinking and knowing.    Let us now consider how matter and consciousness develop their own offspring.   It has been demonstrated how Bergson’s ‘law of dichotomy’ splits the élan vital , as one  tendency or impulsion into two; and Bergson suggests that these tendencies, now  different in nature, develop in divergent directions, ‘fan-wise’ in the shape of a sheaf,  with each tendency receiving a certain portion of the impetus (C.E., p.116; T.S.M.R.,  p.293-294).  If we return to Bergson’s pendulum, he states:    All prolonged action, it would seem, brings about a reaction in the opposite  direction. Then it starts anew, and the pendulum swings on indefinitely. …the  pendulum is endowed with memory, and is not the same when it swings back  as on the outward swing, since it is then richer by all the intermediate  experience. (T.S.M.R., p.292)     Following the second inversion, the élan vital  swings back again and the process  continues “indefinitely”; hence if we consider Bergson’s metaphors in Creative  Evolution , the firework continually sends up rockets which illuminate the falling  fragments (matter/inversion), and the will to raise the arm subsists, despite its fall.  The  process of division is therefore essentially open or indefinite and he describes it in  terms of a fractalisation of a shell:    The evolution movement … proceeds rather like a shell, which suddenly bursts  into fragments, which fragments, being themselves shells, burst in their turn into  fragments destined to burst again, and so on for a time incommensurably long.  (C.E., p.98) </p><div id="pagenum"><p>172</p></div><p id="page">164   It is an accurate metaphor for describing how, in the generation of harmonics each  harmonic becomes a fundamental generating its own harmonics as an infinite series.  It  is reasonable to deduce that this is what Bergson intended, especially as in Matter and  Memory he joins the physicists of his day to consider matter as having an internal  structure that consists in a ‘pervading concrete extensity, modifications, perturbations,  changes of tension or energy and nothing else’ (M.M., p.266).  As such Bergson  regards it as extensive rather than extended; we must not think of the vibrations of  matter as vibrations in a medium, such as space; matter is these vibrations.  The French  mathematician and music theorist Marin Mersenne had already described the equations  for the frequency of oscillation of a stretched string or monochord in his work Traité de  l'harmonie universelle (1637) and in 1807 Fourier discovered that any temporal wave  that has a consistent repeating pattern or continuous function can be broken down into  an infinite sum of simpler sine and cosine waves with differing amplitudes (Fourier,  1808).  Garber explains how his work was “crucial …as a means of expressing all  manner of wave phenomena and arbitrary functions that occur in physics and  engineering” (Garber, 1999, p.112).  Helmholtz provided an illustration of the  generation of harmonics similar to Figure 3 (p.47) in his work On the Sensations of  Tone (Von Helmholtz, 1863, p.46).  It was therefore acknowledged mathematically that  according to the law of harmonics the fundamental initially divides into two  frequencies, and it makes sense of Bergson’s “law of dichotomy”, the law that  presumably applies to consciousness and matter when each is a fundamental.  Matter  generates harmonics within itself that represent qualitative differences external to the  perceiving subject, and consciousness generates harmonics that represent differences of  function and degree of consciousness in living beings.  Figure 20 illustrates that  according to this law consciousness divides into intellect and instinct, which are </p><div id="pagenum"><p>173</p></div><p id="page">165   complementary tendencies or faculties whose ontological and epistemological  functions differ.    Consciousness, Matter and the Law of Dichotomy (Figure 20)        Intellect thinks but does not know the durational nature of matter; hence it is  characterised by its natural inability to comprehend life (C.E., p.165).  It divides the  matter it perceives into extended objects in homogenous space, purely as an outward  projection of the practical need to fix centres of action so it can interact and satisfy  interests or needs, and it complements matter’s tendency to become spatialized because  “intellect bears within itself, in the form of natural logic, a “latent geometrism”” (C.E.,  p.195), hence Bergson states:    And as matter is determined by intelligence, as there is between them an evident  agreement, we cannot make the genesis of the one without making the genesis  of the other.  An identical process must have cut out matter and the intellect, at  the same time, from a stuff that contained both. (C.E., p.199)    The common form of matter and intellect implies for Bergson that “knowledge ceases to  be a product of the intellect and becomes, in a certain sense, part and parcel of reality”  (C.E., p.153).  In the above quotation the “stuff that contained both” is the élan vital  as  consciousness in general before it split into two separate tendencies.  While intellect has  </p><div id="pagenum"><p>174</p></div><p id="page">166   knowledge of its object in terms of its spatiality or extension , instinct, on the other hand,  has categorical or implicit knowledge of its material object in terms of its intension or  internal vibration as a property (C.E., p.149-150).  Instinct therefore is a vital process; it  distinguishes properties through sympathy with the whole; it feels but does not think  because it acts its knowledge; therefore we cannot conflate the notion of thinking with  knowledge.    Bergson proposes “The two tendencies, at first implied in each other, had to  separate in order to grow” (C.E., p.150); each fringe the other:    There is no intelligence in which some traces of instinct are not to be  discovered, more especially no instinct that is not surrounded with a fringe of  intelligence. (C.E., p.136)    So, while they are tendencies that differ in kind, and diverge as they develop, they are  complementary and not absolutely separate, and in a statement, that is reminiscent of  Plotinus, Bergson suggests that matter breaks up consciousness into individual  tendencies or faculties:    The matter that it bears along with it, and in the interstices of which it inserts  itself, alone can divide it into distinct individualities. … This subdivision was  vaguely indicated in it, but could not have been made clear without matter.   Thus souls are continually being created, which, nevertheless, in a certain sense  pre-existed. (C.E., p.269-70)    While spatialised matter is a product of intellect, the dynamic aspect of matter, its  inversion, breaks up or interrupts the impulse of consciousness, forming a node at their  intersection.  Figure 20 shows how the inversion of matter is necessary for the  generation of individual souls, and it is a process that continues indefinitely as the </p><div id="pagenum"><p>175</p></div><p id="page">167   pendulum unceasingly continues its forward motion as reflection, and its return as  inversion.    In reality, life is a movement, materiality is the inverse movement, and each of  these two movements is simple, the matter which forms a world being an  undivided flux, and undivided also the life that runs through it, cutting out in it  living beings all along its track. Of these two currents the second runs counter to  the first, but the first obtains, all the same, something from the second. There  results between them a modus vivendi , which is organization. (C.E., p.250-251)    For Bergson the act of thinking intuitively is an effort for the human intellect; however,  while the reversal of its natural direction of thought is self-conscious, Bergson does not  specifically address the issue of whether the act of thinking is included in what the élan  vital thinks when it is thinking creation in his cosmology.  He states that in human  intuition, the act is one of tension, and therefore, attentive, but it cannot be sustained for  long; “It is a lamp almost extinguished, which only glimmers now and then, for a few  moments at most” (C.E., p.267).  From intuition we return to intellect that transforms  the data into concepts.  Similarly, in his cosmology, the élan vital renews its efforts to  continue the creative process.  In Creative Evolution  Bergson suggests that while self- consciousness commences with intuition, which is the movement on which his whole  cosmology is based, it loses something of itself in the process:    It is as if a vague and formless being, whom we may call, as we will, man or  superman, had sought to realize himself, and had succeeded only by  abandoning a part of himself on the way. (C.E., p.226)    But a glance at the evolution of living beings shows us that intuition could  not go very far. On the side of intuition, consciousness found itself so  restricted by its envelope that intuition had to shrink into instinct, that is, to  embrace only the very small portion of life that interested it; and this it  embraces only in the dark, touching it while hardly seeing it. On this side, </p><div id="pagenum"><p>176</p></div><p id="page">168   the horizon was soon shut out. On the contrary, consciousness, in shaping  itself into intelligence, that is to say in concentrating itself at first on matter,  seems to externalize itself in relation to itself; but, just because it adapts  itself thereby to objects from without, it succeeds in moving among them  and in evading the barriers they oppose to it, thus opening to itself an  unlimited field. Once freed, moreover, it can turn inwards on itself, and  awaken the potentialities of intuition which still slumber within it. (C.E.,  p.182)    Bergson proceeds to suggest that the élan vital  only regains its self-consciousness in  man who “comes to occupy a privileged place” because he possesses the ability to  continue the vital movement indefinitely (C.E., pp.181-182); however, this implies a  contradiction.  If the movement of intuition generates the multitude of tendencies in life  prior to man, it suggests that the élan vital is ultimately conscious of itself and its  creations at the highest level, in fact, he appears to consider the possibility in Matter  and Memory  when he speculates on the possibility that a supra-conscious memory could  “watch the development of humanity while contracting it, …into the great phases of its  evolution. (M.M., p.275).  Since ‘watching’ is an act of vision or reflection, self- consciousness of thinking creativity concurs with the model presented here, despite the  apparent erosion of consciousness in the generative process.  Furthermore, Bergson  states that the élan vital  retains “something of the will that animates it” on its  interruption and inversion (C.E., p.247), a stage that is vital for continuity in the  process.  It is therefore proposed that within Bergson’s notion of a supra-consciousness  the act of thinking is included in what the élan vital  thinks when it is thinking creation.                         </p><div id="pagenum"><p>177</p></div><p id="page">169   Conclusion        It was explained that Bergson was ambiguous about the nature of God and the élan  vital in Creative Evolution,  but later clarified his position by proposing that God  remains distinct from the élan vital but is active within it.  Bergson strongly rejected  the notion of pantheism and it was therefore proposed that he followed the  Pythagoreans and Plotinus who could be more accurately placed in the category of  panentheism .  Bergson follows Plotinus in rejecting the notion of parts being generated as an  assemblage of pre-existing parts, and the generation of multiplicity for both  philosophers is one of self-generation in which the self transforms itself.  Bergson  states: “the essence of life is the movement by which life is transmitted” (C.E., p.128),  and it is a description that applies equally well to Plotinus.  Similarly, Bergson captures  the substantial nature of the movement in ‘The Perception of Change’:    There are changes, but there are underneath the change no things which  change: change has no need of support.  There are movements, but there is no  inert or variable object which moves: movement does not imply a mobile.  (‘The Perception of Change’ in C.M., p.147)    The movement of consciousness or mind is the same for both philosophers and is  analogous to the model of the generation of harmonics: (1) there is an initial outward  movement of energy from a node (Plotinus/The One; Bergson/ God) in the form of  love, which for both philosophers is an immensity of potentiality as an undifferentiated  unity of tendencies; (2) the forward movement of energy is interrupted, generating a  second node (Plotinus - rest/ Being; Bergson - interruption/matter), and then the  movement reverts (Plotinus) or inverts (Bergson).  Together, the first two movements </p><div id="pagenum"><p>178</p></div><p id="page">170   generate the fundamental (Plotinus - Intellect: Bergson - supra-conscious memory. (3)  Consciousness reflects back onto the second node, and on its reversion/inversion a third  node is generated where the movements cross, dividing the movement into two new  fundamentals (Plotinus - Soul and World Soul ; Bergson - intellect and matter).  The  pendulum movement continues, producing new nodes and their associated vibrations  within each fundamental.  Plotinus’s Intellect becomes Bergson’s supra-conscious memory, both possessing  a vibrational nature that is full of life, and the contents of which do not change once  generated, and Plotinus’s Soul becomes Bergson’s intellect whose function is to  spatialize matter.  Despite the similarities, Bergson’s mechanism differs from that of  Plotinus; whereas Plotinus hypostasises Intellect as eternity and Soul as its temporal  expression, Bergson synthesises Plotinus’ Hypostases  so that his ontological and  epistemological structure is a process that is wholly temporal.   It is therefore concluded that the science of harmonics potentially solves the  ‘mystery’ of Bergson’s cosmology; however, several issues require an explanation and  will be addressed in the following chapter.  The first is how consciousness and matter  are integrated to include spontaneity and freedom within his account of partial finalism;  the second is how Bergson’s account of number and mathematics fits into his  cosmology; and finally, since his “fan-wise” generation of multiplicity suggests that,  like Plotinus, there is a connection with the Pythagorean tetractys, it needs to be  determined whether Bergson is sympathetic to the Pythagorean philosophy of  transformation.        </p><div id="pagenum"><p>179</p></div><p id="page">171   Chapter 6    Bergson - Harmonics of Evolution    *      Introduction        This Chapter examines Bergson’s arguments for partial finalism, his theory of number,  the influence of mathematics, and his sympathy with Pythagorean philosophy.  It will  be contended that in Creative Evolution Bergson adopted the 3-stage generative  structure of Pythagorean cosmology, and applied the key themes of disassociation,  association, attunement, sympathy, conflict and war to the evolutionary process.  His  arguments for partial finalism reveal that the model of harmonics is consistent with the  musical theme  he proposed, and accounts for spontaneity, novelty and similarities in  structure in the evolutionary process due to the proportional existence of tendencies  within matter and organic life .  It will be proposed that Bergson’s notions of  quantitative and qualitative multiplicity replicate Plotinus’ concepts of monadic number  and substantial number as logos enabling him to reconcile matter and consciousness.   The subject of number then leads to an examination of Bergson’s mathematical  influences.  It will be argued that while it is commonly held that Riemann influenced  Bergson’s account of discrete and continuous multiplicities, and that modern calculus  influenced his method of intuition, a Pythagorean influence, not previously considered,  makes more sense of his arguments.  The claim of a Pythagorean influence on Bergson  will then be supported by an examination of his ‘Lectures on the Pythagoreans’,  revealing his sympathy with Pythagorean number theory and their philosophy of </p><div id="pagenum"><p>180</p></div><p id="page">172   transformation.  Finally, the view that Bergson used melody as a metaphor for duration  will be contested.         6.1    Bergson’s Partial Finalism        Bergson argues against radical mechanism and finalism because both start from the  assumption that all is given.  Mechanism presupposes the elements out of which reality  is built making it mathematically predictable, and finalism presupposes a plan as an end  to be achieved.  For Bergson, they both ignore the temporality of the evolutionary  process and cannot account for spontaneity and novelty.  He does however make a  concession to finalism in accepting it to a certain extent (C.E., p.40) because the end to  be achieved is the creation of novelty itself; an evolution that is established in its  progress.  It will be contended that Bergson’s ‘creative evolution’ is grounded in the 3- stage generative structure of Pythagorean cosmology.  Bergson’s partial finalism rests on the notion of consciousness and matter as  separate tendencies in the élan vital  that has a ‘supra-conscious’ nature (C.E., p.261)  because it possesses all degrees of consciousness, including intellect, instinct, intuition,  as well as the latent consciousness of unorganised matter and the sleeping  consciousness of immobile vegetable matter.  For Bergson consciousness is memory  and anticipation of the future (M.E., p.8):    … if …consciousness retains the past and anticipates the future, it is probably  because it is called on to make a choice.  In order to choose, we must know  what we can do and remember the consequences, advantageous or injurious, of  what we have already done; we must foresee and we must remember. (M.E.,  p14)   </p><div id="pagenum"><p>181</p></div><p id="page">173   The consciousness of unorganised matter is latent because while it possesses a  memory that is limited to repeating the past (M.M., p.297), it does not anticipate the  future.  Organised matter, however, evolves and has the potential to become conscious,  because “movement and consciousness sleep in it as recollections which may waken”  (C.E., p.119).  Bergson notes Darwin’s work on the movements of climbing plants and  refers to their consciousness in terms of “the accidental awakening of an activity  normally asleep” (C.E., pp.108-109).  Organised, or organic matter, such as that found  in single celled organisms, plants, animals and human life, possess degrees of  consciousness that vary with the freedom or power of choice implicit in the ability to  move, and the power of choice is linked to the organism’s ability to anticipate the  future together with its degree of memory.    … if …consciousness retains the past and anticipates the future, it is probably  because it is called on to make a choice.  In order to choose, we must know  what we can do and remember the consequences, advantageous or injurious, of  what we have already done; we must foresee and we must remember. (M.E.,  p.14)    He argues that actions or movements originate with a “decision that implies choice”,  and that these movements subsequently become automatic and unconscious.  The  intensity of consciousness is therefore linked to the degree of choice or “to the amount  of creation” required by the movement.  (M.E., p.15)    But this consciousness, which is a need of creation , is made manifest to itself  only where creation is possible. It lies dormant when life is condemned to  automatism; it wakens as soon as the possibility of a choice is restored. (C.E.,  p.261)    The “need of creation” is associated with the need of Bergson’s God to reproduce and  evolve in a form that requires a freely chosen process of change, creation and growth </p><div id="pagenum"><p>182</p></div><p id="page">174   (T.S.M.R., p. 255) as explained in Chapter 5.104  One may therefore question the nature  of his finalism since the ‘need’ is a goal that is persistently achieved; however, from  Bergson‘s perspective his finalism is partial because the goal is creation itself which is  indeterminate and unlikely to be achieved because the freedom of man is restricted by  matter.  The subject of freedom is addressed in more detail in Chapter 9.105         While supra-consciousness is essentially mind-like because it lacks  consciousness in some of its manifestations, as it wakens, sensibility and freedom  increase (C.E., p.119), thus partially accounting for spontaneity and the generation of  unforeseen novelty.   The degree of consciousness is determined by an organism’s  vibration and is linked to its development in the evolutionary process:    In reality there is no one rhythm of duration; it is possible to imagine many  different rhythms which, slower or faster, measure the degree of tension or  relaxation of different kinds of consciousness and thereby fix their respective  places in the scale of being.  (M.M., p.275)    Bergson claims: “like radical finalism, although in a vaguer form, our philosophy  represents the organised world as a harmonious whole” (C.E., p.50); however, it is not  perfect because each species and individual only receives a portion of the impetus and  uses it for its own interests or needs.  Consciousness has the need to create in both time  and space and “needs” a body which it carves out of matter (M.M., p.262); hence ‘need’  is the reason why the two dissociated tendencies, consciousness and matter, associate to  form organic life.  The carving out of a body is achieved by perception, a subject that  will be explored in Chapter 9; however, it is important to understand here that the  vibrational nature of the separate tendencies makes it possible.  In perception                                                                104  Chapter 5.1, p.142.  105  Chapter 9.2, p.272. </p><div id="pagenum"><p>183</p></div><p id="page">175   consciousness condenses the vibrations of matter within its own vibration and selects a  body based on attunement or correspondence.  In Creative Evolution  Bergson proposes:  “intellect is in tune with matter” (C.E., p.195), and therefore there is a “correspondence”  between them (C.E., p.140) so they can associate or unite even though they are  opposed, thus replicating Plotinus’ ‘law of correspondence’ between soul and its body  whose parts are unequal.  Chapter 4  noted the theory of attunement or correspondence is  linked to the Pythagorean belief in the analogy between microcosm and macrocosm in  which universal kinship or sympathy occurs between the universe and its parts.106   Bergson also explicitly refers to the theme of sympathy between consciousness and  matter in his concepts of intuition (C.M., p.77; p.161-163) and instinct (C.E., p.176).   He suggests that instinct is intuition that has shrunk its range of interest to perpetuating  the life and evolution of individual species, (C.E., p.182); it does not speculate, but like  intuition, has categorical or implicit knowledge of its object in terms of its intension or  internal vibration:    Intuition seeks to recapture, to get back the movement and rhythm … to live  again creative evolution by being one with it in sympathy. (‘Introduction II’, in  C.M., p.77)     Furthermore, Bergson replicates Plotinus and the Pythagoreans in proposing the  interaction of matter and consciousness can be harmonious or discordant:    A tendency achieves all that it aims at only if it is not thwarted by another  tendency, i.e. there is always opposition …the interaction of tendencies is  always implied (C.E., p.13 )                                                                  106  Ennead III.3.5,4; Chapter 4.2, pp.114-116.  </p><div id="pagenum"><p>184</p></div><p id="page">176   We cannot regard life as the creation of a “musical concert” by something like a human  genius, “wherein the seeming discords are really meant to bring out a fundamental  harmony”; a large part of the evolutionary process arises from “retrogressions, arrests,  accidents of every kind” (C.E., p.127-8).  Bergson refers to the discordance as an  “irremediable difference of rhythm” (C.E., p.128) and a conflict of “opposing forces”  (T.S.M.R., p.57).  He develops the theme in The Two Sources of Morality and Religion   when discussing the nature of war in human societies, suggesting that ‘war is natural’  (T.S.M.R., p.284) and a necessary part of the evolutionary process; nature did not  ordain it just for the sake of it.    War is the ‘origin of empires’, ‘born of conquest’ has the potential to bring  societies together, to integrate the weaker ones onto the stronger, or even  destroy whole societies (T.S.M.R., p.276).     As noted in Chapter 4, the conflict between harmonics is referred to in modern physics  as constructive or destructive interference, where new nodes are generated from the  interaction of standing waves that change the vibration of one or both for better or  worse.107  It is a principle Bergson explicitly employs in Laughter and which he refers  to as “reciprocal interference”.  In a footnote he states:     The word "interference" has here the meaning given to it in Optics, where it  indicates the partial superposition and neutralisation, by each other, of two  series of light-waves. ( Laughter, p.47)    Interference must not be confused with the ‘interruption’ of the élan vital  that generates  nodes as an orderly sequence of harmonics.108 The concept of constructive and                                                                107  Chapter 4.2, pp.110-111.  108  Chapter 5.2, pp.153-155.   </p><div id="pagenum"><p>185</p></div><p id="page">177   destructive interference explains why there are retrogressions, arrests, accidents and  sudden variations in the evolution of life; why some species become extinct while  others take on novel forms.  When harmonics are produced, the greatest harmony is  found near the start when the vibrations are less frequent; discords naturally occur at  more frequent vibrations when the fundamental or its subsequent harmonics form  unions; a fact concurring with Bergson’s assertion in Creative Evolution :    Harmony, therefore, does not exist in fact; it exists rather in principle. …  Especially (and this is the point on which finalism has been most seriously  mistaken) harmony is rather behind us than before. It is due to an identity of  impulsion and not to a common aspiration. (C.E., p.51)    When Bergson states that harmony is behind rather than before us it is consistent with  his argument for fan-wise growth which infers a common source, that if orange is the  only colour to have made an appearance in the world, it will have been composed of red  and yellow when they are born in their turn.109  It is also consistent with Plotinus who  also suggests that nature becomes disharmonious due to interference, and not only does  nature make mistakes, but it starts from a much lower level in terms of its logos;  however, Plotinus is more of a finalist than Bergson.  Whereas Bergson’s universe  appears to become increasingly disharmonious, Plotinus proposes that the World Soul   maintains the universe as a harmonious whole according the logoi or providence it  receives from Intellect and corrects mistakes or disharmony arising in nature.   Taking the whole process of generation into account Bergson appears to adopt  the 3-stage generative structure of Pythagorean cosmology, as described by Cornford:                                                                  109  See: Chapter 5.3, p.161.  </p><div id="pagenum"><p>186</p></div><p id="page">178   (1)  There is an undifferentiated unity. (2)  From this unity two opposite  powers are separated out to form the world order. (3)  The two opposites unite  again to generate life. (Cornford, 1923, p.3)    At stage 3, unity may arise through the conflict of opposites:      In the third stage of the cosmological formula the combination of the sundered  opposites to generate life is represented in mythical terms either as a marriage  or as a warfare. …The marriage symbol is appropriate in the order of space.  …The alternative symbol of warfare [is] conceived rather as the seasonal  powers in the order of time, in which each prevails successively and yields to  its antagonist.  The principle of justice is preserved by this balanced alternation  of advance and retreat. (Cornford, 1923, p.4)     Furthermore, Bergson’s conception of consciousness as “powers” accords with  Pythagorean philosophy as well as Plotinus’ account of Soul, as was explained in  Chapters 2 and 4 respectively.  Bergson rejects the notion of a Lockean atomistic  powers ontology that considers the intrinsic nature of powers as having external  relations (Locke, 1689, II.23.37, p.286), in favour of tendencies, creative powers that  continually differentiate qualitatively internally.  Bergson’s theory of the élan vital   operating as an internal force in the evolutionary process was offered as an alternative  to the neo-Lamarckian and neo-Darwinian theories of evolution.  While he accepted the  neo-Lamarckian theory of an inner psychological principle, he rejected the notion that a  living being’s individual effort to adapt to the circumstances of its existence accounts  for variability (C.E. p.76-84).  The neo-Darwinists, including the English naturalist,  Alfred Russel Wallace and the German evolutionary biologist, August Weismann,  accepted Darwin’s theory of natural selection but rejected his theory of pangenesis,  which is similar to Lamarck’s notion of the inheritance of acquired characteristics.   Bergson rejected the neo-Darwinian theory of natural selection or adaptation because it  opposes the notion of an internal divine or conscious force working in the evolutionary </p><div id="pagenum"><p>187</p></div><p id="page">179   process in favour of random external factors.  Bergson argues since the structural  changes would be so small, their utility cannot be proven, thus making natural selection  untenable.  Furthermore, adaptation results in a conceptual confusion because it implies  indetermination in the creation of new forms and an active response to external  circumstances, implying a causality that is predetermined (C.E., p.86).  For Bergson,  the élan vital is indivisibly dynamic and cannot be differentiated into cause and effect.   He suggests that accidental changes arising from external factors cannot account for  similarities in structure between independent species because:     something of the whole therefore must abide in the parts, and this  common element will be evident in some way, perhaps by the presence  of identical organs in very different organisms. (C.E., p.54)    Bergson’s theory that the élan vital  differentiates internally and is therefore able to  account for the creation of new forms and similarities in structure between independent  species is consistent with the harmonics model in which something of the whole abides  in the parts.  In Chapter 2 it was explained that concordant intervals of a musical scale  are interlocked according to proportions of an unequal ratio, the significance of which  is they apply to any key; hence the same melody can be played in different keys.  So,  while the structure is invariable melodies can be infinitely variable;110 hence Hermann’s  comment:    ...to be an initiate of the Pythagorean order [is] to realise that correspondence   and proportion rule the world. (Hermann, 2004, p. 99)    Proportion is also important for Bergson because he suggests that specific groups of  living things can be distinguished by the tendencies they emphasise:                                                                110  Chapter 2.3, p.47. </p><div id="pagenum"><p>188</p></div><p id="page">180   There is no manifestation of life which does not contain, in a rudimentary state  – either latent or potential, - the essential characters of most other  manifestations.  The difference is in the proportions.  But this very difference of  proportion will suffice to define the group … the group must not be defined by  the possession of certain characters, but by its tendency to emphasize them.   (C.E., p.106)    This is logical from the perspective of how harmonics are emphasised or de- emphasised in different musical instruments causing variations of timbre or tone colour.  A piano and a flute can play the same note but will not sound the same (Rossing, 1982,  p.114).  It will be argued that an examination of the role of number in Bergson’s  Creative Evolution  and his view of mathematics suggest that while he uses the term  “proportions”, musical proportions rather than mathematical proportions make more  sense of his argument.  The faculties of each species together with its matter evolve by  starting out as a fundamental producing its own harmonics, hence the varying  proportions, both among individual species, and between different species.  This model  also supports Bergson’s claim that increasing complexity does not arise from elements  added together, nor is it an ascending scale like steps up a ladder; he suggests rather  that evolution as duration is based on a musical theme :    We seem … to be before a musical theme , which had first been transposed, the  theme as a whole, into a certain number of tones, and on which, still the whole  theme, different variations had been played, some very simple, others very  skilful.  As to the original theme, it is everywhere and nowhere.  It is in vain  that we try to express it in terms of any idea: it must have been, originally, felt  rather than thought. (C.E., pp.171-172)    Barnard makes an important point, that sound is purely temporal; it does not have a  spatial location, being at once “everywhere and nowhere” (Barnard, 2011, p.90), and </p><div id="pagenum"><p>189</p></div><p id="page">181   Bergson’s allusion to the “original theme” being “felt rather than thought” refers to his  account of how instinct acquires its knowledge from the internal vibrations of matter.    Barnard suggests:    from the time of Creative Evolution…intuition began to be seen…as a type of  higher octave overtone or alternative to both instinct and intellect. (Barnard,  2011, p.128)    This makes sense because the élan vital  generates and possesses knowledge according  to the harmonic motion implicit in the act of intuition as explained in Chapter 5.   Bergson’s arguments for partial finalism conform to and therefore support the  musical harmonics model theory, and while Barnard has alluded to it negatively, the  subject has been otherwise neglected.  What emerges from Bergson’s argument for  partial finalism is an unplanned, but logical process that appears to conform to laws of  music and physics; hence it is necessary to determine whether the proportional nature  of Bergson’s account of the generation of multiplicity conforms to his theory of  number.        6.2    The Role of Number in Bergson’s Creative Evolution         The examination of the role of number in Bergson’s Creative Evolution  will explain  how he applies Plotinus’ concept of logos.  In Time and Free Will  Bergson replicates Plotinus’ distinction between  substantial number and monadic number with his theory of qualitative and quantitative  multiplicities.  He considers duration as a heterogeneous, intensive, and therefore  qualitative continuous multiplicity that cannot be stopped and measured, while  quantitative multiplicity is conceived as inert and measurable.  In Creative Evolution </p><div id="pagenum"><p>190</p></div><p id="page">182   Bergson explains that it is the function of intellect to produce a quantitative  multiplicity, measurable in discrete units by employing the notion of space (C.E.,  pp.210-11), and likewise, for Plotinus it is the function of the Soul to express monadic  or quantitative number spatially; the similarity is noted by Hancock:    As Plotinus’ comments regarding quantity and the other categories are  transparent in his writings, it is quite probable that Bergson took Plotinus into  account in fashioning his own view about quantity, including his views on the  quantitative limits of mechanistic science. (Hancock, 2001, p.150)    For Bergson, scientific methods employ intelligence in the act of spatialising time and  perceiving quality through quantity using ready-made concepts and language.  He  suggests we erroneously also do this with emotional states or internal sensations that  can be described as intensive because we confuse them with their external causes, e.g.  we confuse the sensation of brightness, which is a quality, with light that is external and  quantifiable.  Similarly, what we perceive to be bigger or smaller sounds are  differences in volume, which is a quality; hence we interpret the difference in intensive  magnitude, kind or quality that cannot be measured as a difference in extensive  magnitude, quantity or degree that can be measured.  It is an observation that has  ancient origins in the science of harmonics.  Andrew Barker refers to Aristoxenus ( El.  harm. 10.30–11.3) who makes exactly the same point:     most people mistakenly identify intensification of pitch (i.e. the process of  raising it, epitasis) with height of pitch ( oxytēs), and relaxation of pitch ( anesis)  with depth of pitch ( barytēs).  (Barker, 2007, p.146).    Barker also echoes Bergson in his discussion on the problem of language and  measurement in the science of harmonics:    </p><div id="pagenum"><p>191</p></div><p id="page">183   A melody, a scale or an attunement is a complex of pitched sounds, or notes,  whose pitches stand to one another in particular relations which must be  conceptualised in order to express not only their differences, but the  characteristics of the patterns they form … we speak of notes as ‘higher’ or  ‘lower’, as if they were placed as points on a vertical continuum of ‘up’ and  ‘down’, and we talk of the relations between them as larger and smaller  ‘intervals’, as if they were spatial gaps between these points of pitch, and could  be measured and compared like distances along a line.  … It is not a direct,  objective representation of the facts, but a way of thinking and talking which  arises from the contingencies of our own culture and its history. (Barker, 2007,  pp.20-21)    For Bergson, the quantification of psychic states always involves a synthesis of the one  and the many (T.F.W., p.75) because the application of numbers, each of which requires  spatial differentiation that may be actual or metaphorical, involves the notion of unity  and multiplicity.  For example, we have an immediate subjective intuition of the  number 5 as a unity in itself, but it also consists in objectifying a multiplicity of 5  homogenous units of 1 that can in turn be infinitely divided.  The notion of infinite  division underlies the idea of number itself, and the units making up number must  ignore qualitative difference, that is, they must be identical, considered static and  discontinuous, placed side by side in space.  Division as an act of separation means  jumping from one number to another while ignoring the interval in between.  Bergson proposes that while representative  sensations such as colours, shapes,  sounds, smells, tastes, textures, etc. differ, they are not separate, fixed and measurable  but merge into each other like the colours of a rainbow: “…there is simply a passing  from one to the other and not a difference in the arithmetical sense of the word”  (T.F.W., p.68).  This corresponds to his statement about number being infinitely  divisible, but not discretely divisible.  He proposes that conscious states are organically  synthesised into a dynamic flow just as a melody captures our temporal experience as a </p><div id="pagenum"><p>192</p></div><p id="page">184   continuous qualitative multiplicity (T.F.W., p.100).  Bergson however claims that the  act of counting is not purely spatial, it is durational, hence number is perceived as  quality, not quantity.  He provides an example of unconsciously hearing four strokes of  a clock, that on conscious reflection, are perceived as qualitatively different (T.F.W.,  pp.127-128), and furthermore, that number arises from qualitative difference.  Čapek  notes this act is durational and has a ‘dialectical’ character due to the two sides of the  process (Čapek, 1971, pp.178-179).  Bergson states:     the process by which we count units and make them into a discrete multiplicity  has two sides; on the one hand we assume that they are identical, which is  conceivable only on condition that these units are arranged alongside each other  in a homogenous medium; but on the other hand the third unit, for example,  when added to the other two, alters the nature and rhythm of the whole; without  this interpenetration and this, so to speak, qualitative progress, no addition  would be possible . (T.F.W., p.123)    In claiming that quantitative multiplicity depends on qualitative multiplicity Bergson  replicates Plotinus’ claim that monadic number depends on the existence of substantial  number.  While duration contains number ‘potentially’ (T.F.W., p.121), number is  generated when it is actualized in space, thus Bergson’s assertion:    the mathematical order arises automatically when within the whole a partial  interruption or inversion is produced … this power of creation once given …has  only to be diverted from itself to relax its tension, only to relax its tension to  extend, only to extend for the mathematical order of the elements so  distinguished and the inflexible determinism connecting them to manifest the  interruption of the creative act: in fact, inflexible determinism and mathematical  order are one with this very interruption. (C.E., p.217-218)    As explained in Chapter 5, interruption arises naturally in the generation of harmonics  in the form of nodes, and it was noted that Bergson refers to the impulse of </p><div id="pagenum"><p>193</p></div><p id="page">185   consciousness as the ascending movement, thus representing the vital order, and matter  as the descending movement, where inversion and interruption are analogous, but  where interruption comes to represent the geometrical.  The vital and geometrical  therefore represent two sides of reality, just as the production of harmonics has its  geometrical aspect as determined by the monochord for example, where numbers are  generated in a descending series as reciprocals of the ascending series of whole  numbers generated in its vital aspect when the vibrations are generated from the  fundamental.111  By returning to Figure 20  it can be understood that  numbers are  generated at the same time as the nodes (interruption), therefore changing the rhythm of  the whole.112  Plotinus uses this model for the generation of logos, substantial number  and form in Intellect, a model that he also refers to as a melody, and in Creative  Evolution  Bergson acknowledges that he is following Plotinus’ theory of logos:    Our comparison does no more than develop the content of the term λόγος, as  Plotinus understands it. For while the λόγος of this philosopher is a generating  and informing power, an aspect or a fragment of the ψυχή, on the other hand  Plotinus sometimes speaks of it as of a discourse . More generally, the relation  that we establish in the present chapter between "extension" and "detension"  resembles in some aspects that which Plotinus supposes. (C.E., fn., p.210)    Bergson proceeds to criticise Plotinus for following Plato in erecting mathematical  essences into absolute realities rather than incorporating them into the durational  process.  Hude remarks that Bergson’s lectures on Plotinus were given after the  publication of Matter and Memory  and are contemporaneous with the preparation for  Creative Evolution (Hude, 2000, p.7).113  Although Bergson was obviously aware of                                                                111  Chapter 2.3, Figure 4, p.48.  112  Chapter 5.3, Figure 20, p.165.  113  Appendix 3, p.3.   </p><div id="pagenum"><p>194</p></div><p id="page">186   Ennead VI ‘On Number’ because he was critical of mathematical essences being  erected into absolute realities and understood the nature of Plotinus’ logos to be  substantial number and form, curiously he failed to mention or explain it in his lectures  and talks on Plotinus, despite referring specifically to the vibrations in Soul (Hude,  2000, p.72).114  In his lecture on Plotinus he refers to it as “a principle that unites the  multiplicity; it is the λόγoς έν οπέρματι, the generative reason” (Hude, 2000, pp.30-31),  a term, which as noted in Chapter 3, is ambiguously interpreted by modern scholars of  Plotinus.115  He also refers to Plotinus’  logos in his address to the University of  Edinburgh entitled ‘The Problem of Personality’; however, while he acknowledges: “In  the centre of all this metaphysic is the concept of λόγος”, not once does he mention it  refers to Plotinus’ account of substantial number and form ( Mélanges , p.1,056).  It  seems as if Bergson’s ambiguity is deliberate, and a theory of why this is so is proposed  in the Conclusion.116   We have seen that in Creative Evolution,  living beings possess tendencies  according to the proportions they emphasise; however, Bergson first reconciled quality  and quantity under the auspices of duration as vibrations of consciousness and matter  respectively, in Matter and Memory :    By the idea of tension we have striven to overcome the opposition between  quality and quantity. (M.M., p.330)                                                                  114  Appendix 4, p.48.  Here Bergson states: “But for Plotinus perception is sympathy of the        organ with the object with which it vibrates in unison”.    115  Chapter 3.4, p.83-84    116  Conclusion, pp.307-308. </p><div id="pagenum"><p>195</p></div><p id="page">187   It was noted in Bergson’s notion of association that consciousness condenses the  vibrations of matter within its own duration, and he provides an example of perceiving a  red light that vibrates at a rate of 400 billion times a second:    Thus the sensation of red light, experienced by us in the course of a second,  corresponds in itself to a succession of phenomena which, separately  distinguished in our duration with the greatest possible economy of time, would  occupy more than 250 centuries of our history. (M.M., p.272)    Gunter notes the arithmetical relationship between them has “an objective basis” and  “an element of quantitative commensurability”.  It is “the indivisibility of the rhythms,  of both sorts, which grounds the possibility of quantitative relations” (Gunter, 1999).   Bergson acknowledges that modern physics reveals “differences in number behind our  distinctions of quality” (‘Introduction II’, in C.M., p.58-59), and if consciousness is  generated in the same way as matter, differences of number must be behind the  proportionality of consciousness.  For Bergson these numbers make the interaction of  mind and matter intelligible as qualities, as noted by Deleuze:    And qualities belong to matter as much as to ourselves: They belong to matter,  they are in matter, by virtue of the vibrations and numbers that punctuate them  internally. (Deleuze, 1991, pp.87-88)    Furthermore, Deleuze comments:    One of Bergson's more curious ideas is that difference itself has a number, a  virtual number, a numbering number. (Deleuze, 2004, p.34)     In A Thousand Plateaus  Deleuze makes a distinction between the ‘numbered numbers’  belonging to striated space and the ‘numbering numbers’ pertaining to smooth space.   For him numbering numbers are ordinal, dividing themselves without changing their  nature on each division, the units of which represent distances, not magnitudes (Deleuze </p><div id="pagenum"><p>196</p></div><p id="page">188   & Guattari, 2004, p.535).  While Deleuze’s numbering number sounds very much like  Pythagorean qualitative numbers in time measuring distances between musical  intervals, Deleuze is thinking purely of virtual space, the ontological potential condition  underlying the actualisation of extended space.  Bergson is consistent with Plotinus who  applies the term ‘numbering number’ to monadic number which is spatial, while  ‘numbered numbers’ are whole numbers that are not divided and whose temporal  differences can be represented as ratios.  For Plotinus numbered numbers are measures  not measured, and this appears to be an appropriate understanding of the numbers  punctuating duration.   There is no explicit evidence that Bergson linked Plotinus’ theory  of number to Pythagorean harmonics, however the connection could not have escaped  him since Plotinus acknowledged the Pythagorean influence, and Bergson lectured on  Pythagorean philosophy as well as Plotinus.  The subject of number leads to an  examination of the subject of Bergson’s attitude towards mathematics.          6.3   Bergson and Mathematics         The Pythagoreans clearly distinguished between the mathematics of space, geometry,  and the mathematics of time, musical harmonics, and similarly Bergson distinguishes  the geometrical and the vital orders.  He is emphatic that the mathematics of space  cannot account for duration because it is “concerned only with the ends of the intervals  and not with the intervals themselves” (C.E., p.9); he even states that mathematics  “goes beyond its province when it claims to reconstruct what takes place in the interval  between two simultaneities” (T.F.W., p.115).  It will be argued that the mathematics of  harmonics is consistent with Bergson’s theory of duration and the logos of Plotinus as  discussed in the previous section.  </p><div id="pagenum"><p>197</p></div><p id="page">189   Despite Bergson’s statements about the shortcomings of mathematics, Deleuze  hypothesised that his accounts of continuous and discrete multiplicities are influenced  by Riemann’s distinction between discrete and continuous manifolds (Deleuze, 1991,  pp.39-40).117  Deleuze is often quoted by commentators looking for a definitive  mathematical influence on Bergson, but perhaps Riemann’s influence on Bergson  should be approached with caution.  Duffy explains that  Riemann’s theory, proposed in  his ‘Habilitationsvortrag’ entitled ‘On the Hypotheses which Lie at the Foundations of  Geometry’, differentiates between two concepts of magnitude: a discrete magnitude  consists of individual elements whose metrical relations are determined by the number  of elements belonging to it, that is, quantity determined by counting,  while a  continuous manifold is three dimensional, like a continuous path that consists of points  that “appear solely in relation to some continuous ambient background, whether actual  or implied, such as a line or a plane”.  An example of a point would be the positions of  perceived objects which are “compared to one another with regard to quantity by  measuring” (Duffy, 2013, p.103).  Plotnitsky explains that Riemann’s theory applies to  the geometry and topology of space.  It is a ‘conceptual mathematics’ in which  Riemann pursues ‘a conception of space as a continuous three-dimensional manifold,  such as a sphere:    [which] is a conglomerate of (local) spaces, each of which can be mapped by a  (flat) Euclidean, or Cartesian coordinate map, and treated accordingly (and thus  also given geometry), without allowing for a global Euclidean structure for the  whole or a single coordinate system for the whole, except in the limited case of  a Euclidean homogenous (flat) space itself. (Plotnitsky, 2009, p.108)                                                                  117  This view is supported by Durie (Durie, 2004). </p><div id="pagenum"><p>198</p></div><p id="page">190   Riemann’s concept of a discrete manifold may be similar to Bergson’s discrete  multiplicity; however, the spatial nature of Riemann’s continuous manifold does not  apply to duration which implies succession and interpenetration, not externality of  spaces within a continuum; hence Duffy comments:     While at first glance this appears to correlate quite closely with the Riemannian  account, however, upon closer inspection it is apparent that what Bergson  leaves out of his account is the very spatial nature of Riemann’s qualitative  multiplicity. (Duffy, 2013, p.107)    It is strange that Deleuze proposed the influence of Riemann on Bergson while also  suggesting that Bergson “did not feel able to pursue the mathematical implications of a  theory of multiplicities” (Deleuze, 1991, p.39); in fact, it was Deleuze himself who  followed Riemann in associating the concept of a qualitative multiplicity with space as  well as time.   Bergson introduced ambiguity as to the nature of durational number by accepting  the validity of quantitative calculus in scientific enquiry, suggesting:    metaphysics should adopt the generative idea of our mathematics in order to  extend it to all qualities, that is, to reality in general. (‘Introduction to  Metaphysics’, in C.M., p.190)    Furthermore, he proposes:    one of the objects of metaphysics is to operate differentiations and qualitative  integrations. (C.M., p.191)    Bergson’s reference to modern calculus led Gunter to conclude that Bergson develops a  ‘qualitative calculus’ on the model of the infinitesimal calculus of mathematics enabling  him to differentiate the real parts of consciousness and break it down into a hierarchy of  durations (Gunter, 1999).  This is linked to the French mathematician Jean Baptiste </p><div id="pagenum"><p>199</p></div><p id="page">191   Joseph Fourier, who in 1822 published his theorem that any regularly repetitive motion  and any wave, irrespective of the complication of its form, can be treated as the sum of  a series of simple harmonic motions or waves  (Roederer, 2008, p.127).  While Gunter  does not specifically refer to Fourier, it makes sense that the mathematical order to  which he refers is that applicable to harmonic motion.  Bergson was an adept  mathematician who recognised the importance of the revolution that arose in  mathematics and the sciences resulting from the development of infinitesimal calculus  by Newton and Leibniz, because it was the first tool that made the mathematical  modelling of continuous change possible.  He also states that metaphysics, in adopting  the method of modern calculus, “will in no way proceed to universal mathematics, that  chimera of modern philosophy” (‘Introduction to Metaphysics’, in C.M., p.190)’, which  led Gunter to concur with Jean Millet, who proposes that Bergson regards it as an  “epistemological archetype” (Millet, 1987, pp.33-34).118  Although Bergson considers  calculus to be the most accurate tool for scientifically  measuring the nature of matter, he  also considers its methodology to be “unstable” since it fails to capture the dynamic  nature of duration.  In Creative Evolution  Bergson describes how the mathematician  excludes flowing time because he calculates the state of a system at static moments:      In short, the world the mathematician deals with is a world that dies and is  reborn at every instant – the world that Descartes was thinking of when he  spoke of continued creation. (C.E., p.22)    The problem arises because the interval between the static moments is excluded.  He  agrees with George Berkeley, who in The Analyst , attacked the logical foundations of  Newton’s calculus and “fluxions”, and Leibniz’s notion of infinitesimal change, both of                                                                118  See also: Millet, J., 1974     </p><div id="pagenum"><p>200</p></div><p id="page">192   which dealt with change in terms of continuous magnitudes as a succession of infinitely  small jumps rather than a continuous flow.  Berkeley asked:    And what are these fluxions? … They are neither finite quantities, nor quantities  infinitely small, nor yet nothing.  May we not call them the ghosts of departed  quantities? (Berkeley, 1734, pp.59 - XXXV)    This criticism also applies to Fourier’s mathematics of harmonics that relies on spatial  superposition, a notion that Bergson would ultimately reject because it is geometric  (C.E., p.218).  Calculus is the key method for solving any problem of change and  principally consists in three steps: (1) Divide a problem in differential quantities. (2)  Solve the problem for each differential quantity. (3) Integrate to sum up all the  differential quantities.  There is however, an alternative explanation of calculus that  was proposed in the account of Bergson’s partial finalism, the 3-stage generative  structure of Pythagorean cosmology: (1) There is an undifferentiated unity; (2) From  this unity two opposite powers are separated out to form the world order; (3) The two  opposites unite again to generate life (Cornford, 1923, p.3).119  This process of  qualitative differentiation and integration is linked to the Pythagorean tetractys, the  ultimate symbol of calculus, a pebble diagram that represented the generative nature of  reality as a temporal and qualitative evolution of the many out of the One,120 a model  much more in line with Bergson’s concept of duration as a melody, especially as it  contains the harmonic ratios that underlie the mathematical harmony of the musical  scale.  Bergson argues that the latent geometry underpinning the mathematics applied  by science to the study of nature takes account of simultaneities without succession or                                                                119  Chapter 2.1.4, p.39; Chapter 6.1, pp.177-178.    120  Calculus is a Latin word meaning "pebble or stone" (as it is still used in medicine and  dentistry) and indicates that pebbles (prehistorically and later) were used to "calculate."   </p><div id="pagenum"><p>201</p></div><p id="page">193   duration (C.E., pp.210-11), hence in his view: “there is no definite system of  mathematical laws, at the base of nature” (C.E., p.219).  However, he claims that there  is an objective order “approximately mathematical immanent in matter, an order, which  our science approaches in proportion to its progress” (C.E., p.218).  This could be  related to the fact that by the middle of the eighteenth century music, or more  specifically musical harmonics, was no longer considered a mathematical science  applicable to the scientific study of nature, as explained in Chapter 1; however, in its  study of the physics of acoustics, the mathematics of which pertains to the scientific  notion of a vibratory universe, science was ‘approaching’ the mathematics of music.   As noted in Chapter 5, for Bergson the order in space differs to the order in time,121 and  as his ‘law of dichotomy’ generates proportions that are underpinned by number, the  number he refers to as that used in its geometrical aspect of mathematics must be  applied differently from that used in its durational aspect.  While he does not discuss  the nature of number underlying the vital order, the numbers of musical harmonics  make most sense of his theory because they fill the intervals and reflect the temporal,  qualitative and substantial nature of duration.  This is consistent with the logos of  Plotinus as discussed above and the Pythagoreans who made a similar distinction  between the mathematics applying to the geometrical and vital orders; geometry was  considered the mathematics of space and musical harmonics, the mathematics of time  (Guthrie, 1988, p.34).  It is noteworthy that Bergson refers to duration as the  ‘uninterrupted humming of life’s depths’ (Perception of Change, in C.M., p.150),  which could be interpreted as an implicit reference to a quotation commonly attributed  to Pythagoras, though the source is unknown:                                                                  121  Chapter 5.2, p.151. </p><div id="pagenum"><p>202</p></div><p id="page">194   There is geometry in the humming of the strings , there is music in the spacing  of the spheres.122    The Pythagorean influence on Bergson is purely speculative because he never mentions  them as one of his positive influences; therefore, the next task is to assess his attitude to  Pythagorean number theory and their philosophy in general by scrutinising the lectures  he gave on Greek philosophy.        6.4   Bergson and Pythagorean Number Theory        Bergson’s ‘Lecture on the Pythagoreans’ reveals an understanding of and sympathy  with Pythagorean number theory.123  He draws upon several sources including  Philolaus and Stobaeus; however, he relies heavily on Aristotle because he considers  his texts to be authentic.  At the start of his ‘exposition of the system’ Bergson makes  the following statement:    The principle of Pythagoreanism is clear in Aristotle ( Metaphysics , I, 5).   Mathematical principles are the principles of things, and the elements of  numbers are the elements of all beings.  Everything is explained. (Hude, 2000,  p.182)124    Bergson firstly addresses the statement that mathematical principles are the principles  of things and considers whether number is substance or attribute.  He points to  contradictory statements in Aristotle: Physics III, 4 refers to number as substance and  not an attribute; it is bound to sensible things in such a way that it cannot be mentally                                                                122  As quoted in the preface of the book entitled Music of the Spheres  by Guy Murchie (1961).   123  A translation of this lecture is provided in Appendix 2.    124  Appendix 2, p.3. </p><div id="pagenum"><p>203</p></div><p id="page">195   abstracted, i.e. that things are numbers, or that number would be the immanent principle  of things, whilst Metaphysics  I, 6 states things exist by imitation of numbers and Plato  merely substitutes the notion of ‘participation’ (μέθεξις) for the Pythagorean notion of  ‘imitation’ (μίμησις).  This latter point seems to be confirmed by Stobaeus:    I know, he said, that many consider Pythagoras as having said that things arise  from number, but in reality, Pythagoras did not say that things come from  number, but that they are according to number, κατ'άριθμόν. (Stobaeus,  Eclogae, I.302, in Hude, 2000, p.183)125    Bergson notes: “According to some critics and Brandis in particular, there would be the  two opposing tendencies”; however, he refers again to Aristotle who states: “Because  the Pythagoreans found a resemblance between numbers and things, they accepted that  number is the principle of things” ( Metaphysics , I.5).  Bergson acknowledges this  reconciling statement as a likely truth, i.e. the Pythagoreans confused “simple  resemblance and identity … Perceiving that things are subject to precise mathematical  relationships that had the character of number, they concluded they were numbers”.  He  further adds:    In fact the Pythagoreans, having not yet distinguished a metaphysical principle  from a material principle, had not realised that the reality of things and their  intelligibility are two separate things; perceiving that number is the condition  for the intelligibility of things, they concluded that number constituted the  substance, the matter of things.  Number is a metaphysical principle used as  material principle by philosophers who did not make the distinction. (Hude,  2000, p.184)126                                                                  125  Appendix 2, p.4.   126  Appendix 2, pp.4-5 </p><div id="pagenum"><p>204</p></div><p id="page">196   Having acknowledged the metaphysical nature of number, Bergson then attempts to  resolve a further confusion about Aristotle’s statement that the Pythagoreans considered  units to have magnitude or extension, and that it is a contradiction for material bodies to  have the form of number.  Bergson criticises Aristotle for interpreting his predecessors  based on his own ideas, i.e. likeness only explains likeness, or “extended elements are  needed to explain extended things”.  He suggests we would have to reject the materialist  interpretation of German historians Reinhold and Brandis, as well as a different theory  proposed by Ritter, that although number is immaterial, the Pythagoreans considered  material bodies to be geometric properties that would be represented by number, that is,  the unit would be the point and numbers would represent relationships of a spatial  magnitude.  Bergson rejects this theory because it would not have been possible before  Democritus:    This way, the point would be identified with the atom.  However, the atom is a  direct product of the eclecticism subsequent to Pythagoreanism. (Hude, 2000,  p.185)127    Bergson prefers Aristotle’s contention that number is substantial and purely  mathematical, i.e., having no magnitude.  In his ‘Introduction’, Hude comments that in  his lecture Bergson relies heavily on Zeller for both content and references, and that  Bergson used Boutroux’s translation of Zeller (Hude, 2000, p.11).128  In Zeller’s text,  following his reference to Ritter, he makes some interesting comments that Bergson                                                                127  Appendix 2, p.5.   128  Appendix 1, p.2.

Even harmony could no longer have had the great significance that it possessed  for the Pythagoreans, since the relations of tones were never reduced by them to  space relations. (Zeller, 1881, pp.416-417)    Bergson then addresses the issue of how the Pythagoreans applied number to make it  the general explanation of things, referring to the Pythagorean table of opposites and  the conception of harmony (proportion) as that which brings the opposites together.  It  is noteworthy that the differentiation and integration of opposites later become key  concepts in his work.     In his lecture, Bergson was quite sympathetic to the notion of Pythagorean  number mysticism, in which each of the numbers was perceived to have a meaning  attributed to its quality or ‘energy’ thus providing a correspondence between sensibility  and intelligibility.  Rather than dismissing the theory as outright nonsense, he saw  ‘method’ in what many consider to be madness:    it should not be assumed that these connections are always made without  method. (Hude, 2000, p.188)129                                                                   129  Appendix 2, p.8. </p><div id="pagenum"><p>206</p></div><p id="page">198   Bergson’s sympathetic reading is reflected in his theory that  “Creation signifies, above  all emotion” (T.S.M.R., p.45), because emotion is linked to the power of qualitative  change or the ‘meaning’ that lies in the intervals.  In Time and Free Will  Bergson  proposes that the qualitative nature of numbers has an emotional equivalent:    When we explicitly count units by stringing them along a spatial line, is it not  the case that, alongside this addition of identical terms standing out from a  homogeneous background, an organisation of these units is going on in the  depths of the soul, a wholly dynamic process, not unlike the purely qualitative  way in which an anvil, if it could feel, would realize a series of blows from a  hammer?  In this sense we might almost say that the numbers in daily use have  each their emotional equivalent. (T.F.W., p.123)    Bergson’s example of an anvil and hammer could possibly be another reference to  Pythagoras, because Iamblichus tells us that it was hearing the notes produced by the  sounds of differing sized hammers striking an anvil that inspired Pythagoras to  investigate the musical intervals.  Bergson proceeds to note that tradesmen are aware  that when pricing goods we notice a qualitative difference between £4.99 and £5.00 for  example (T.F.W., p.123).  Furthermore, in The Two Sources of Morality and Religion  Bergson’s intention is to link states of emotion to moral dispositions, proposing that  emotions are prefigured in nature as “harmonics” arousing in us elementary feelings  that are almost sensations:    They are recognisable because they are destined to spur us on to acts answering  to needs.  The others, on the contrary, are real inventions, comparable to those  of the musician.  ……But a fresh emotion, surely has arisen and used pre- existing notes as harmonics.  (T.S.M.R., p.41)    He suggests this is what Rousseau did with the emotion prefigured in mountains.   Harmonics also underpin his arguments In Laughter: </p><div id="pagenum"><p>207</p></div><p id="page">199   Here we have the first illustration of a law which will appear with increasing  distinctness as we proceed with our task. When a musician strikes a note on an  instrument, other notes start up of themselves, not so loud as the first, yet  connected with it by certain definite relations, which coalesce with it and  determine its quality. These are what are called in physics the overtones of the  fundamental note. It would seem that comic fancy, even in its most far-fetched  inventions, obeys a similar law. ( Laughter, p.27)    Furthermore, he suggests:    an emotion may be said to be dramatic and contagious when all the harmonics  in it are heard along with the fundamental note. ( Laughter, p.69)    While Bergson does not explicitly link numbers to emotion in these passages, the  reference to harmonics, notably musical harmonics, and his assertion that numbers  have an emotional equivalent must be considered alongside his view that there are  differences in number behind our distinctions of quality.          6.5 Bergson and Pythagorean Philosophy        It was noted in Chapter 1 that Bergson feels at ease with Greek philosophers;130  however other than Plotinus he gives no hint of being influenced by them.  It is  noticeable that he never criticises philosophy before the Eleatics but is very critical of  philosophy from the time of the school of Elea and subsequently, Plato.  In ‘The  Perception of Change’ Bergson writes:    The conceptions of the earliest Greek thinkers were certainly very close to  perception, since it was by the transformations of a sensible element like water,  air or fire, that they completed the immediate sensation.  But from the time the                                                                130  Chapter 1.3, p.29. </p><div id="pagenum"><p>208</p></div><p id="page">200   philosophers of the school of Elea, criticising the idea of transformation, had  shown or thought they had shown the impossibility of keeping so close to the  sense data, philosophy started off along the road it has since travelled, the road  to a “supra-sensible” world: one was to explain things henceforth with pure  ideas. (‘The Perception of Change’, C.M., p.132)    Bergson’s main problem with philosophy from the time of the Eleatics was that they  rejected the emphasis on sense data and criticised the idea of ‘transformation’, the  philosophy of Pythagoreanism.  Bergson regards his philosophy to be true empiricism  and he makes “transformation” a key theme in Creative Evolution (C.E., pp.230-231).   Number atomism and a distrust of the senses first emerges with the Eleatic school, and  Cornford comments: “it is generally admitted that Zeno’s arguments are directed  against the Pythagoreans” (Cornford, 1923, p.7; p.11).  This view is consistent with  Bergson’s, that geometry always involves spatialization; hence while Zeno’s project is  to demonstrate that continuous becoming is impossible, for Bergson the paradoxes  serve to demonstrate the intellect’s inability to conceive motion other than as a series  of discrete states and the impossibility of representing absolute duration or the mobility  of movement.  Bergson was also aware that by way of music the Pythagoreans found an  underlying structure that led to the conclusion all relationships could be regulated by  the same harmonious principles, and as noted in Chapter 2, music formed a bridge  between the inner and outer cosmos.  Through their empirical investigation of musical  harmony, they determined that musical ratios were not just perceived by the sense of  hearing; they could be apprehended by the mind as number in time, as noted by  Hermann:        </p><div id="pagenum"><p>209</p></div><p id="page">201   The discernment between agreeable and disagreeable sounds was no longer the  exclusive domain of one’s ears.  One could also determine these ratios by  entirely intelligible means. (Hermann, 2004, p.94)    The Pythagoreans instigated a shift in Plato’s philosophic inquiry away from  materialistic cosmologies of the earlier Ionic tradition to the consideration of form.   Aristotle said that what differentiates Plato from the Pythagoreans is separation  (Metaphysics , 989b 29) or the introduction of the Forms ( Metaphysics , 987b 31) which  he traces back to the dialectic developed by Socrates.  Plato’s ideas are criticised by  Bergson in Creative Evolution  because he identifies the theory as a product of the  function of intellect and language that separate the parts from the whole, suggesting  that Plato’s dialectic laid the foundation for separating qualities and quantities (C.E.,  pp.314-328).  Bergson’s criticism of Plato could also be linked to the prioritisation that  Plato ‘appears’ to give to mathematics over the science of harmonics.  In Republic  (529b-531a) Plato prioritises the harmony of mathematics over that of the harmony of  music played on instruments because in his view ideal and abstract mathematical  relations are not present in material objects.  He criticises the Pythagoreans for  focusing too much on the actual sound of musical intervals, and not concentrating  enough on the silent harmony of pure numbers.131  It is possible that Bergson shared  Burkert’s view that Plato distorted the empirical nature of the Pythagorean tradition:     The problem of the Pythagorean tradition lies in Platonism, for Platonizing  interpretation took the place of historical reality.  One can only guess at the  reasons why Plato and his pupils saw themselves as continuators of  Pythagoreanism. (Burkert, 1972, p.92)                                                                    131  See: Guthrie, 1962, pp.161-162. </p><div id="pagenum"><p>210</p></div><p id="page">202   If, as has been proposed, Bergson’s transformational philosophy is founded on the  science of harmonics, it is possible that underlying his criticism of Plato was the  thought that the death knell for Pythagoreanism was rung by Plato, and from that time  intellect dominated the fields of science and mathematics.  Pythagorean harmonics and  a philosophy of transformation were forgotten until they were revived by Plotinus in the  form of logos in which movement and change is implicated, and which Bergson adopts  as central to the evolution of the élan vital.  Having said that, neither Plato nor Plotinus  neglected the empirical; while Plotinus cannot be described as an empiricist he  described how forms perceived empirically by musicians, can lead us to the nature of  the forms in Intellect (Ennead I.3.1, 20-35),132 in the same way that Plato said that  geometers use visible forms to lead them to their intelligible paradigms ( Republic VI,  510d-e).  However, for Bergson, it was Plotinus’ concept of logos that differentiated  him from Plato, and while he criticises Plato in particular for proposing a philosophy  based on the notion of static ideas existing in eternity, he considered it an error that  Plotinus tried to ‘fix’, and this is why he excluded Plotinus from his criticism of Greek  philosophy in Creative Evolution (C.E., p.326, fn.).  The examination of Bergson’s theory of multiplicity in this Chapter as well as  Chapter 5 has brought to light that there are inferred references suggesting a possible  Pythagorean influence on Bergson, and a further example is found in The Two Sources  of Morality and Religion.  Bergson proposes that life proceeds by progress and  oscillation between opposites, or what he refers to as the ‘ law of twofold frenzy ’  (T.S.M.R., p.296), that life has become complex and will swing in the opposite  direction to a simpler life.  He refers specifically to vegetarianism and the idea that  science will prove he is ‘directly and slowly poisoning’ himself ‘by eating meat’,                                                                132  Chapter 8.2.2, p.244. </p><div id="pagenum"><p>211</p></div><p id="page">203   though oddly, he adds a footnote to say that he chose the example of meat as he might  have that of any other food, as if he anticipated his reference would lead us to think of  an inference to Pythagoreanism (T.S.M.R., pp.300-301).  The fact is, he chose ‘meat’,  not any other food.  In the light of all the other evidence linking Bergson to  Pythagoreanism, it is appropriate to speculate that the return to a simple ‘vegetarian’ life  could symbolise a return to a philosophy of transformation like that of the vegetarian  Pythagoreans whose philosophy he was influenced by.        6.6   Bergson and Metaphor        Bergson makes various explicit references to harmonics as well as melody in his work;  however, the common view is they are purely metaphorical, as noted by Edward  Campbell who refers to Marcel (Marcel, 2005, p.86, pp.88-89):    In 1925 Gabriel Marcel argued convincingly that Bergsonian duration does not  accurately encapsulate musical experience.  Bergson had not set out to develop  a theory of musical time or duration, and he used the example of melody only  metaphorically. (Campbell, 2014, p.229)    The Pythagorean influence on Bergson has also been rejected by Barnard, who in his  chapter entitled ‘Melodies of the Self and the World’ offers an enlightening description  of how Bergson sees reality as a “vast ongoing musical creation” while considering it a  metaphor that excludes any likeness to the Pythagorean music of the spheres:     Instead of envisioning the universe as the rigorously formulaic manifestation of  some Pythagorean regularity, as the terrestrial echo of the “music of the  spheres” in which matter obeys the preset “score” given by the Laws of Nature,  why not think of physical reality as a complex jazz performance in which old  standards are frequently performed (making them “habits” rather than “laws of </p><div id="pagenum"><p>212</p></div><p id="page">204   nature”), even if, periodically and regularly, something unexpected also occurs,  something genuinely new takes place as the adaptive result of different  individuals and groups responding to and interacting with each other. (Barnard,  2011, p.92)    Barnard gives the impression that law does not apply to Bergson’s creative evolution  and that a law of harmonics, which is “formulaic”, cannot account for spontaneous  novelty and freedom through constructive and destructive interference.  Most musicians  base their spontaneous creations on pre-existing scales from which they are free to  choose the notes to play.  He also provides a distorted impression of Pythagorean  philosophy as being “pre-set” and rigid, whereas it proposes that human action can  counter the effects of nature by awareness of the natural energy encountered daily, a  view also held by Bergson, as will be discussed in Chapter 9.  It is also significant that several of Bergson’s arguments have a basis within the  ancient science of harmonics, particularly that of Aristoxenus who, as explained in  Chapter 2,133 considered melody to possess power (δύναμις) that is essentially  qualitative and implicated in its succession and continuity (συνέχεια), because notes  have their own dynamic properties or functions that determine the progress of a melody  in terms of its intervals.  Similarly, while there is no evidence that Bergson read  Aristoxenus, he proposes that organised matter evolves and has continuity due to its  power in terms of ‘genetic energy’ (C.E., p.27) that varies with its function.  It was  noted in section 6.2134 that Bergson employs the claims of Aristoxenus in his argument  that scientific methods employ intelligence that uses ready-made concepts and  language, and in his number theory, we interpret the difference in intensive magnitude,                                                                133  Chapter 2.4, pp.52-53.  134  Chapter 6.2, pp.182-183. </p><div id="pagenum"><p>213</p></div><p id="page">205   kind or quality that cannot be measured, as a difference in extensive magnitude,  quantity or degree that can be measured.135  While Bergson appears to be influenced by  Pythagorean harmonics, he appears to combine it with the more empirical Aristoxenian  theory in a way that is not found in the Enneads.     Commentators appear to assume that Bergson’s philosophy is not literally  based on music or harmonics; however, in The Creative Mind , Bergson’s opening  words are: ‘What philosophy has lacked most of all is precision (‘Introduction I’, in  C.M., p.11), so if precision is his primary concern, why would he say that duration or  the inner life “is that very melody” (‘Introduction I’, in C.M., p.19), or that our  personality is “precisely the continuous melody of our inner life” (‘The Perception of  Change’, C.M.,  p.149) if he intended the melody to be taken metaphorically?  For  Bergson intuition, which is durational, pre-exists intellect which thinks in terms of  space.  The intellect has to use spatial metaphors to explain that which is experienced  immediately through intuition; however, as Harris notes, Bergson struggles to explain  duration using spatial metaphors:    Bergson proposes one explanatory metaphor for duration after another, only to  find them inadequate, if not deceptive. In essence, we find that Bergson lacks  any notion of “space” or spatial metaphors which would accommodate the  definitive characteristics of his concept of multiplicity. The chief impasse lies in  that fact that qualitative or continuous multiplicity entails “reciprocal  penetration,” a tangled weave of sorts, and Bergson could not find a visual or  spatial analogue because he equated space in general with the Euclidean space  of common sense. (Harris, 2004, p.102)                                                                  135  Chapter 9 will also claim that Bergson follows Aristoxenus in implicating the necessity of  perception and memory in the theory of continuity (p.261-262).  See also Chapter 2.4, p.53.   </p><div id="pagenum"><p>214</p></div><p id="page">206   Not only are spatial metaphors ineffective in explaining duration, in Creative Evolution   Bergson states that the intellect will essentially regard duration as metaphorical:    It is of the very essence of mechanism, in fact, to consider as metaphorical  every expression which attributes to time an effective action and a reality of its  own.  (C.E., p.16)    In The Creative Mind  Bergson suggests that spatial metaphors or images can bring  forth an intuition of duration; however, they have to be different with a possibility of  convergence due to them having “the same degree of tension”.  Difference is needed to  prevent any one of them from taking the place of the intended intuition, but together  they gradually bring consciousness to a position where the intuition will be unveiled  (‘Introduction to Metaphysics’, in C.M., p.166).  So, we can acquire an intuition of  duration by using spatial metaphors that appear to converge; however, they have to be  different.  In the light of what Bergson writes about the need for spatial metaphors it is  understandable that commentators assume that he has no other means of describing  duration; however, it is suggested that his spatial metaphors form part of the process of  ‘unveiling’ or initiation for the reader who is possibly not yet ready to see the light, and  as was explained in Chapter 1, the information is not explicitly given because initiation  is a journey of discovery that the student has to undertake for him/herself.  On the other  hand, his reference to duration as melody is temporal rather than spatial and brings  consciousness to an immediate and “precise” understanding, which is why he repeats it.   Once again, he hints at the notion of harmonics but does not describe it explicitly in in  his theory of duration and intuition.  The analysis of his arguments for partial finalism,  his theory of number, his rejection of mathematics as having the ability to account for  duration, his sympathy with Pythagorean number theory and philosophy, the veiled </p><div id="pagenum"><p>215</p></div><p id="page">207   Pythagorean inferences, together with his insistence on precision, suggests that duration  conceived as melody is not metaphorical because the harmonic principles underpinning  it are precisely those that underpin his theory of the élan vital  and duration as a  temporal process.  In Chapter 4 it was noted that Plotinus is more explicit about  harmonic principles when describing the nature of Soul; however, he never uses  musical metaphors when describing the generation and nature of Being, Intellect  and  matter, because the process itself is not metaphorical; hence his reliance on metaphors  of light and vision to explain it.  Bergson appears to adopt a similar approach; he is  slightly more open in his musical references in his account of partial finalism but uses  metaphors of fireworks and shells in his account of the division of the élan vital.  While  it is possible to question Plotinus’ understanding of the mechanism of harmonics, there  is no doubt about Bergson’s knowledge because he was explicit about it, particularly in  Laughter, where he refers to harmonics pertinent to optics as well as music, and later in   The Two Sources of Morality and Religion .  The increasing frequency of explicit  references to harmonics, particularly in the latter book, possibly reflects a growing  confidence in his theory due to scientific developments.  In The Creative Mind ,  published in 1934, he comments:    When I began to write, physics had not yet made the decisive advances which  were to bring a change in its ideas on the structure of matter …The great  theoretical discoveries of recent years have led physicists to suppose a kind of  fusion between the wave and the corpuscle – between substance and movement  (C.M., ‘Introduction II’, p.71-72).    While electromagnetic wave theory originated with the work of Maxwell in the latter  half of the nineteenth century, according to the electric and magnetic equations  postulated by Maxwell, electromagnetic fields resemble a wave in both structure and  action (Maxwell, 1865, p.466).  Theories of the harmonic oscillation of matter began </p><div id="pagenum"><p>216</p></div><p id="page">208   with De Broglie’s discovery in 1925 that electrons are both particles and waves of  vibration complete with harmonics and overtones that follow the same property and  characteristics of vibration as the vibrating string of a musical instrument (Root- Bernstein & Root-Bernstein, 1999, p.139).  In 1925, Heisenberg, Born, and Jordan  expressed the quantum field's internal degrees of freedom as an infinite set of harmonic  oscillators and in 1927 Schrödinger wrote down an equation for quantum waves  (Heisenberg Society, 2017).            Conclusion        This Chapter argued that Bergson’s harmonics of evolution are influenced by  Pythagoreanism.  Significantly, Bergson’s argument for partial finalism replicates  Plotinus and relies on key Pythagorean concepts: an original undifferentiated unity, the  division and association  of opposites, the notion of microcosm and macrocosm being a  sympathetic whole, the notion of war generating new forms and the destruction of  others as a result of harmonic interference, and the fact that musical ratios or  proportions can account for the development of identical structures in independent lines  of evolution.  It was acknowledged that while commentators have noted the harmonics  model, mystery surrounding Bergson’s cosmology means they have not made the  connection in any depth.  It is proposed that his arguments for a musical theme  are  consistent with, ultimately depend on, and therefore support the harmonic model  proposed in Chapter 5.  It was contended that Bergson’s arguments for a difference between quantitative  and qualitative multiplicity replicates Plotinus’ distinction between monadic and  substantial number and he acknowledges he is following Plotinus’s theory of logos.  </p><div id="pagenum"><p>217</p></div><p id="page">209   Despite having a clear understanding that Plotinus’ logos refers to substantial number  and form, it was considered noteworthy that he failed to explain it as such in his lectures  and talks.  It was argued that commentators’ perceptions of the influence of mathematics on  Bergson should be re-evaluated in the light of the Pythagorean influence on him.  The  spatial conceptual mathematics of Riemann is not consistent with the temporal nature of  duration, and it was suggested the calculus Bergson had in mind for his philosophical  method was able to operate genuinely qualitative differentiations and integrations as the  Pythagoreans conceived it.  Hence the mathematics underpinning it was not the  mathematics of science, but music, the significance of which is that it takes account of  the intervals.   The examination of his ‘Lectures on the Pythagoreans’ assessed his attitude  towards them, and it was ascertained he was familiar with their cosmology, and he  adopted key concepts in his work.  It revealed sympathy with their theory of number  and philosophy of transformation.  It was argued that the combination of harmonics and Pythagorean concepts in his  work suggests his concept of duration as melody cannot be interpreted as mere  metaphor.  While Bergson insisted on precision in philosophy, the harmonic principles  forming the basis of melody are precisely those forming the basis of the élan vital  and  duration.  It was also suggested that his spatial metaphors are intended to form part of  the process of ‘unveiling’ or initiation for the reader.  The argument for a Pythagorean influence on Bergson will be developed further  in Chapter 9  with an examination of how the Pythagorean concept of kairos impacts on  his work.  The next chapter will introduce the concept of kairos with an explanation of  how it was understood in ancient Greece.  </p><div id="pagenum"><p>218</p></div><p id="page">210   Chapter 7    Kairos (Kαιρός)    *      Introduction        Kairos is a term used in ancient Greece to refer to the moment of ‘happening’, or the  incomplete moment that bridges or intersects the past and the future and is therefore  essentially temporal in nature.  In the modern literature, the concept of kairos is  prevalent in the studies of rhetoric, theology and to a lesser extent, politics. Theology  has placed increasing emphasis on it due to the work of Paul Tillich who was hugely  influenced by Schelling; however, a survey of the literature reveals it to be a subject  largely neglected by scholars of Plotinus and Bergson, particularly in the English  language literature.  French language sources provide only a scattering of articles that  indicate its relevance to Bergson, notably from Vladimir Jankélévitch whose own  philosophy is highly influenced by kairos, and J.M. Gebaude who has written  specifically on the strong influence on Bergson, while E. Moutsopoulos, a philosopher  of kairicity, has written extensively on the general subject of kairos, including its  relevance to the philosophy of Plotinus.  Kairos is an important concept that links  Bergson and Plotinus to ancient Greece and the Pythagorean tradition, thus  strengthening the argument for a Pythagorean influence on them.  As it plays an  important role in the cosmology and psychology of Plotinus and Bergson, this brief  Chapter is a prelude to explaining the nature of kairos in their work.  It introduces the  subject of time in the form of Chronos and Kairos as it was understood in ancient  Greece, by the Pythagoreans, and how their influence pervades classical rhetoric, the </p><div id="pagenum"><p>219</p></div><p id="page">211   importance of which will be addressed in Chapter 9 in an examination of how Bergson  incorporates the principles of rhetoric into his philosophy.            7.1   Chronos and Kairos in Ancient Greece            For the ancient Greeks, Chronos was the primeval god of time, who in Orphic  cosmogonies emerged self-formed at the beginning of creation.  With his consort  Ananke (necessity), he circled the primal world-egg and split it apart to form the  ordered universe of earth, sea and sky.  As they subsequently continued to circle the  cosmos, their passage powered the circling of heaven and the eternal passage of time.   While the ancient Greeks measured the time of day by shadows, months by the phases  of the moon, and seasons by animal migration and astrological movement, they  considered the natural world to be anything but stable or trustworthy, as Allen  comments:     …a closer look at the evidence suggests that Hesiod, like a number of other  early Greek writers, had a far subtler sense of how deeply irregular and  unreliable the passage of time in nature really is. (Allen, 2003, p. 63)    The Greek oral poet Hesiod (circa. 750-650 B.C.) provides a clear insight into the  ancient Greek perception of time in ‘Works and Days’, in which he guides the reader  on natural signs including animal and plant behaviour, weather, seasons and astronomy  that indicate conditions for action.  Time here is referred to as “time to” or “time of” </p><div id="pagenum"><p>220</p></div><p id="page">212   (τότε - II. 452), “season” (ὡραῖος - II. 663-677), “right time” (ὡραῖος - II. 663-677),  “when” (ὅτ᾽- II. 111), (ὁπότε - II. 494).136   Time did not assume any regularity until the fourth century B.C. when sun dials  were used to indicate the time of day, and water clocks (clepsydrai) were used like  stop-watches in the courts to time speeches and for imposing a time limit on a client’s  visit in Athenian brothels (Landels, 1979, p.33).  Time was fashioned by human  decisions, and since life accommodated changing circumstances and focused on  agricultural need, religious festivals as well as political and military activities were  scheduled according to the demand for agricultural labour (Foxhall, 1995, pp.97-110);  hence, even solar or lunar calendars varied between different regions, and civil  calendars were regularly adjusted by the archons (chief magistrates) as they saw fit.     Since the application of measured time was very limited, in everyday life it was not  generally considered to be directly measurable, uniform, or absolutely predictable; as  such, it was purely subjective and greater emphasis was placed on the notion of time as  kairos.  In Greek mythology, Kairos was the youngest son of Zeus, considered to be the  daimon (spirit) of opportunity.  He is depicted as a young man with wings on his feet,  indicating the speed at which he passes, balancing on the tips of his toes on a sphere,  representing the fact that he is running.  He holds scales balanced on a razor signifying  that justice or a decision is required at the point of kairos that stands between the past  and the future.  The tuft of hair on his forehead represents the opportune moment that  can be grasped as he approaches, while the back of his head is bald indicating a lost  opportunity for action.  Such depictions may also be read as literal ek-stases from the                                                                136  See p.213 where it is explained that in Hesiod time as kairos is associated with: “the proper  amount in the given circumstances” and in speech it refers to the use of language that is      “appropriate, straightforward, and correct”.  </p><div id="pagenum"><p>221</p></div><p id="page">213   world, as a function of that world.  Aesop's Fables, written between 620 and 560 B.C.,  describe Kairos in Fable 536.  Pollitt refers to a bronze statue of Kairos in the entrance  to the stadium in which the first Olympiad was held in 776 BC, and Pausanius refers to  a statue of Kairos sculpted by Lysippos from Sikyon, which was complemented by an  epigram by Poseidippos describing the character of Kairos (Pollitt, 1986, pp.53-54).137   According to the Online Liddell-Scott-Jones Lexicon, kairos (καιρός) acquired  many different meanings ranging initially from the spatial and later to the temporal,  including: due measure, proportion, fitness, a vital part of the body, exact or critical  time, season, opportunity, advantage or profit (Liddell-Scott-Jones, 2017).  Kairos, as  subjective qualitative time, centred on the demands of action necessary for agriculture  and required a flexible response to natural signs and conditions.  In a study of kairos in Greek drama, Race advises that the adjectival form of the  word first appears around 800 B.C. in Homer’s Iliad (4.185, 8.84, 326) in which it  refers to a vital place in the body.  As a ‘normative word’, it often had no specific  temporal meaning.  In Hesiod, it refers to “ the proper amount  in the given  circumstances” and in speech it refers to the use of language that is “appropriate,  straightforward, and correct” (II. 694).  While these concepts can be associated with  time in Works and Days  in terms of “time to”, “time of, etc. as explained above, Race  proposes that the temporal aspect is developed by the Greek lyric poet Theognis of  Megara (600 BC), and later by the comic playwright Aristophanes (446-386 B.C.) for  whom the meaning of kairos becomes ‘success’ resulting ‘from action which is                                                                137   In Gibbs translation of Fable 563 he also notes that “This fable is based on a famous statue  of Kairos, 'Opportunity,' by Lysippus, a famous Greek sculptor of the fourth century B.C.E  (the statue is described in Posidippus, Anthologia Planudea 275 and Ausonius, Epigrams  11).”    See also Phaedrus Book 5.8, p.367, in Babrius & Phaedrus , 1989.    </p><div id="pagenum"><p>222</p></div><p id="page">214   appropriate to or needed in the particular circumstances’.  Race however, finds  references to kairos as ‘success’ in Sophocles and ‘advantage’ in Euripides.  Kairos as  ‘opportunity’ or ‘chance’ is proposed by Euripides ( Ion 1062) in the fourth century B.C.   Race concludes:    the temporal sense often enters the question because we naturally think of  "times," "occasions," and "moments," when we are dealing with given  circumstances or situations that change in time, and it is a short step from  "appropriate to the given situation" to "correct at the moment" to "timely”.  (Race, 1981, pp.197-213)138    While kairos is also sometimes translated as ‘profit’, Wilson’s study of the citations in  the lexica to the end of the fourth century B.C. suggests very limited relevance (Wilson,  1981, pp.418-420).      As an indicator for action, kairos was also important in moral life and provided a  sense of control over the instability of time.  It was therefore an influential concept in  ancient Greece, covering the realms of medicine, literature, poetry, performing art,  rhetoric as well as the philosophy of the pre-Socratics, and subsequently the aesthetics  and ethics of Plato and Aristotle (Sipiora, 2002, p.3).  All these different fields  acknowledged that the concept of proportion  is fundamental to Kairos.  Eskin argues that kairos is a core theme in the medical writings attributed to  Hippocrates (460-375 B.C.), where there is an emphasis on giving practical advice to  the physician on using experience, judgement and instinct when treating patients.   Successfu l treatment was based around the concepts of observation and enquiry; the  physician had to take all relevant environmental factors into account, including the  symptoms presented, astronomical factors, season, weather conditions, the patient's                                                                138  For an extensive commentary of kairos in Classical Greek literature, see: Levi, 1923.  </p><div id="pagenum"><p>223</p></div><p id="page">215   emotional state, what is said or done by the patient and physician etc.  Kairos means  providing the right treatment at the most opportune time and in the right proportion.   Eskin notes:    Hippocrates' literal use of the word kairos is frequent and telling: among the  fifty-six works included in IBYCUS, kairos appears in thirty- three; within those  thirty-three works, some form of the root kair- appears 264 times. (Eskin, 2002,  p.98)        7.2    Kairos in the Pythagorean Tradition        As noted in Chapter 5, the Pythagorean study of numbers was applied in both a spatial  and temporal context, where geometry was considered as number in space, and music  or harmonics as number in time.  Unlike Kant who proposed that time and space are a  priori and necessary for experience, the Pythagoreans considered time to be generated  with the cosmogonic and cosmologic process; Archytas wrote: “Time is the interval of  the nature of all” (Simplicius, Aristotelis categorias Commentarii , in Ariotti, 1975,  p.72).  A compendium of essays in Rhetoric and Kairos; Essays in History, Theory, and  Praxis edited by Philip Sipiora and James S. Baumlin, is a key source of information  regarding the philosophical roots of kairos.  Sipiora acknowledges the importance of  the examinations of pre-Socratic thought by the Italian scholars Augusto Rostagni,  Doro Levi, and Mario Untersteiner, and significantly all relevant contributions refer  almost exclusively to these sources. Rostagni examined the role of kairos in sophistic  rhetoric, particularly Pythagorean influences on Gorgias and Antisthenes (Rostagni,  1922).  Doro Levi examined kairos in Greek literature and in the Seven Sages,  Thucydides, Democritis, and Pythagoras, and this influence on Plato, who uses kairos  to link ethics and aesthetics which subsequently shapes his thinking on philosophical </p><div id="pagenum"><p>224</p></div><p id="page">216   rhetoric (Levi, 1923; Levi, 1924) .  Mario Untersteiner produced a detailed analysis of  the influence of kairos on Sophistic thought with an emphasis on Gorgias  (Untersteiner, 1954).  The philosophical source of kairos is generally accepted by scholars to be  Pythagorean , for whom it had cosmological and ethical significance.  The potentially  free decisive act of the individual required the necessary kairos of the outer world for  its application, as Smith comments:    The important point … is that the time of kairos is seen as an ontological  element in the basic structure of things and, while that time calls for a human  response, the occasion itself is not of human devising. (Smith, 2002, pp.53-54)     The significance of kairos as a dynamic and generative temporal concept in  Pythagorean cosmology arises from the importance they attributed the number 7; its  power appears to be one of transition from the old to the new, the past to the future,  and the Pythagoreans acknowledged it in the outer world as well as the inner.   Alexander of Aphrodisias refers to the Pythagorean notion of kairos as ‘opportunity’:    The number 7 is opportunity ( kairos), for natural things seem to have their  seasons of completion, both of birth and of maturity, according to [periods of]  seven, as in the case of man. For a man is born seven months [after conception],  and cuts his teeth after the same number of months, and reaches puberty at  about the end of the second period of seven years, and grows a beard at about  the end of the third.  The sun too, since it is itself thought to be the cause of the  seasons, they say it is situated [in the place] where the number 7 is, which they  call ‘due season’ ( kairos); for they say that the sun occupies the seventh place  [from the periphery] among the ten bodies that move around the centre, or  hearth. (Alexander of Aphrodisias, Metaphysics  I, 38, 17-38, in Dooley, 1989).     In this context, the number 7 arises cyclically, but always as part of the natural  evolutionary process involving real change that may be necessary or even providential.  </p><div id="pagenum"><p>225</p></div><p id="page">217   The number 7 is also important in the science of harmonics; it is the last note before the  start of a new octave and carries with it the potential for the most concordant harmony.  Untersteiner comments that the Pythagoreans considered kairos to be "one of  the fundamental laws of the universe" because kairos was implicit in the generative  process of the universe through harmonia , the integration of opposites (Untersteiner,  1954, pp.110-111).  The link to harmonics also had important implications for  Pythagorean ethics; in ‘Kairos in Classical and Modern Rhetorical Theory’, James L.  Kinneavy refers to Rostagni:    One of the most significant ethical components of kairos had to do with its  close relation to justice, particularly among the Pythagoreans.  Justice was  defined as giving to each according to merit … Justice, therefore was  determined by circumstances: justice was kairos (Rostagni, 163).  This  combination was omnipresent in Pythagoras; according to Rostagni, “All of his  [Pythagoras’s] teachings, his influence as founder of a school and as expert and  custodian of minds – everything is based on the combined principles of kairos  and dikaion [justice]” (168). (Kinneavy, 2002, p.61)    Kinneavy also discusses the civic educational dimension of kairos, referring to the  Pythagorean influence:    we know that Pythagoras had oriented his training in education to civic  education, to training for public affairs, for life in the polis (Rostagni, 188).   Iamblichus in his Life of Pythagoras  states, “They say that he would have been  the inventor of all civic education [ politike paideia ]” (Rostagni, 71).  The  constant theme of all his speeches was virtue, with kairos the determining  principle in each case. (Kinneavy, 2002, p.65)    Proportion was an important subject of enquiry for Archytas, whose concern for  fairness and stability in political and moral life approached it with mathematical  precision, giving arithmetic or calculation ( logismos) priority over the other sciences.  </p><div id="pagenum"><p>226</p></div><p id="page">218   Like Philolaus he argued that through number, we can make discoveries about the  world around us and understand it, as well as living a good life through its practical  application (DK 47 B3).  Archytas formulated a proof that the musical intervals in the  form of (n+1): n cannot be divided in half, i.e., that there are no mean proportional  numbers in the superparticular ratios that govern the musical scale, 2:1, 4:3, 3:2 and 9:8  (Huffman, 2005, p.62).  For Archytas, while all the ‘means’, arithmetic, geometric and  harmonic have their rightful application, proportion is a relative value, which does not  imply that the equality implicit in the arithmetic mean will always be appropriate.  A  similar theory was adopted by Aristotle ( Nicomachean Ethics , Book II), whose virtue  ethics were developed by education, but which excluded the mathematical precision  considered necessary by later Pythagoreans; however, for both the Pythagoreans and  Aristotle a ‘sense’ of proportion was fundamental for living a good life ( Nicomachean  Ethics, Book V).   While Eskin, as noted above, remarks on the influence of kairos in the medical  writings attributed to Hippocrates, Iamblichus, in his ‘Life of Pythagoras’ wrote:    And there are certain melodies devised as remedies against the passions of the  soul, and also against despondency and lamentation, which Pythagoras invented  as things that afford the greatest assistance in these maladies. And again, he  employed other melodies against rage and anger, and against every aberration  of the soul. There is also another kind of modulation invented as a remedy  against desires.  (Taylor, 1986, pp.59-60)    While Iamblichus does not mention kairos explicitly, he describes how Pythagoras  corrected these imbalances by prescribing melodies or sounds according to “the rule of  virtue” which is understood to be appropriate action taken at the right time and in the  right proportion.  Pythagoras helped to induce restful sleep and cleared heaviness in the  morning through “certain peculiar songs and modulations, produced either by simply </p><div id="pagenum"><p>227</p></div><p id="page">219   striking the lyre, or employing the voice” (Taylor, 1986, pp.32).  His description  therefore contains all the essential features of kairos.   The Pythagorean notion of kairos was taught and employed in Greek rhetoric as  important for phronesis (practical wisdom), for speaking intelligently in the assembly,  the courts and in private discourse, to enable citizens to decide on the best course of  action in specific circumstances.  It required an intense awareness of occasion,  audience, and the situational context.  Sipiora notes how kairos dominated classical  Greek rhetoric:    Kairos plays a major role in the First Sophistic movement, especially in the  works of Protagoras and Gorgias.  The legacy of kairos continues in Aristotle’s  taxonomy of rhetorical principles …; it also assumes major importance in  Plato’s concept of philosophical rhetoric and in Isocrates’ rhetorical paideia.  In  short, kairos was the cornerstone of rhetoric in the Golden Age of Greece.  (Sipiora, 2002, p.3)    Kairos remained the foundational principle for Gorgias’ reputed student, Isocrates who  considered it a way of life and developed a complete educational system around it.  He  was a rival of Plato and his views on rhetorical theory influenced Aristotle.   According to the Italian scholars, the Pythagorean influence has  been traced  within the field of classical Greek sophistic rhetoric from Isocrates, back through  Gorgias and on to Empedocles who provides the direct link to Pythagoreanism.  Carter  comments: “It was through Empedocles that kairos as the principle of opposites and  harmony came to influence sophistic epistemology”.  Empedocles, who appears to have  been influenced by Pythagoreanism, provided a relativistic epistemology based upon  opposing concepts and upon which his student, Gorgias, built rhetoric on the basis of  “conflict and resolution”.  Carter refers to Enos who states that Gorgias' rhetorical  methodology was “based upon a system of investigation in which probable knowledge </p><div id="pagenum"><p>228</p></div><p id="page">220   or opinion was revealed as a synthesis from dichotomous antithetical positions” (Enos,  1976, p.50); however, Carter also notes that a decision could also be arrived at by  choosing “one position over its opposite based on the sense of greatest probability.”  (Carter, 1988, pp.102-106).  According to Sipiora, kairos employed in rhetoric was "a  dynamic principle rather than a static, codified rhetorical technique" (Sipiora, 2002,  p.10); the idea was to overcome the possibility of inaction caused by the cycle of  contradictory positions, both of which could be conceived as true.  Unlike the later  Pythagoreans, the method employed by Gorgias was deemed irrational, and even  though commentators who support the view that Gorgias uses the Pythagorean notion  of harmonia  between opposites, are in the majority, the verdict is not unanimous; De  Vogel disputes the link with Gorgias:    For Pythagoras kairos is rooted in a cosmic-ontological order, whereas for  Gorgias this background is completely absent.  This makes for a radical  difference; for it implies that for Pythagoras kairos had its place within a τάξις  [order; system] and as such is of a rational -ethical character, whereas for  Gorgias, where there is no such foundation, a complete irrationality remains.  (De Vogel, 1966, p.118)    One could certainly argue that there is no evidence to support the view that kairos was  completely rational for the Pythagoreans because there are no Pythagorean texts that  specifically address the concept of kairos, in general or its association with rhetoric.  We  have to keep in mind that in the early Pythagorean era this is how time was generally  conceived.  It called for action based on judgements made on the basis of instinct or  intuition and it appears to have been developed by later Pythagoreans such as Archytas  who endeavoured to provide a rational answer to questions of ethics.     </p><div id="pagenum"><p>229</p></div><p id="page">221   7.3   An Introduction to Kairos in Plotinus and Bergson        The concept of kairos has also been acknowledged to be at work in the philosophy of  Plotinus and Bergson for whom the ontological aspect arises from  a dynamic and  ordered process of contemplation or intuition in which the universe and life within it  are generated and evolve as harmonics and vibrations or overtones, as proposed in  Chapters 4 and 5.  However, it will be argued that for Plotinus and Bergson the  psychological and ethical significance of kairos is considered an act of determined  indeterminacy, bridging the tension between providence and freedom (Plotinus) and  determinism and freedom (Bergson).  This is possible because we have been provided  with the basic structure or order that we use for our own evolution in which we create  at will.  Kairos in the human domain, which has practical utility, is a moment of action  or ‘timing’, an occasion signifying the emergence of qualitative change that is situation  specific.  It is essentially open, undetermined and opportune; the crucial, decisive,  though incomplete, interval that links the past to the future and one that requires human  participation in the act of creation.  It is a poietic moment in which Plotinus and  Bergson employ the Pythagorean notions of opposites and harmonia  in their concepts  of mind and matter, and freedom and determinacy, concepts that integrate to facilitate  action.  Chapter 8 will present an interpretation of how Plotinus achieves this by  examining his concepts of sense perception, memory, reason and contemplation, and  how they impact on ethical action, while Chapter 9 will examine the operation of kairos  in Bergson’s concepts of perception and memory, and their relationship with intellect  and intuition, and how it functions in ethical action.      </p><div id="pagenum"><p>230</p></div><p id="page">222   Chapter 8    Plotinus and Kairos    *      Introduction        Plotinus discusses the concept of time in the context of chronos in Ennead III. 7, ‘On  Eternity and Time’,139 where he claims eternity is the life of Intellect and its intelligible  substance; its eternal existence or non-temporal nature means it has no past and no  future (Ennead III.7.5, 27).  Time or temporal becoming is “the life of soul in a  movement of passage from one way of life to another” ( Ennead III.7.11, 44-45), and  the moving image of eternity ( Ennead III.7.13, 24-25), a concept taken from Plato  (Timaeus, 38 b6-c2; 37 d7-e4).  Time is not measured time as we think of it; it is kairos  as the Soul moves between Intellect and the material world, and in Ennead IV.7.9,  Plotinus claims time is indefinite, non-spatial, and as such is neither a magnitude that  can be measured or numbered, nor is it a measure or a number itself;140 it is a  continuous unbounded succession ( Ennead III.7.11, 55-56).  As such it is a precursor to  Bergson’s account of duration originally espoused in Time and Free Will  because  Plotinus argues that time is not a quantitative multiplicity that is measured as discrete  units in space.                                                                139  It is not my intention to provide a comprehensive critique of this treatise, thus replicating  the work of others.  See, for example: (Wagner, 2008); (Smith, 1996); (Clark, 1944).  I  merely take what is relevant to understanding the concept of Kairos in the Enneads.     140  See also Ennead VI.1.5, 16–20.     </p><div id="pagenum"><p>231</p></div><p id="page">223   At the level of the Hypostasis Soul , all Souls are considered a unity; however,  they have different functions or faculties operative in the process.  The World Soul   generates the world and there is a Soul that unifies the individual souls and their powers  within it.  Because kairos applies to the World Soul  as well as individual human souls, it  is pertinent to clarify how it operates with their respective functions: the making of the  material world, the action of the individual soul within its corporeal environment, and  how Plotinus incorporates freedom within his concept of Providence.  It is therefore  necessary to consider how Plotinus’ cosmology relates to his psychology, a subject that  has caused difficulties for most commentators because both are founded on the concept  of logos, which, as was argued in Chapter 3, has been unsatisfactorily interpreted.141  The Chapter begins with an explanation of the nature of kairos as it applies to the  World Soul  and nature, and then it examines the key concepts of sense perception,  memory, reason, and freedom as they relate to the individual soul.  A comprehensive  critical analysis of these concepts is not possible here, so the intention is to present the  salient features, note the perceived difficulties, and draw upon textual evidence to  support the argument that they can be resolved, if the theory that Plotinus founds his  philosophy on Pythagorean harmonics is applied to these concepts.          8.1   Kairos and the World Soul         Moutsopoulos refers to kairos in nature as “the infinitesimal moment that causes the  transition (and conversion) of a given phase of natural evolution to the next”  (Moutsopoulos, 1984, p.443), and the function of the World Soul  and nature, its lowest                                                                141  Chapter 3.4, pp.82-89. </p><div id="pagenum"><p>232</p></div><p id="page">224   aspect, is to make the beings of the world as a temporal unfolding of logos in matter as  a process of contemplation.  It achieves this according to Providence, that is, it does not  make by deliberate choice or reasoning, but by necessity.142  How then does Plotinus  consider the making of the world an act of freedom?  Plotinus refers to freedom as ‘ἐφ’  ἡμῖν’, often translated as ‘that which is in our power’, ‘that which is in our control’, or  ‘that which depends on us’.  In Ennead VI.8, Plotinus explains how ‘ἐφ’ ἡμῖν’ applies  to the One and Intellect, which helps us to understand its application to the World Soul .   There are three key requirements for freedom: (1) self-sufficiency; (2) what it makes  must be within its power; and (3) its knowledge is right knowledge or wisdom.  Self- sufficiency means there is no affection arising from outside influences.  The One is  self-sufficient in that it is cause of everything else and Intellect’s freedom arises from  its self-determination, its thinking, or self-contemplation.  He proposes:    …we shall grant voluntary action to one whose doings depend on the activities  of Intellect and who is free from bodily affections.  We trace what is in our  power to the noblest principle, the activity of Intellect, and shall grant that the  premises of action derived from this are truly free. (VI.8.3, 19-23)                Plotinus proposes that “all things come from contemplation and are contemplation,  both the things that truly exist and the things which come from them” (III.8.7, 1-2).   Furthermore,    That which is called the Soul of the All …considers what lies below it  contemplatively and remains attached to the realities before it for ever; both are  certainly possible; it can receive from There and at the same time distribute  here, since it was impracticable for it as soul not to be in contact with this  world. (IV.8.7, 26-32)                                                                  142  Chapter 4.2, p.106.  </p><div id="pagenum"><p>233</p></div><p id="page">225   Deck’s analysis of this statement is helpful, suggesting the consideration of what lies  below the World Soul  implies that it cannot be “caused or conditioned” by it, hence  ruling out knowledge arising from sensation which is posterior to it, and discursive  reasoning which is dependent upon sensation.  He adds, “The consideration here must  rather be the World Soul’s  eternal wisdom”; that in contemplating Intellect, the World  Soul knows the world as the imitation of Intellect, “an imitation which is its function to  produce”.  Deck also proposes that reference to ‘same time’ here is not meant  temporally but indicates the internal duality of the World Soul  (Deck, 1991, p.64).    Plotinus states in Ennead III.8.5, 20, “action cannot come before contemplation”, so  kairos, as the moment of happening, is paradoxical because while the world is  providentially and necessarily ordered, it is achieved by the contemplation of Intellect  in its desire for the Good, and while its lower aspect, nature, makes the world, it does  so by contemplating itself, and is self-disposed in this respect.  In summary then, the  World Soul  fulfils the requirements for freedom, or ἐφ’ ἡμῖν, because it is not under  outside influence, what it makes is within its power, and its knowledge is right  knowledge or wisdom because it directly contemplates the forms in Intellect that are  Beings of eternal truth.    The generation of the world by the World Soul  as kairos therefore includes the bi- directional movement found in Intellect, procession and reversion; however, while this  movement may be considered horizontal because the highest aspect of the World Soul   remains in Intellect, it distributes the forms to its lower aspect, nature, vertically and  temporally.  Movement from the higher to the lower is necessarily determined, whereas  the ascension to Intellect fulfils the requirements of ἐφ’ ἡμῖν.  The World Soul  has no  need of a temporal memory because its being and its knowledge are complete due to its  contemplation of Intellect, an activity that Plotinus describes as “recollection” of what </p><div id="pagenum"><p>234</p></div><p id="page">226   is already present in the Platonic sense.  Recollection is also an activity of individual  human souls, who, as we will see, also possess the powers of sense perception,  temporal memory and reasoning, as well as the ability to achieve ἐφ’ ἡμῖν.         8.2   Kairos and the Individual Soul        Specific reference to kairos arises eight times in the Enneads,143 always in the context  of ‘occasion’ and with reference to Soul.  In Ennead III.5.8, Plotinus refers to Zeus as   Intellect, with Soul being his offspring, who was Kairos  in Greek mythology,144 and  while this may not have been his intention here, it is in Ennead IV.4 that Plotinus  comes closest to describing the life of the individual soul in terms that replicate the  ancient meaning of kairos as described in the previous chapter:    There is one thing after another related to our needs and the present  moment, not definite in itself but always related to one external thing  after another: as a result our decisions are different and relevant to the  occasion when the need arises, and now this and now that external  incident occurs. (IV.4.17, 5-9)    In this quotation Plotinus refers specifically to occasion as ‘καιρός’. The present  moment is indefinite  or constantly changing, hence man needs sense perception to be  consciously aware of what is externally present, memory to provide temporal  continuity between those perceptions, and reason to help us understand what we                                                                143  Enneads: I.4.16, 19; I.8.8, 35; II.3.1, 10; II.3.3, 22; II.9.13, 24; IV.4.17, 7; VI.8.18, 44 and        VI.8.18, 47.    144  Armstrong comments: In ch.2 of this treatise, and elsewhere, Kronos is Intellect. This        passage shows … how little importance Plotinus attaches to the interpretation of myths.        (p.197)   </p><div id="pagenum"><p>235</p></div><p id="page">227   perceive and make decisions about how to respond to the occasion with appropriate  goal directed action.  The ability to decide also suggests an element of freedom is  involved in the process.   When considering the notion of kairos in the context of individual human souls,  things become more complicated because the individual has a body possessing a trace  of soul made by nature, the lowest level of the World Soul , as well as possessing a  higher incorporeal soul operating independently of the body and remaining distinct  from it.  The lower aspect of soul functions with the body, considered an instrument for  practical activity ( Ennead IV.3.26, 2-8), and its higher aspect is purely intellectual  since it possesses its own intellect as well as having access to Intellect that is common  to all souls.  Blumenthal comments that Plotinus never gives a comprehensive account  of all the faculties operative within the material body and individual soul, and our  understanding is blurred because “we find both Platonic and Peripatetic doctrines,  apparently left in more or less haphazard juxtaposition”.  We have the tripartite division  of the soul from Plato mixed with an Aristotelian division of faculties (Blumenthal,  1971, p.21).  While Plotinus tends to refer to faculties as ‘souls’, it is more helpful to  think of them as different powers operative within the composite living being.   Blumenthal has summarised the faculties in a helpful diagram (Blumenthal, 1971,  p.44), placing the various faculties within each of its aspects, though this is by no  means clear.  The material body appears to possess a vegetative soul, which is  responsible for growth, nutrition, reproduction, and maintainence of the body ( Ennead  III.6.4, 32; IV.3.23, 35), a sensitive soul, and an appetitive soul that is the seat of  natural desires, pleasures and pains  (Ennead VI.4.15, 8-17).  The cognitive faculties  including imagination, memory, opinion, discursive reason and intellection appear to be  mainly operative within the higher soul that functions with the lower sensitive soul to </p><div id="pagenum"><p>236</p></div><p id="page">228   provide information.  Plotinus seems to suggest all the faculties are present to all living  beings, however they are not all operative to the same degree, for example, the  vegetative soul will be dominant in plants, while the cognitive faculties may be unused,  and even in human beings one or more faculties may dominate others, the effect being  either positive or negative in terms of practical action or well-being.  The examination of kairos in human practical action will primarily focus on  sense perception, and the faculties of memory and reason, powers providing the  individual with conscious temporal apprehension of its environment and thoughts,  which is essential for deciding appropriate action.         8.2.1   Sense Perception        For Plotinus, sensation occurs in the body as a separate function to perception, which is  a faculty of the individual, lower, or irrational soul forming a composite with the body.   These two functions must therefore be distinctly examined before uniting them as sense  perception.    In Ennead IV.5, Plotinus discusses the affection of the sense organs, with the  primary focus being the relationship between the eye and the object of vision, while  proposing his theory of sensation also applies to the other senses ( Ennead IV.6.1, 11- 14).  He suggests a sensory organ is affected or receives an impression (τύπος) and  becomes assimilated to the object ( Ennead IV.4.23), while specifically rejecting  materialistic theories of material impressions, such as an impression of an object in wax  (Ennead IV.6.1, 1-2), or of a medium such as air being involved; instead, he claims  sensation is achieved by sympathia.   If it is in the nature of a given thing to be  sympathetically affected by another thing because it has some resemblance to it, the </p><div id="pagenum"><p>237</p></div><p id="page">229   medium is not affected, or at least not in the same way ( Ennead IV.5.1, 35-38).  The  concepts of ‘impressions’, ‘assimilation’ and ‘resemblance’ are implicit in sympathia , a  subject causing difficulty for those analysing Plotinus’ theory of sense perception.   Emilsson, for example, examined the subject in depth and is referenced by other  commentators.  He admits that he cannot account for the link between similarity and  sympathia , and while he comments that Plotinus discusses sympathia  as action at a  distance to explain the efficacy of magic, prayer, the influence of the celestial bodies,  as well as visual and auditory transmission, he remains in the dark:    …beyond what has been said, Plotinus says nothing about the mechanism by  which sympathia is supposed to work.  At any rate I have not been able to gain  many insights relevant to the issue of visual transmission from what Plotinus  says about sympathia  outside IV.5. (Emilsson, 1988, p.48)    No other commentator appears to have offered an adequate explanation either.   Emilsson correctly refers to Ennead IV.4.23 where Plotinus refers to the body as being  assimilated to its object, where assimilate means “to make alike”, and he also notes that  the organ passively receives the form from its object; however he proceeds to argue  that the sense organ receives the quality of the form; that the affection is a “literal  assimilation”, suggesting that “something in the eye is supposed to become literally red  when a red thing is seen”.  On pages 82-86 he explains this as the eye taking on colours  in a phenomenal sense; for example, vision undergoes experiences of the colours in  things that are before its eyes, and this does not require knowing that red is red.  It is a  pure experience of sensation that is outside of consciousness (Emilsson, 1988, p.87).   He therefore proposes that objects have an independent existence as qualities, a view  also shared by Chiaradonna (Chiaradonna, 2012, pp.194-198).  Emilsson’s and  Chiaradonna’s literal interpretation would be flawed according to how Plotinus </p><div id="pagenum"><p>238</p></div><p id="page">230   conceives sympathia  from the perspective of the model of harmonics explained in  Chapter 4.  In this model the universe consists of logoi or forms that are vibrations and  substantial numbers, and sympathia  creates change or novelty through a process of  constructive and destructive interference; however, another of its features is the passive  affection of an object by another object at a distance from it, but one which leaves the  passive recipient unchanged.  It is referred to in modern physics as ‘sympathetic  resonance’, a term defined by Green and Butler as follows:    Sympathetic vibration is a special type of resonance in which sound waves,  traveling in air, transmit energy from one sonorous vibrator to another.  The  second vibrator must possess the same natural frequency …, or have a  frequency that is an integral multiple of that natural frequency. (Green & Butler,  2006, p.248)    Similarly, Plotinus refers to the strings of separated lyres having a ‘sense’ of  attunement with each other, and because of its importance to the current subject I repeat  the passage quoted in Chapter 4:145    But often too, when one string is plucked another has a kind of sense of this by  its concord and the fact that it is tuned to the same scale.  But if the vibration  can even pass from one lyre to another in so far as a sympathy exists, then there  is also one single harmony in the All. ( Ennead IV.4.41, 4-8)    While Emilsson does not acknowledge this passage, Plotinus is obviously aware that  sympathetic resonance is a natural phenomenon because he uses it as an example of  sympathia in which there is action at a distance.  Such a resonance will not affect  surrounding objects in the same way unless they are also attuned to it.  It is therefore  suggested that when Plotinus refers to a sensory organ receiving impressions, he means                                                                145  Chapter 4.3, p.115.   </p><div id="pagenum"><p>239</p></div><p id="page">231   that one form resonates to the vibrations of another, which also makes sense of his  assertion that apprehension of the object of vision occurs where the object is ( Ennead  IV.6.1, 16-17).  It must be noted that this also Bergson’s understanding of sympathia in  Plotinus.146  An understanding of  ‘resemblance’ or ‘similarity’ can be found in Ennead  I.2., where Plotinus refers to “likeness” in two senses:     one requires that there should be something the same in things which are alike;  this applies to things which derive their likeness equally from the same  principle. ( Ennead I.2.2, 5-7)    The “likeness” between sense objects and sense organs arises because they are bodies  that originate from the same principle, the World Soul  or nature, and possess the same  natural frequency , and also the same substantial number or harmonic  linked to that  frequency.  The other kind of  ‘likeness’ will be discussed later. ‘Assimilation’ refers to  the fact that the receiving form is caused to vibrate at that frequency, in sympathetic  resonance with it, just as sympathetic resonance occurs between the two strings.  While  physics acknowledges that sound vibrations need air as a medium, for Plotinus’ non- material theory, a medium such as air is not necessary because the universe is a living  being whose parts are integral to it, just as a hand is an integral part of the body while  being distinct from the other parts.  It is, as Emilsson notes, like that of light which is  able to pass through a vacuum, making air unnecessary for visual sensation (Emilsson,  1988, p.41).  The sense organs have their own forms or vibrations that resonate with  what they sense, for example, the eye resonates to the vibration of light and the ear  resonates to the vibration of sound; the eye does not see sounds because it is not  attuned to the same scale.                                                                 146  See: Appendix 4, p.48.  Here Bergson states: “But for Plotinus perception is sympathy of  the organ with the object with which it vibrates in unison”. </p><div id="pagenum"><p>240</p></div><p id="page">232   This new interpretation suggests that as products of nature, bodies are forms in  matter only as contemplations, or imitations; not qualitative images of the forms in  Intellect as Emilsson proposes.   Emilsson interprets εἴδωλον as “image or reflection in  the sense in which an ontologically posterior item is said to be an image of an  ontologically prior one”, and he states that it is used “synonymously with … mimêma”  or imitation (Emilsson, 1988, p.119).  There is a possible confusion in the secondary  literature caused by Plotinus’ use of the word mimêma.  While Emilsson tends to  interpret this as a qualitative image, it raises the question of where these images come  from.  Nature does not imagine, it only contemplates the forms in itself, and matter  reflects the forms as an imitation of those in Intellect, which are certainly not images,  because matter is nothing and has no power ( Ennead I.4.10, 17-22; IV.6.2, 18–19).   Plotinus explains in Ennead III.6.15 that an image or representation (φαντασία) is  produced by the faculty of the individual soul functioning in sense perception.  The  interpretation proposed implies that sense objects are living beings and parts of a whole  that is living, active and vibrational.  Objects have a real existence outside the  perceiving subject, but not as images having mass or spatial qualities, since this  depends on an activity of the perceiving soul.  While the eye, for example, receives  affections from external objects, it is an organ of vision (sight), but the soul does the  seeing.  Sensation cannot be understood if we consider impressions of material objects,  as Plotinus argues, or even of their qualities, because it makes the idea of similarity or  assimilation between sense object and sense organ incomprehensible.  The main  difference between this new interpretation and Emilsson’s, is that it places much  greater emphasis on Plotinus being influenced by Pythagorean sympathia which is  underpinned by the science of harmonics, whereas Emilsson suggests that he “adapts”  sympathia  as proposed by the Stoics (Emilsson, 1988, pp.47-48).  Furthermore, he </p><div id="pagenum"><p>241</p></div><p id="page">233   interprets the word mimêma (imitation) as a qualitative image and the new  interpretation considers it a form or forms (vibrations).147  Imitation as an activity  rather than a static image, is also found in Plato in Ion (533e - 535a) and Republic X  (600c - 602b), where he refers to the activities of poets craftsmen and artists who  engage in imitation. Similarly, Aristotle writes of the work of poets and artists as an  activity (Poetics 1447a and 1449a).148  While Emilsson struggles with Plotinus’  concept of sympathia  as it applies to sensation, Pythagorean sympathia  offers a  plausible solution worthy of further investigation in more depth than can be achieved  here.  Plotinus noted the discovery of the nerves by the physicians Herophilus and  Erasistratus in the third century B.C., and acknowledges the view elaborated by Galen,  that impressions received by the sense organs are transmitted to the brain via the nerves  (Ennead IV.3.23, 9-2I), but it is not a view that he adopts.  For Plotinus, it is the  function of the lower soul to unify the sensations received by the sense organs; the  body is however a pre-requisite for sense perception by the individual soul as it acts as  a medium through which the lower  soul perceives.  This brings us to the perception of  the sensation by the soul.  Plotinus states that the soul only contemplates forms ( Ennead I.1.7 14-17), so the  sensations are conveyed to the soul as forms:    the perception of sense objects is for the soul or living being an act of  apprehension, in which the soul understands the quality attaching to bodies and  takes the impression of their forms….when it is by itself [the soul] apprehends  what is in itself, and is pure thought; but if it also apprehends other things it                                                                147  Imitation as ‘μίμησις’ as action rather than a static image, also informs Aquinas’ account         (S.T. 1 Qu.117 art.1) of “art as imitation of nature in her manner of operation.”    148  For a comprehensive analysis of μίμησις in Plato, see Marušič, 2008, Chapters IV and V.     </p><div id="pagenum"><p>242</p></div><p id="page">234   must first have taken possession of them as well, either by becoming  assimilated to them, or by keeping company with something which has been  assimilated. ( Ennead IV.4.23, 1-9)    Being immaterial, the soul is not affected by objects ( Ennead III.6.1, 25-32) and does  not directly receive impressions from them; it receives their impression via the body:    And soul’s power of sense-perception need not be perception of sense-objects,  but rather it must be receptive of the impressions produced by sensation on the  living being; these are already intelligible entities. ( Ennead I.I.7, 9-12).     This brings us to his second account of “likeness”.  The first account referred to things  derived from the same principle, and the second refers to things derived from different  principles:    But in the case of two things of which one is like the other, but the other is  primary, not reciprocally related to the thing in its likeness and not said to be  like it, likeness must be understood in a different sense; we must not require the  same form in both, but rather a different one, since likeness has come about in a  different way. ( Ennead I.2.2, 7-10)    In this passage, “likeness” is not based on similarity of form, but difference of form,  because the form of the soul is not the same as the form of the body; however, while  Plotinus does not speak of their assimilation in terms of sympathia , Chapter 4  explained that the individual soul is attracted to its body because of a ‘correspondence’  or attunement between them.149  Each individual soul must be considered a microcosm  of the Soul at the level of the Hypostasis Soul .  Viewed from the perspective of  harmonics the individual soul is a logos, a form or vibration, just like a body without  its matter.  As such, it can be considered a fundamental  possessing all the logoi in                                                                149  Chapter 4.2, p.108. </p><div id="pagenum"><p>243</p></div><p id="page">235   itself, but only as an imitation of those at the level of the Soul, which in turn possess  the intelligibles as an imitation of Intellect.  Plotinus asserts that we possess the forms  in Intellect either as common to all souls, or, “particular to ourselves”, because each  has the whole of it in the primary part of his soul, “written in us like laws” ( Ennead  V.3.4, 2-3); hence comprehension of the link between perception, memory and  reasoning rests on the notion that Intellect is the primary lawgiver whose laws are  substantial number and form, or logos.150  The stimulation of the soul awakens the faculty of imagination (φαντασία)  (Ennead VI.8.3), which actively unifies the vibrations (forms) it receives from the  various senses to produce a non-extended pictorial image that provides us with  conscious awareness of our experiences ( Ennead IV. 4. 13, 15-17).  If the image creates  consciousness of an object, it makes sense that it will be one that includes the qualities  and quantities associated with the forms.  Plotinus proposes:    Imagination is from a stroke of something irrational from outside: and the soul  is accessible to the stroke because of what in it is not undivided ( Ennead I.8.15,  18-19).    In Intellect the forms are all together and undivided; however, in the soul they are  ‘unfolded and separated’ ( Ennead I.1.8, 1-8) enabling the soul to combine or  differentiate the features each form contains rolled up within it.151  While the  intelligibles in Intellect are akin to those in the soul, so are the intelligibles in sense  objects which it receives in sense perception.  If the soul is attuned to its own body,  they do not have to share a natural frequency because sympathetic resonance also  applies if the body has a frequency that is an integral multiple of that which the soul                                                                150  Chapter 3.3, p.79.   151  Chapter 4.1, p.105. </p><div id="pagenum"><p>244</p></div><p id="page">236   possesses.  An example of this would be that a musical note C will be in sympathetic  resonance with a note C that is an octave or octaves higher or lower.  The assimilation  will not affect the soul, it simply activates the form or vibration that the soul potentially  has within it.   The faculty of imagination is also operative in Plotinus’ account of memory  (Ennead IV.3.29, 31-32) enabling the recognition of objects previously experienced  (Ennead IV.4.13), and as Remes comments, it provides “a unified stream of  consciousness” that temporally connects “past, present and future moments” (Remes,  2007, p.111).  However, being conscious of impressions received from the body is  meaningless unless we understand what we have perceived, and this requires the  faculty of reason operating together with perception and memory.  Memory depends on  the image produced in sense perception, and as Warren rightly states, “Imagination …  is an intimate link which holds the various operations of the human soul together”  (Warren, 1966, p.279); let us now examine how this is achieved.         8.2.2   Reasoning and Memory        Plotinus refers to memory as the past remaining in the present ( Ennead I.5.8, 1-2), and  a memory that may be conscious or unconscious.152  Unconscious memories include  those responsible for habitual behaviour ( Ennead IV.4.4, 7-14) and are not  accompanied by an image, whereas memories must be accompanied by an image if  they are to contribute to our temporal conscious experience, and this is Plotinus’  primary focus.  He proposes, recollection or the soul’s perception of the forms in                                                                152  This view of memory is replicated by Bergson.  See:  Chapter 9.1 pp.255-256; Chapter 9.1.2,        pp.263-266.  </p><div id="pagenum"><p>245</p></div><p id="page">237   Intellect, while being a form of conscious memory, must be differentiated from  temporal memory consisting of the preservation of images arising from sense  perception and discursive thinking. ( Ennead IV.3.25, 30-35).  At its highest level, the  soul remains undescended in Intellect and only acquires a temporal memory when it  descends.   Memory is the preservation of images after the sensation has ceased ( Ennead  IV.3.29, 23-26), and like perception, memory is neither an affection of the soul, nor are  memories stored as mental pictures in the  soul like physical impressions on wax  (Ennead III.6.3, 29-31; IV.6.1, 1-4), so how are memories preserved?  Blumenthal  comments that Plotinus does not provide an account of how the soul retains and recalls  information from sense perception (Blumenthal, 1971, p.83); however, it will be argued  that he does, a view also shared by more recent commentators.153  Memory belongs to  the image-making power that works with forms; therefore, memory as image recall  must also involve forms.  It does not mean that images are stored as images, but as  forms the imagining power uses to present an image to the mind.  This view is  confirmed by Plotinus’ assertion that memory is a power of the soul.  He refers to  memory as “being in a particular state.  And a state is something present, and so is  actuality of life”. ( Ennead I.5.1, 3-6):    The soul awakes the power of memory in such a way as to have what it does not  have …it is a passage from potentiality to actuality. ( Ennead III.6.2, 43-47).    The passage from potentiality to actuality replicates the generative nature of Intellect;  furthermore, memory is “a stable condition” ( Ennead IV.3.26, 52-53) and therefore  non-temporal in nature, even though it is associated with temporal preservation and                                                                153  See also: Chiaradonna, 2015. </p><div id="pagenum"><p>246</p></div><p id="page">238   recall of sense perceptions.  The individual soul possesses the impression of the forms  in Intellect as an imitation but is not conscious of them in the sense that they are “not  active, lying apart and unilluminated” ( Ennead I.2.4, 21-22).  Consciousness of them  arises when the soul directs its attention towards Intellect and they come out from  within (Ennead IV.6.2, 20).  As King comments, the individual soul: “has objects  insofar as it is essentially related to them, not in the sense of having acquired them”  (King, 2009, p.115), therefore recollection is not memory that acquires its objects over  time; it possesses them a priori as potentialities.  So, the forms within the intellect of  the individual soul exist as potentialities and become actualities when they are brought  into consciousness ( Ennead I.1.11, 1-8):    But, being in the middle, it [the soul] perceives both, and is said to think the  intelligibles when it arrives at memory of them, if it comes to be near them; for  it knows them by being them in a way: for it knows not because they settle in it,  but because it has them in some way and sees them and is them in a rather dim  way and becomes them more clearly out of the dimness by a kind of awakening,  and passes from potentiality to actuality. In the same way [the soul] makes the  objects of sense which are, so to speak, connected with it, shine out, one might  say, by its own power, and brings them before its eyes, since its power is ready  for them, and in a way in travail towards them . (Ennead IV. 6. 3, 10-19)    The soul’s a priori potentialities become actualities by the soul’s reasoning power,  which Plotinus refers to as representing the ‘true man’.  Considered as a function of the  soul’s higher aspect, it does not identify itself with the body ( Ennead I.1.10, 3-10), but  has powers found midway between the sensible and intelligible and can therefore direct  its attention towards both.  Its role is to judge or evaluate the sense data received by the  perceptive soul by comparing or ‘fitting it’ to the forms in Intellect, and therefore  differs from sense perception that does not make value judgements but merely  identifies an object is there and its qualities: </p><div id="pagenum"><p>247</p></div><p id="page">239   the reasoning power in soul makes its judgement, derived from the mental  images present to it which come from sense perception, but combining and  dividing them; and, as for the things which come from Intellect, it observes  what one might call their imprints, and has the same power also in dealing with  these; and it continues to acquire understanding as if by recognising the new  and recently arrived impressions and fitting them to those which have long been  within it: this process is what we should call the “recollections” of the soul.  (Ennead V.3.2, 8-14)     Plotinus states the reasoning power judges according to the forms in Intellect, which act  as standards or measures of judgement written into us like laws ( Ennead V.3.4, 16-19),  and as previously explained these laws are those applying to logos, substantial number  and form, that is, the laws of harmonics.  It  is suggested that this is confirmed in  Ennead VI.7, where Plotinus refers to the judgement being possible because the  reasoning power perceives them and there is a correspondence or attunement  (ἁρμονία)  between them:     How, then, is there a power of sense perception in the better soul?  It would be a  power of perceiving the sense objects there, and would correspond to the sense  objects there.  This way, therefore, in which the better soul perceives the  melody of sense  [αἰσθητὴν ἁρμονίαν], when the man of the sense-world  receives it by sense perception and comes into tune  [συναρμόσαντος], to the  last and lowest degree, with the melody [ἐκεῖ ἁρμονίαν] there in the intelligible,  and fire is tuned [ἐκεῖ ἁρμονίαν] to the fire there, of which that better soul had  a perception which corresponded [ἀνάλογον] to the nature of the fire there.  (Ennead VI.7.6, 1-8) [My emphasis and brackets]    It is noteworthy that Armstrong translates ‘ἀνάλογον’ as correspondence without  clarifying that it is proportionate.  Plotinus also refers to the judgement made by  reasoning in the context of sympathia :    Reasoning when it passes judgement on the impressions produced by sensation  is at the same time contemplating forms and contemplating them by a kind of </p><div id="pagenum"><p>248</p></div><p id="page">240   sympathy [συναίσθησις] – I mean the reasoning that belongs to the true soul:  for reasoning is an operation of acts of the intelligence, and there is often a  resemblance and community between what is outside and what is within.  (Ennead I.1.9, 18-23) [My emphasis and brackets.]    In this passage Plotinus does not use the word συμπαθεία which means ‘sympathy’;  however, Armstrong translates συναίσθησις as sympathy in this context.  In in IV.4.8,  20, Plotinus refers to συναίσθησις as consciousness or awareness, and similarly,  Aristotle uses the term in the sense of common or shared consciousness ( Eudemian  Ethics 1245b 21-24)154  Plotinus also notes that we have memories of our thoughts that may, or may not,  be accompanied by an image because we are not always conscious of our thinking.   Consciousness of the discursive thinking of the rational soul must be accompanied by  an image, or copy of the thought ( Ennead IV.3.30, 1-5), while images do not  accompany thinking the forms in Intellect (Ennead 1.4.10, 17-21; IV.6.2, 18-19), hence  our inability to remember them as images; however:     Perhaps the reception into the image-making power would be of the verbal  expression [ logos] which accompanies the act of intelligence. The intellectual  act is without parts and has not, so to speak, come out into the open, but  remains unobserved within, but the verbal expression [ logos] unfolds its  content, and brings it out of the intellectual act into the image-making power  and so shows the intellectual act as if in a mirror, and this is how there is  apprehension and persistence and memory of it. Therefore, even though the soul  is always moved to intelligent activity, it is when it comes to be in the image- making power that we apprehend it. ( Ennead IV.3.30, 5-13 – brackets mine);  see also I.4.10, 6-16)                                                                  154  For an analysis of συναίσθησις in Aristotle, see: Kosman, A., 2014, pp.174-176. </p><div id="pagenum"><p>249</p></div><p id="page">241   In this passage Armstrong translates logos as “verbal expression”; however, it is  suggested that it is easier to comprehend if the act of intelligence involves logos as  substantial number and form, as proposed in Chapter 3.155  This passage proposes the  faculty of imagination (φαντασία) is also operative in the reasoning soul.  In the same  way that the perceptive soul actively unifies the vibrations (forms) it receives from the  various senses to produce a non-extended pictorial image that provides us with  conscious awareness of our experiences of sense perception, the reasoning soul works  with the imagining power to unify the divided logoi or forms the soul has within its own  intellect to make a similar image.  Plotinus suggests the imaging faculty acts like a  mirror; on one side it holds images from sense perception, and on the other it holds  images of the forms the soul possesses.  Reason makes its judgement by placing one  over the other.  When the images are ‘in tune’ they form one image; however, if there is  “conflict or disharmony” both images remain activated for memory but either one of the  images may dominate, depending on whether the soul’s, attention is directed to the  sensible or the intelligible ( Ennead VI.3.31, 9-18).  For Plotinus, in practical life, most  will direct their attention towards the sensible.    The texts support the view that the reasoning power thinks and makes its  judgements by comparing forms and images; however, the passage quoted above  (Ennead IV.3.30.5-13) remains a major source of confusion for commentators.  Warren  comments on this passage as follows:    The chief difficulty with the text is the translation of the term λόγος. Clark  follows Bréhier in translating, la formule verbale . Harder has Begriff (Wort);  MacKenna, 'verbal formula'; and Guthrie, 'reason'. It seems to us that no one  phrase can indicate the entire meaning of λόγος here; and if one is forced to  attempt a translation, Bréhier's is the most acceptable. (Warren, 1965, p.282)                                                                155  Chapter 3.4, pp.82-89. </p><div id="pagenum"><p>250</p></div><p id="page">242   Emilsson also acknowledges a problem with interpreting the meaning of logos in this  passage and considers the unfolded forms in the soul as something like “concepts”,  “notions” or “mental representations”, and finally concurs with Armstrong’s translation  as “verbal expression” (Emilsson, 1988, p.135).  Chiaradonna also claims in this  statement the meaning of logos is “far from clear” and “the opinions of interpreters  greatly vary”, and he suggests “Plotinus … seems to present logos as a thought- structure rather than a verbal expression.  More specifically, he regards logos as a  discursive or predicative unfolding of our higher thoughts”, but he does not explain  what these are (Chiaradonna, 2015, p.12).  Blumenthal notes that Plotinus uses two  terms for the reasoning employed in making judgements, διανοητικὸν, thinking  discursively, and λογιζόμενον, reasoning, and he analyses whether the two terms  should be taken as equivalent.  He concludes they are but notes that Plotinus refers to  them separately at Ennead V.3.3, 18-21 (Blumenthal, 1971, pp.100-102).  Whilst it is  agreed that an analysis of the use of these terms in the Enneads is not conclusive, it is  helpful to consider that Plotinus states: “intellectual activity is normally accompanied  by a mind picture but is not a mind picture” ( Ennead I.4.10, 20-21), which suggests two  kinds of intellectual activity of the reasoning soul as described in Ennead V.3:    soul is a kind of intellect in that it is discursively intelligent – it has its power  through and from Intellect. … it comes to know what it sees and knows what it  speaks … it is a rational principle and receives things akin to it, and fits them to  the traces in itself. ( Ennead V.3.6, 20-28)    At V.3.3 Plotinus states that:  … sense-perception sees a human being and gives its impression to discursive  reason [διάνοίᾳ]. What does reason say? It will not say anything yet, but only  knows, and stops at that; unless perhaps it asks itself “who is this? If it has met  the person before, and says, using memory to help it, that it is Socrates. And if it </p><div id="pagenum"><p>251</p></div><p id="page">243   makes the details of this form explicit, it is taking to pieces what the image- making power gave it. ( Ennead V.3.3, 1-7.  Brackets, mine.)    As Blumenthal notes, later in the same section, Plotinus makes a clear distinction  between διανοητικὸν and λογιστικὸν when refers to the soul reasoning on the  illumination from Intellect:    … it must be soul that is engaged in reasoning [λογισμοῖς]; and all this is the  work of the reasoning [λογιζσμένης] power. …But if someone were to say  “What prevents this part of the soul from observing what belongs to itself by  another power? He is not looking for the power of discursive reasoning   [διανοητικὸν] or rationality [λογιστικὸν], but in grasping pure Intellect.  (Ennead  V.3.3, 14-7.  Brackets, mine.)    Liddell Scott translates λογισμοῖς as ‘counting’ or ‘calculation’, and Armstrong  translates λογιζόμενον as ‘calculation’ in Ennead IV.12, where the subject is addressed  at length, and where Plotinus asks:    For what else could calculation be but the effort to find intelligence and reason  which is true and attains the truly existent? (Ennead IV.12, 6-8)    Therefore, it makes sense to consider διανοητικόν as thinking in concepts, i.e. words or  images, facilitated by the imaging power of the soul, and λογιζόμενον (or any form of  reasoning where λόγος appears to be the root), as reasoning that specifically addresses  logos as substantial number and form, as explained in Chapter 3.  This is consistent with  a theory that is based on harmonics and vibrations, especially, as was noted in Chapter  7, that for the Pythagoreans, logismos is a form of harmonia  or rational calculation,  where opposites are fitted together using numbers or proportions to provide knowledge  and understanding about the world, as well as forming the basis of ethical action.156                                                                  156  Chapter 7.2, pp.217-218. </p><div id="pagenum"><p>252</p></div><p id="page">244   Without mentioning it explicitly, Plotinus provides a further clue to the nature of  rationality involved in λογιζόμενον when he refers to the musician who is naturally  disposed to the beauty of the intelligibles, but he begins with sounds and rhythms  perceived by the senses:    He must be led and taught to make abstraction of the material element in them  and come to the principles from which their proportions and ordering forces  derive and to the beauty which is in these principles, and learn that this was  what excited him, the intelligible harmony and the beauty in it, and beauty  universal, not just some particular beauty,  and he must have the doctrines of  philosophy implanted in him; by these he must be brought to firm confidence in  what he possesses without knowing it. ( Ennead I.3.1, 30-35)    By stripping away the material element in sound, the musician arrives at “the principles  from which their proportions and ordering forces derive”.  In effect he wants the  musician to understand the numbers associated with harmonics.  Panaiotidi suggests  music has worth for Plotinus “only as a means of ascent to a higher reality, and this  capacity is grounded in its mathematical nature” (Panaiotidi, 2014, p. 409).  This also  explains why Plotinus considers training in mathematics to be essential for the  philosopher, a training that must occur before dialectic.  He states in ‘On Dialectic’:    He [the philosopher] is by nature virtuous, and must be brought to perfect his  virtues, and after his mathematical studies instructed in dialectic, and made a  complete dialectician. ( Ennead I.3.4, 8-9)    He continues to describe dialectic as the process of consciously rising to Intellect:  It is the science which can speak about everything in a reasoned and orderly  way, and say what it is and how it differs from other things and what it has in  common with those among which it is. ( Ennead I.3.4, 2-4)   </p><div id="pagenum"><p>253</p></div><p id="page">245   Dialectic distinguishes what is true and good from what is not, but, importantly, it is a  process of collection, division and definition of the contents of Intellect, thus following  Plato’s account of dialectic in the Phaedrus  in which he describes collection and  division “as aids to speech and thought”  (Phdr.265b3-266c1, in Fowler, 1914, p.535).  It  therefore makes sense that for Plotinus λογιζόμενον, the fitting together of musical  ratios and the forms associated with them, is what he refers to as theoretical wisdom,  which precedes, and is an ‘aid’ to  διανοητικόν , discursive thinking, or practical  wisdom, but both are necessary.  One must be able to ascend to a higher level of soul  or even Intellect itself to make a judgement based on harmonia , or the fitting together  of opposites, before being able to speak or think about it discursively as words or  images, which is a descending movement because it is directed towards external  objects (Ennead V.3.2-3).  The idea of ‘before and after’ must be considered as one of  priority in Plotinus’ kairos rather than having a temporal context.   While the explanation here potentially resolves the difficulty perceived by  commentators, it is speculative and not exhaustive; hence further in-depth analysis of  how Plotinus uses διανοητικόν and λογιζόμενον in the Enneads is warranted, not only  for clarification for those commenting on Plotinus’ psychology, but it could be  significant for anyone translating the Enneads.    The operation of sense perception, reasoning and memory can therefore be  summarised along these lines: sense perception becomes conscious of an object by  unifying the forms it receives from the senses using the imagining power to form a  qualitative image.  To judge the nature of the image from sense perception, reason  divides the image into its appropriate forms and makes an initial movement towards  Intellect (recollection) with which it is in tune, and Intellect makes it conscious, or  activates the forms the soul possesses potentially in a divided state.  The imaging power </p><div id="pagenum"><p>254</p></div><p id="page">246   then generates an image from those forms by combining them.  Once activated, the  forms serve as memory and are ready for future use ( Ennead IV 6 3, 58-59).  The  reasoning power compares the forms and image from sense perception with those  activated in itself to provide knowledge about the object.  The activated forms may be  recalled by the reasoning power to make its judgement when the same or similar forms  are encountered again in sense perception or discursive reasoning, and the power of  memory is ‘strengthened’ with repetition ( Ennead IV.6.3, 39-40), making recognition  much faster because reasoning does not need to search all the potentialities in the soul.   This is the accepted interpretation by recent commentators;157 however, a modern  metaphor may be helpful to clarify Plotinus’ meaning: a computer’s hard drive contains  all the information that is potentially available for us to access, and if a word or  filename is typed into the computer for the first time, it will search its hard drive to find  the file or files most fitting to the search entry.  Having selected a file and opened it, the  computer stores the file as a temporary file in its active memory, meaning that any  future access to that file will be much quicker.  There is no need to search the whole  hard drive again.  The metaphor is not quite correct, though, because the computer does  store temporary files in its active memory, whereas for Plotinus, there is no separate  storage of memory, just an activation of potentialities, as if they are switched on in  temporal order and are ready to use immediately, with the most recent being the most  accessible.  The beauty of his theory is that it provides an account of memory that  retains its stability, that is, it preserves significant perceptions unchanged because it is  an activation of a potentiality.  The storage of memory does not become an issue  because memory is not something acquired, and memory retrieval is simply the  reasoning faculty accessing forms already activated.                                                                 157  King, 2009; Emilsson, 1988; Chiaradonna, 2015 </p><div id="pagenum"><p>255</p></div><p id="page">247   Having established the mechanism by which the reasoning power judges and  remembers its experiences, it is now pertinent to clarify how Plotinus interprets the  freedom of the individual soul.         8.3   The Freedom of the Individual Soul        The concept of freedom as ‘ἐφ’ ἡμῖν’, or ‘that which is in our power’, ‘that which is in  our control’, or ‘that which depends on us’, as explained in respect of the World Soul , is  also important for understanding human freedom.  Plotinus refers to it in: ‘On Well- Being’ (Ennead I.4), ‘On Destiny’  (Ennead III.1), ‘On Providence (I)’  (Ennead III.2),  ‘On Numbers’  (Ennead VI.6) and ‘On Free Will and the Will of the One’ ( Ennead  VI.8).  It is a subject analysed in depth by several commentators who tend to agree in  their interpretations. 158  Of particular interest is that of Eliasson, who has placed it  within its historical context and conducted a helpful review of the various  interpretations of its use in the Enneads, classifying them under the headings of  ‘Freedom’, ‘Free Choice’, ‘Free Will’, ‘Free Action’, and ‘Self Determination’  (Eliasson, 2008, pp.27-42).  The most detailed account of ἐφ’ ἡμῖν in the context of  human life given in Ennead VI.8, ‘On Free Will and the Will of the One’, which is also  highly relevant for understanding its relationship to knowledge:    Everything is a voluntary act which we do without being forced to and with  knowledge [of what we are doing], and in our power which we are also  competent to do. ( Ennead VI.8.1, 33-34)                                                                  158  Eliasson, 2008; Leroux, 1996; Ousager, 2005; Remes, 2007; Westra, 1990; Westra, 2002 </p><div id="pagenum"><p>256</p></div><p id="page">248   If one of these attributes is missing an act is not within our power.  For action to be  voluntary it happens because we wish it and with nothing opposing our wishes; it  cannot arise from “opposing chances …, compulsions and strong assaults of passions  possessing our soul” ( Ennead VI.8.1, 28-30).  Plotinus states, while the body receives  many incidental impressions from its physical environment, the soul only becomes  conscious of those to which its attention is directed ( Ennead IV.4.8, 1-17).  Remes,  referring to Ennead IV.4.8, 17-20, comments in this respect there is a “voluntary  element”, an element of choice in that the soul selects the forms that will ultimately  form an image on the basis that they are significant for us (Remes, 2007, p. 113);  however for Plotinus, the ability to choose sense objects does not make the soul free if  the motive of action is an unreasoned need or compulsion arising from an exterior  source.  In his account of sense perception, action based on unreasoned images is  merely opinion resulting in the enslavement of living beings to the sense world.   Opinion is: “What we call thinking falsities…making of mind pictures which has not  waited for the judgement of the reasoning faculty” ( Ennead I.1.9, 8-9), and therefore  has not taken the intelligible truths into account.  Warren explains:    It is precisely the possession of and knowing through images that distinguishes  human knowledge from the knowledge of Nous; for the human being possesses  images rather than the objects themselves and, consequently, can never have  truth but only opinion. (Warren, 1966, p. 279)    Plotinus suggests that action based on mistaken belief or ignorance is not considered  voluntary; the knowledge accompanying a particular act must “apply in particular  circumstances” and “generally”; “generally” here meaning what we ‘ought’ to do in the  situation.  “Not knowing that one ought to have learnt it is not voluntary, nor is what  leads one away from learning” ( Ennead VI.8.1, 39-45).  </p><div id="pagenum"><p>257</p></div><p id="page">249   In Ennead VI.8.2, Plotinus suggests calculation and impulses, or desires not  driven by ‘lust’ or ‘passion’, are also not in our power if the calculation accompanying  the desire is wrong, for example, the desires and impulses of children, wild animals,  individuals with mental illness, and those under the influence of drugs.  If the  calculation is right we cannot say whether the motivating force was the calculation or  the desire; and if the desire is of the composite living being, that is, soul with body in  accordance with nature, “the soul followed the necessity of nature”; and if it is purely a  desire of the soul, “many of the things which are now said to be in our power will be  outside it”.  Similarly, if we feel compelled by the imagination, or if desire pulls or  leads us, and whenever the motivating force does not originate from ourselves.   Plotinus then proceeds to examine the question of knowledge, dismissing knowledge  from sense perception alone because it is merely based on a bodily affection.   Knowledge of a situation does not itself lead to action and ἐφ’ ἡμῖν does not mean  action effected by rationally overcoming desires with another desire.       Ennead VI.8.3 continues the examination of knowledge in terms of its rationality.   Action based on opinion, even if that opinion is right, is not founded on right reasoning  if the person does not know why his opinion is right; this is pure chance.  Opinions  resulting in action based on chance and imagination arising from bodily experiences are  not within our power.  He only defines voluntary or truly free action as that derived  from the activity of Intellect (Ennead VI.8.3, 19-23).   Ennead VI.8.5 addresses freedom of the soul in its two aspects, the first of which  contemplates Intellect, and the second, its engagement in practical action and virtue.   What does Plotinus mean by virtue?  He proposes two kinds of virtue; the first are civic  virtues which “give limit and measure to our desires, and putting measure into all our  experience, hence they abolish false opinion”; and these depend on the second type, </p><div id="pagenum"><p>258</p></div><p id="page">250   which he refers to as “greater virtues” being “a measure which forms the matter of the  soul” (Ennead I.2.2, 14-19).  The matter of the soul must be understood as its  ‘intelligibles’, substantial number and form as an imitation of Intellect, and which act  as measures for reason when deciding on practical action.      Virtue is a kind of other intellect, a state which in a way intellectualises the  soul, … being in our power does not belong to the realm of action but in  intellect at rest from action. ( Ennead VI.8.5, 34-37)    He claims virtuous action is dependent on external situations, for example, brave action  in war depends on there being a war; however, if the action arises from will or reason  that compels us to certain action, we can say that freedom resides in virtue prior to  action. Virtue is wishing and choosing the good.  In Ennead VI.8.6 and 7, Plotinus  asserts being in our power rests within the province of virtue and Intellect because they  “have no master”.  While Intellect is independent in itself, “virtue wishes to be  independent by supervising the soul to make it good”.  When things happen that have  not been wished for by the soul, it will not respond emotionally to what is occurring  outside, but will refer to virtue to guide its action:    The soul … becomes free when it presses on without hindrance to the Good by  means of Intellect, and what it does through this is in its power. ( Ennead VI.8.7,  1-3)      Reason in its highest form is then, for Plotinus, ascending to Intellect and  contemplating Intellect by becoming one with it and remaining there,  and this is  ultimately what is in our power.  This cannot be achieved in practical life, because the  soul does not remain in Intellect; it must act, and the succeeding action, even one  arising from reason, “cannot have being in our power in a pure state” because it is </p><div id="pagenum"><p>259</p></div><p id="page">251   “mixed”, where ‘mixed’ means a combination of internal and external action ( Ennead  VI.8.2, 37-38).  In summary, from the formation of the image in sense perception that gives  conscious awareness of external objects or events, the succeeding action is based on  different types of knowledge: opinion; the greater virtues in the soul that form the basis  of civic virtues; and true knowledge, formed when the soul takes its knowledge directly  from Intellect.  The third type of knowledge is only available to the wise, who  contemplate the forms there while living a corporeal life, but not allowing the external  world to influence their action.  In Ennead III.6.2, Plotinus presents his arguments for the notions of virtue and  vice, a view that “accords with the view of the ancients”.  Armstrong provides a  footnote clarifying his reference to “the ancients” as “the Pythagoreans; cp. Plato,  Phaedo 93c”.159  Plotinus explains that for the ancients, virtue was considered to be a  harmony of the soul’s powers which bring nothing in from the outside; whereas vice is  disharmony, which is evil when reason may not function to its full potential because it  may be overridden by another faculty such as desire.         Conclusion           This chapter examined Plotinus’ concept of time, the life of the soul, as kairos, both in  its application to the World Soul  in the making of the external world, and to the  individual soul in its interaction with its corporeal environment. In both instances  kairos is contemplation, a contemplation that is paradoxical because it is at once a                                                                159  Ennead III.6.2, Armstrong’s fn. p.214 </p><div id="pagenum"><p>260</p></div><p id="page">252   necessary process and an act of freedom or ἐφ’ ἡμῖν, as Plotinus defines it.  The World  Soul fulfils the requirements for ἐφ’ ἡμῖν because it is not under outside influence, what  it makes is within its power and its knowledge is right knowledge or wisdom because it  contemplates the forms in Intellect, the Beings of eternal truth.  We find the same  definition of freedom in the individual soul for whom the goal is the Good.  In analysing Plotinus’ psychology, the key concepts implicated in kairos include  sense perception, memory, reason, and freedom.  Plotinus appropriates the concept  from its Pythagorean origins and is rational-ethical.  Kairos is not a static moment for  Plotinus because deciding action appropriate to the circumstances involves a movement  from the material word to contemplation of the forms that the individual soul possesses  in itself, or ideally those in Intellect.  The function of sense perception, memory and  reasoning all depend on Providence because it endows the human soul with everything  it needs to become free because virtuous actions are “not done by providence but  according to providence: for it is in tune with the rational principle” ( Ennead III.3.5,  47-49).  Providence enables us, with the appropriate training, to think like Intellect, that  is, to think substantial numbers and forms, or as has been argued, to think and act  according to the laws of harmonics.  The model of harmonics once again has the potential to resolve ambiguities in the  text and overcome two important difficulties experienced by commentators; his theory  of sense perception as sympathia  and the role of λογιζόμενον and διανοητικόν in the  activities of the reasoning soul; however, both warrant further investigation due to the  limited scope of the analysis presented here.    The concept of kairos in the Enneads is ultimately dependent on the model of  harmonics that has the ability to unite Plotinus’ cosmology and psychology, thus  transforming our understanding by making sense of Plotinus’ philosophy as a complete </p><div id="pagenum"><p>261</p></div><p id="page">253   system.  It also suggests that the Pythagorean influence is more important than  previously recognised.  The next Chapter will continue to examine the concept of kairos in the context of  Bergson’s psychological duration.                                               </p><div id="pagenum"><p>262</p></div><p id="page">254   Chapter 9    Bergson and Kairos    *      Introduction        J.M. Gabaude, in his article, Éclairage Sur Le Kairos A Partir De La Philosophie De  Bergson, suggests: “… by appealing to kairicity, it is possible to shed light on certain  features of Bergson and, conversely, he enables clarification of kairos.”  He refers to  Vladimir Jankélévitch who considered kairos as “implicit in marrying the key  elements” of Bergson’s philosophy (Gebaude, 1991, p.349).  Bergson has therefore  been recognised as a philosopher of kairicity in French language articles, and while it  has been discussed in very general terms, it has been relatively unacknowledged in the  English language secondary literature.  This Chapter aims to provide a deeper understanding of the relevance of kairos to  Bergson’s philosophy and will explain how he utilises this ancient concept as one that  is dynamic and generative in his theories of perception and memory as proposed in  Matter and Memory , and how it is intimately connected to his understanding of  individual freedom as proposed in the Two Sources of Morality and Religion .  Finally,  it will be proposed that kairos in Bergson’s philosophical method may have been  inspired by ancient Greek rhetoric under the influence of the Pythagorean tradition.                </p><div id="pagenum"><p>263</p></div><p id="page">255   9.1   Perception, Memory, and Kairos          Gebaude refers to kairos as “a highlight” in psychological life, “a critical threshold, a  nodal point of fact, a significant note of the ‘continuous melody of our inner life’;  melody which does not differentiate between before and after, and without having a  punctual present” (Gebaude, 1991, p.356), which means it must not be considered a  mathematical point in time because it is a moment in which the past, present and future  coincide.  In Mind-Energy  Bergson describes consciousness in terms that capture the  essence of the mythological depiction of Kairos in ancient Greece.160     To retain what no longer is, to anticipate what as yet is not, - these are the  primary functions of consciousness.  For consciousness there is no present, if  the present be a mathematical instant.  An instant is the purely theoretical limit  which separates the past from the future.  It may, in the strict sense, be  conceived, it is never perceived.  When we think we have seized hold of it, it is  already far away.  What we actually perceive is a certain span of duration  composed of two parts – our immediate past and our immediate future.  We  lean on the past, we bend forward on the future: leaning and bending forward is  the characteristic attitude of a conscious being.  Consciousness is then, as it  were, the hyphen which joins what has been to what will be, the bridge which  spans the past and the future. (‘Life and Consciousness’, in M.E., p.8-9)    Kairos is exemplified in Bergson’s illustration of the cone (Figure 21) in Matter and  Memory ( M.M., p.197, Figure 4).                                                                                 160  Chapter 7.1, p.212. </p><div id="pagenum"><p>264</p></div><p id="page">256   Bergson’s Cone Illustration (Figure 21)        In the above illustration, S represents the “nodal point of fact” or “significant note of  the continuous melody of our inner life”, as referred to by Gebaude.  It represents  perception, or what Bergson refers to as “both a perception of the immediate past  [memory] and a determination of the immediate future [matter]” (M.M., p.177), and a  synthesis or coincidence of opposites defined by Bergson as pure perception (P) and  pure memory (AB) that act as limits representing differences in kind.  Each of these  concepts will be examined in turn; however it is important to note that once again  Bergson employs the generative structure of Pythagorean cosmology’ differentiation  and integration, where integration or harmonia  generates novelty, a harmonic, and  represents the moment of kairos.        9.1.1   Pure Perception        In Chapter 1 of Matter and Memory  Bergson begins his account of perception by  proposing a theory of ‘pure perception’ that he defines as:   </p><div id="pagenum"><p>265</p></div><p id="page">257   a perception that exists in principle rather than in fact, and would be possessed  by a being placed where I am, living as I live, but absorbed in the present, and  which is capable, through the elimination of memory in all its forms, of  obtaining a vision of matter both immediate and instantaneous. (M.M., p.26)    Pure perception is therefore a hypothetical construct that eliminates the influence of  memory, even though this never happens in fact.  Bergson denounces realism and  idealism for failing to capture the nature of matter as we experience it, and proposes a  compromise, a theory based on common sense, that matter is constituted by what he  calls an “aggregate of images”:    And by ‘image’ we mean a certain existence which is more than that which the  idealist calls a representation , but less than that which the realist calls a thing, -  an existence placed half-way between the ‘thing’ and the ‘representation’.  (M.M., p.vii-viii)    Bergson suggests extended matter exists as images that are present merely as a picture;  a surface that does not have determined outlines, but which emits light consisting of  colours that blend into each other, like a work of art that has depth or a reflection in a  mirror.  The images are not inert and spatially extended because at its fundamental  level matter is nothing more than a “pervading concrete extensity, modifications,  perturbations, changes of tension or energy and nothing else” (M.M., p.266), an  unlimited field of energy in which varying vibrations or durations coexist and  reciprocally interact with each other in a dynamic and undivided continuity.  He  regards the dynamic nature of matter as extensive such that matter is these vibrations  rather than vibrations extended in a spatial medium.  There is no perceiving subject or  mechanism that translates the vibrations into qualities because the vibrational aspect of  matter is present in the colours,  just as red light is a specific wavelength on the  electromagnetic spectrum, or, as Lawlor comments, ‘just as when we strike a key of the </p><div id="pagenum"><p>266</p></div><p id="page">258   piano at the low end of the scale, we hear the note and can see the vibrations of the  string’ (Lawlor, 2004, p.7).  As was explained in Chapter 5 consciousness and matter  develop in succession as two individual élans,161 hence matter generates harmonics  within itself that represent qualitative differences external to the perceiving subject.  Guerlac explains that images are not produced by us, but they are images of things  (Guerlac, 2006, p.117).  Bergson therefore follows Plotinus in rejecting any notion of  subjective idealism because matter has an existence independent of the consciously  perceiving subject.162    Bergson claims the body is an image amongst images that interacts with its  environment according to mathematically determined laws and which apply to physics  in its “remotest aspirations” (M.M., p.260).  It was argued in Chapters 5 and 6 that  Bergson understood the mathematics underpinning the physics of waves as studied in  acoustics and optics, and to which the concepts of harmonics, sympathetic resonance,  interference, both constructive and destructive, as well as reflection and refraction were  considered basic.163  In his account of pure perception, it was these laws that Bergson  appropriated to matter long before the notion that matter behaves like a wave was  proposed by Louis de Broglie in 1924, as he notes later in The Creative Mind  (C.M.,  p.71).  Bergson claims in pure perception the body isolates an object by suppressing  other objects that have no interest for it (M.M., pp.28-29).  It does this by reflecting   other images so that “pure perception stands towards matter in the relation of part to  whole” (M.M., p.78); hence there  can only be a difference in degree, and not a  difference in kind, between matter and pure perception (M.M., p.19; p.24).  Bodies                                                                161  Chapter 5.3, pp.159-160.  162  Chapter 8.2.1, p.232.  163  For references, see: Chapter 5.3 p.164; Chapter 6.6, p.207-208.   </p><div id="pagenum"><p>267</p></div><p id="page">259   “allow to pass through them… those external influences which are indifferent to them;  the others become ‘perceptions’ by their very isolation” (M.M., pp.28-29).  He states:    everything thus happens for us as though we reflected back to the surfaces the  light which emanates from them, the light which, had it passed on unopposed,  would never have been revealed” (M.M., p.29).    Bergson suggests that when light passes from one medium to another the light is  refracted; however, the densities of the media may be such that there is total reflection,  in which case an outlined image is formed indicating possible or virtual actions of the  body in space.  He is drawing on the physics of light and the law of ‘reflection’ that  occurs when objects stand out because the frequencies of light waves of the object do  not match the natural frequencies of light shining on it.  For Bergson, a body is an  image itself and therefore vibrational, so for example, if the object is emitting all the  colours of the spectrum and the body lacks red light, red light will be reflected onto the  object while the other colours will pass through the body or be absorbed because the  body would vibrate in sympathetic resonance with them and they will not stand out.   Bergson appears to interpret the body’s ‘lack’ as a condition of need or interest that  isolates objects because our needs are “so many search-lights which, directed upon the  continuity of sensible qualities, single out in it distinct bodies” because the need is  reflected in the object (M.M., p.262).  Behind the object there is a virtual world of  matter that remains unperceived.  Unlike Plotinus who employs sympathia  in terms of  sound vibrations to reveal similarities, Bergson applies it to light vibrations to reveal  differences in the continuity of matter thus accounting for individuation and the  creation of the other.164  Either way, resonance is the principle that explains the                                                                164  See: Mullarkey, 2004, p.478 </p><div id="pagenum"><p>268</p></div><p id="page">260   perception of an external object and the law of reflection enables Bergson to claim, as  does Plotinus, that the pure perception of an object occurs in the object itself; not in us,  because we do not project unextended sensations outside ourselves:    … my perception is outside my body, and my affection within it. Just as  external objects are perceived by me where they are, in themselves and not in  me, so my affective states are experienced there where they occur, that is, at a  given point in my body. (M.M., p.59)165    Let us now consider the mechanics of the body in pure perception. He suggests  that the body does not only reflect external images:    It struggles and thus absorbs some part of this action.  Here is the source of  affection.  We might therefore say, metaphorically, that while perception  measures the reflecting power of the body, affection measures its power to  absorb. (M.M., p.57)     Having isolated an object by reflecting on it, Bergson proposes that each of the  qualities perceived in an object by the different sense organs are determined by a  particular need or direction of activity (M.M., p.46).  He refers to the sense organ as  analogous to:    An immense keyboard, on which the external object executes at once its  harmony of a thousand notes, thus calling forth in a definite order, and at a  single moment, a great multitude of elementary sensations corresponding to all  the points of the sensory centre that are concerned. (M.M., p.165)     The vibrations received are separated according to the frequencies that each sense  organ can receive and then travel via the nerves to the brain, which analyses and                                                                165 On this point, see: Lacey, 2008, p.84.   </p><div id="pagenum"><p>269</p></div><p id="page">261   chooses the appropriate motor response of the body and sends the appropriate  vibrations through the spinal cord to stimulate physical movement.  The function of the  brain is to allow communication or delay it (M.M., p.30), hence it merely receives and  transmits vibrations; it does not make representations or speculate, because it is only a  material image amongst others.  For Bergson the brain is not an instrument of  knowledge, but an instrument of choice, and, like Plotinus, he considers the body, a  centre of action and sensation (M.M., p.178).  He describes sensation as: “in its  essence, extended and localized” (M.M., p.180) and “that which must be subtracted  from perception to get the image in its purity” (M.M., p.60).  In pure perception, the  object, the sense organ and the nerves that stimulate action form a continuous whole,  and while the body is the point of contact with the rest of matter, sensation admits a  distinction between the body and external objects because it is internal to the body  while perceptions are external (M.M., p.42; p.63).   Sensation is the real action of matter  and represents the immediate past, while perception reflects possible action and  represents anticipation of the immediate future.  Pure perception is wholly in the  present, not as a mathematical instant, but is simultaneously the immediate past and  immediate future, which he describes as consisting in an impending action, in an  energy not yet spent (M.M., p.185) or unused; however, he suggests “we have no grasp  of the future without an equal and corresponding outlook over the past” (M.M., pp.69- 70).  Bergson claims the choice of possible actions and continuity of perception  requires past experience and therefore memory, and since he thinks of it as a melody,  he concurs with Aristoxenus who proposed that the “understanding ( xynesis) of music  arises from two sources, perception and memory; for one must perceive what is coming </p><div id="pagenum"><p>270</p></div><p id="page">262   into being, and remember what has come into being”  (Aristoxenus, Elements of  Harmonics , 38.27-39.3).166          9.1.2   The Preservation of Memories        Bergson argued that the physics of Kelvin and Faraday can only lead to the hypothesis  that matter is ontologically dynamic (M.M., pp.265-266) and he suggested that the  internal nature of mater is vibrational and therefore repetitive.  While matter simply  repeats the past, a being that evolves creates something new at every moment (M.M.,  p.297) and memory is vital for continuity in the creative process as well as  implementing choice and freedom of movement (M.M., p.69-70).  He states: “With the  immediate and present data of our senses we mingle a thousand details out of our past  experience” (M.M., p.24); hence “the reaction does not take place without an appeal to  the memories which analogous situations may have left behind them” (M.M., p.69).  So  how are memories preserved and recollected?  In Chapter 6 it was noted that élan vital  is generated as a supra-conscious  memory that possesses all degrees of consciousness, including intellect, instinct,  intuition, as well as the latent consciousness of unorganised matter and the sleeping  consciousness of immobile vegetable matter.    According to the model of the generation  of harmonics “the past is preserved by itself, automatically” (C.E., p.5), and we find  that the same model accounts for the preservation and recollection of our individual  memories.  Bergson said that his aim in Matter and Memory  was to overcome the  Cartesian dualism of extended matter and unextended mind by establishing the                                                                166  Chapter 2.4, p.53. </p><div id="pagenum"><p>271</p></div><p id="page">263   distinction between them in terms of time, not space (M.M., p.294), and he achieves  this by integrating them under the concept of consciousness that has a durational or  vibrational nature.  This is an ontological claim rather than an interpretive description  because he believes that since the physics of his day considered matter as vibrational,  the same concept must explain the durational and substantial nature of consciousness.   Only the notion of tension or vibration can reconcile matter and memory, or physics  and metaphysics.  This reconciliation occurs in perception to facilitate the integration of  individual consciousnesses or mind with a material body and other material objects  when the individual consciousness condenses the vibrations of matter within its own  vibration, a condensation that occurs on the basis of attunement, or “correspondence”  between them.167 Underlying the concept of “correspondence” is the notion that there  are differences in number behind our distinctions of quality” (‘Introduction II’, in C.M.,  p.58-59); hence Bergson’s assertion that consciousness “stores up the past by the  necessity of its own nature” (M.M., p.92).  The past is retained as two types of  memory; the first is a “quasi-instantaneous memory” (M.M., p.197) or habit that tends  to be non-representational, unconscious, and consists in the mechanical repetition of  bodily movements or cue reactions to objects perceived in the present.  It is directed to  action and therefore the future; hence it does not conserve images of the past but  “prolongs their useful effect into the present moment” (M.M., p.93) by acting them.   Bergson refers to the second type of memory as “spontaneous” memory or “true  memory” (M.M., p.195) that is represented by the cone in his illustration.  While he  refutes the notion that memories are stored in the brain, he reluctantly acknowledges  that they are in the mind (‘Soul and Body’, in M.E., p.68).   Perceptions are duplicated  once in memory as a virtual mirror image or reflection of actual perception (M.M.,                                                                167  See Chapter 6.1, p.175. </p><div id="pagenum"><p>272</p></div><p id="page">264   p.165) and he appears to suggest that true memory records present perceptions as  memory-images:     [It] records, in the form of memory-images, all the events of our daily life as  they occur in time; it neglects no detail; it leaves to each fact, to each gesture,  its place and date. (M.M., p.92)    For Bergson a memory-image is a mixture of memory and the image of pure perception  because neither exists alone; perception always consists of both; however, just as in  pure perception where images are vibrational without clearly defined outlines in space,  memory-images are also vibrational but without limits in time.  So, while memories are  recorded as memory-images, they are not stored as isolated images in pure memory  because they are always attached to what preceded and what followed them; they are “a  succession of states each one of which announces what follows and contains what  precedes” (‘Introduction to Metaphysics’, in C.M., p.163).  Pure memory is  “coextensive with consciousness” and is the survival of the past as a totality of life  experience.  Bergson claims pure memory contains virtual memories that are powerless  and unchanged (M.M., p.163),  and is a memory that is revealed in our character (M.M.,  p.191), becoming larger as life advances:    [it] retains and ranges alongside of each other all our states in the order in which  they occur, leaving to each fact its place and, consequently, marking its date,  truly moving in the past and not, like the first, in an ever renewed present.  (M.M., p.195)    Therefore, at the other extreme of pure perception and habit memory, which is sensori- motor and aimed at action in space, pure memory is the past, detached from life, and  like unperceived matter has a virtual, powerless or unconscious existence because it no  longer acts.  Deleuze remarks: </p><div id="pagenum"><p>273</p></div><p id="page">265   We have great difficulty in understanding the survival of the past in itself  because we believe that the past is no longer, that it has ceased to be. We have  thus confused Being with being present. Nevertheless, the present is not; rather,  it is pure becoming, always outside itself. It is not, but acts. Its proper element  is not being but the active or useful. The past, on the other hand, has ceased to  act or to be useful. But it has not ceased to be. Useless and inactive, impassive,  it IS in the full sense of the word. It is identical with being in itself. (Deleuze,  1991, p.55)    It is important to clarify that in the above quotation Deleuze is referring to “being  present” in terms of “the present “, i.e. “now” as a point in time, which he rightly refers  to as “becoming” not “being”.   If, as Bergson claims, that pure memory is revealed in  our character, it has ontological presence in the present, the moment of kairos, which is  a synthesis of pure perception and pure memory.  Deleuze refers to the unchanging  existence of memories as an “ontological memory” and “a pure being of the past”  (Deleuze, 1991, p. 59).  While each individual consciousness has its own personal pure  memory, pure memory extends beyond the individual in the form of the élan vital ; an  impersonal supra-consciousness that contains all individual histories or memories, as  well as matter in itself.  Bergson can therefore claim it to be supra-conscious because is  constituted from all degrees of consciousness.  It therefore possesses the presence of its  past in its entirety, thus replicating the unchanging nature of Plotinus’ Intellect, a  similarity noted by several commentators.168  From the perspective of Plotinus, this is  accurate for most of the individual souls who are unconscious of Intellect, and it must  also be acknowledged that while Plotinus does not refer to Intellect as memory, he                                                                168  See, for example: Gale, 1973-1974; Lovejoy, 1912; Maritain, 1968, p.236; Taylor, 1911,        pp.101-107     </p><div id="pagenum"><p>274</p></div><p id="page">266   states: “intellect has the memory of its products in itself” ( Ennead V. 3. 8, 53).   Intellect is not a memory that evolves in time as Bergson’s does:      the whole of history might be contained in a very short time for a consciousness  at a higher degree of tension than our own, which should watch the  development of humanity while contracting it, so to speak, into the great phases  of its evolution. (M.M., p.275)    For Bergson memory-images are only actualised in perception through a process of  recognition and recollection.         9.1.3   The Recognition and Recollection of Memories        Bergson applies the principles of gestalt to his theory of perception.  These principles  describe how the human mind fills in gaps between elements to perceive a complete  image so that the whole is perceived first.  The object is constructed by the mind not  seen by the eye.   For Bergson, pure perception perceives matter in its most simplistic  form that excludes familiarity, while the mind or memory fills in the details and creates  a sense of familiarity and meaning from what is perceived.  Perception is therefore an  act of creation or invention.  In the fourth Chapter of Matter and Memory  Bergson states that “it is from the  present that comes the appeal to which memory responds” (M.M., p.197); however, he  suggests “in most cases recollection emerges only after the perception is recognised”  (M.M., p.107):    the ordinary feeling of recognition has its root in the consciousness of the  organisation of motor accompaniments.  We act our recognition before we think  it. (M.M., p.93) </p><div id="pagenum"><p>275</p></div><p id="page">267   Recognition therefore has two aspects: Bergson defines the first as recognition by  inattention that produces a feeling of familiarity arising from the consciousness of  sensations and impending automatic bodily reactions; the second is attentive  recognition that “requires the regular intervention of memory images”, which seem to  repeat the present perception (M.M., p.118).  The two types of memory are  complementary and mutually supportive (M.M., p.112-113).  While habit memory  associated with the attitude of the body can inhibit the realisation of spontaneous  memory, it is also encourages recognition within spontaneous memory because any  relaxation of the inhibition will encourage pure memories that fit into this attitude  (M.M., p.114); hence it is the sensory-motor apparatus that effectively materialises  memories.  In perception there is a moment of delay or hesitation between the brain  receiving and transmitting vibrations, thus providing an opportunity for the  transmission of automatic movements to be overridden, and for consciousness to  choose how to react; a choice that is made actual by the brain under the influence of  memory.  This requires an effort of consciousness to suppress immediate action and to  venture into the past in general to facilitate the recognition of memory images that  could fit into the present attitude of the body (M.M., p.114).  While Bergson refers to  the process of attentive recognition as an intellectual act of interpretation or reasoning  accompanied by a feeling of effort, it is helpful to remember, as Lawlor remarks, that  attentive recognition is Bergson’s method of intuition which he only develops in later  work (Lawlor, 2004, p.50).  Intuition is an act of sympathy that provides knowledge of  its object in terms of its internal vibration and which produces an affective disposition  or sense of meaning that facilitates the determination of differences in kind.  We find  an example of attentive recognition in Mind-Energy where he describes how some  chess players are able to play several games at once without looking at the boards.  </p><div id="pagenum"><p>276</p></div><p id="page">268   Bergson suggests that they mentally retain the power of the pieces as a “composition  of forces” and “remake the history of the game from the beginning” as “a reciprocal  penetration of all the elements” such that it is grasped “as a musician grasps a chord”   (‘Intellectual Effort’, in M.E., p.198).   Attentive recognition takes memory as a  heterogeneous composite of vibrations over time, which Bergson describes as a  “dynamic scheme” that is generated prior to the formation of the image (‘Intellectual  Effort’, in M.E., p.196), hence it is a formative idea that lacks extension or direction,  being only an “expectation of images” (‘Intellectual Effort’, in M.E., p.227).  While  inattentive recognition operates according to the law of similarity or sympathetic  resonance, attentive recognition operates according to the laws of similarity and  contiguity because its function is to consider the circumstances that preceded,  accompanied and followed a past situation in order to “understand the present and  anticipate the future”.  Bergson refers to association by similarity as the “means” of  achieving this while association by contiguity is the “end” (‘False Recognition’, in  M.E., p.176-177).  Therefore, as McNamara points out, we must not consider attentive  recognition to be purely the sympathetic resonance of individual qualities (McNamara,  1999, p.37), though this may occur.  While the memory must be acted by the body and  thought by the mind concurrently, the dynamic scheme must ‘harmonise’ with the  perception, rather than resonating with it in a precise form, though harmonisation is  ultimately dependent on resonance.  In ‘Dreams’, Bergson provides the example of  rapid reading, and suggests that we only perceive a few letters or words of a sentence  while the remainder is produced by the externalisation of memories, the meaning of  which appears to harmonise with the letters or words perceived (‘Dreams’, in M.E.,  pp.119-120).  Bergson proposes that pure memory consists of different “tones” or  planes of consciousness, such that in his illustration of the cone, those further down at </p><div id="pagenum"><p>277</p></div><p id="page">269   the point are closest to action while those at the base are more distant in the past,  having the nature of dream states (M.M., p.221).  Attentive recognition traverses the  different tones of consciousness and makes a series of attempts at synthesising  different memory images with the present perception.  While some are identical to the  present image and others resemble it, having a vague similarity, they all come forward  to meet it, one behind the other; however only images able to interpret the actual  perception insert themselves into it (M.M., p.125).  So, for example in the sentence  “…cat … on … mat”, attentive recognition will fill in the words to complete the  sentence: “The cat sat on the mat.”  Alternatives such as “The cat ate on the mat” or  “The cat slept on the mat” simply feel wrong and will be rejected.    Bergson claims the process of interpretation or reasoning is effectively a  contraction of memory and a “reconstruction” of the perception that occurs through  “reflexion” or “the projection, outside ourselves, of an actively created image, identical  with, or similar to, the object on which it comes to mould itself” (M.M., p.124).  The  memory image is therefore projected into the object rendering the whole process of  perception a circuit that starts and ends with the perceived object (M.M., p.127).  The  detail of the outlined object is filled in by capriciously selected repetitions through  deeper levels of memory of which each creates a new circuit that envelops the first.  This continues until memory “follows regularly, in all their details, the movements of  the body” (M.M., p.130). Hence:      to act is just to induce this memory to shrink, or rather to become thinned and  sharpened, so that it presents nothing thicker than the edge of a blade to actual  experience, into which it will thus be able to penetrate.  (M.M., p.130)   </p><div id="pagenum"><p>278</p></div><p id="page">270   Bergson states that the brain “serves to recall the recollection” and is “contrived”  to secure “adjustment to the situation” (‘The Soul and Body’, in M.E., p.65) using  organs of virtual perception:    there are … in that substance [of the brain], organs of virtual perception,  influenced by the intention of memory, as there are at the periphery organs of  real perception, influenced by the action of the object. (M.M., p.164)    He refers to these organs as an internal keyboard analogous to the external keyboard of  real perception; however, they both share the same set of strings or nervous system  which instigates movement of the body.  The stimulation of the internal keyboard is  therefore a prelude to a motor reaction.  As noted by Moulard-Leonard, Bergson’s account of reflexion in perception is a  further example of the pendulum or harmonic motion referred to in the Two Sources of  Morality and Religion,  and which is implicit in his philosophical method of intuition  and cosmology of Creative Evolution (Moulard-Leonard, 2008, pp.41-42).  While his  philosophical method of intuition in the generation of multiplicity in life was explained  in Chapter 5, its relevance to perception and kairos will be examined in more detail  later.  Figure 22 illustrates one circuit of the harmonic motion implicit in his account of  perception where the body occupies the centre.     Perception (Figure 22)        </p><div id="pagenum"><p>279</p></div><p id="page">271   Following the movement by starting with the body, the body isolates a material image  by reflecting on it, and in return the sense organs (the external keyboard) receive its  vibrations which travel via the nervous system to the brain.  Before sending the  appropriate vibrations through the spinal cord to stimulate physical movement of the  body as an impending action that outlines the object in space, memory condenses the  vibrations within its own duration and projects the whole of its content towards the  internal keyboard stimulating the process of reasoning or interpretation.  The brain only  allows a memory image (vibrations) through if it resonates or harmonises with the  present perception and is projected in an act of reflection onto the material image,  providing detail to the image.  The material image initially perceived is transformed as  the process is repeated as a series of hypotheses until the image is provided with  sufficient detail to integrate the memory thought with the memory acted.   Bergson  describes the process of intellectual effort as playing our thoughts externally, such that  the “play of ideas” receives a response from the “play of sensations…which is an echo  of it …in another tone”, and he states that: “these mental oscillations have their sensory  harmonics” (‘Intellectual Effort’, in M.E., p.222) which is illustrated in Figure 22  above.  The body or brain acts as a node in the harmonic motion of perception, a node  being a harmonic; the intersection of matter and memory is kairos in his theory of  perception.  Despite Bergson’s assertion that memory or consciousness implies freedom, one  may however question how much freedom an individual really has when operating  within a mechanistic model of harmonics.  This subject will therefore be addressed in  the following section.          </p><div id="pagenum"><p>280</p></div><p id="page">272   9.2   Bergson and Freedom        The aim of Time and Free Will  was to establish that when we conceive things as static  in space we think of free will as providing a choice between pre-existing alternatives;  however, the inner life is durational, and the future is invented as it progresses, hence a  self–determined future.  Bergson claims that freedom is a fact of experience and is not  a concept demanding an explanation because defining it gives rise to a paradox;  freedom becomes determined (T.F.W., p.220).  Lutzow comments:    Freedom offers Bergson the ground from which he can explain the existence of  other realities and at the same time criticize the scientific theories of his day.  Freedom and duration are facts of immediate experience. If these facts are  inadmissible to science, science must be faulted, not human experience. "We  cannot sacrifice experience to the requirements of a system" (CE 45). (Lutzow,  1977)    Bergson claims freedom is indefinable because it is an act and not a thing, and he  defines a free act as an outward manifestation of an inner state or a “relation between  the self and its action” (T.F.W., p.165); his theory of perception in Matter and Memory   establishes how this is achieved.   In Creative Evolution  Bergson refers to the creativity of God as unceasing life,  action, and freedom, and that we also are free when we create (C.E., p.245).  For  Bergson, freedom is associated with the creation of novelty in space and time, and the  durational process defines him as a philosopher of kairos:    The living being chooses or tends to choose. Its role is to create. In a world  where everything else is determined, a zone of indetermination surrounds it. To  create the future requires preparatory action in the present, to prepare what will  be is to utilize what has been: life therefore is employed from its start in  conserving the past and anticipating the future in a duration in which past, </p><div id="pagenum"><p>281</p></div><p id="page">273   present and future tread one on another, forming an indivisible continuity.  (‘Life and Consciousness’, in M.E., p.17)    While kairos is understood as perception, the synthesis of past, present and future,  for Bergson, it is also the moment when the brain actualises the freedom of the  perceiving subject by allowing the spontaneous memory to override the automatic  memory, and he concludes Matter and Memory  with the following statement:    Whether we consider it in time or in space, freedom always seems to have its  roots deep in necessity and to be intimately organised with it.  Spirit borrows  from matter the perceptions on which it feeds, and restores them to matter in the  form of movements which it has stamped with its own freedom. (M.M., p.332)    Bergson links freedom with necessity and Plotinus describes Intellect as the “principle  of necessity” ( Ennead V.3.6, 10-11) operating as a “law of being” ( Ennead V.9.5, 26- 29).  The One is the source of the substantial numbers in Being and Intellect (Ennead  V.1.5, 15-17) that arise from its radiation, and since these numbers are necessary for  freedom or ‘that which depends on us’, it is the means by which the One providentially  confers its freedom.  Similarly, Bergson’s God is essentially autonomous and confers  freedom onto us providentially, therefore overcoming the challenge that if we do what  God wills then we are not free.  Bergson claims that necessity in the process of evolution is intended to produce  the ultimate goal of freedom of action; however, this is determined by the degree of  consciousness of the organism.  It was explained in Chapter 6 that Bergson’s partial  finalism rests on the notion of the élan vital  as a supra-consciousness that is essentially  mind-like because it lacks consciousness in some of its manifestations.  It contains all  degrees of consciousness, including that pertaining to intellect, instinct and intuition, as  well as the sleeping consciousness of immobile vegetable matter and the latent </p><div id="pagenum"><p>282</p></div><p id="page">274   consciousness of unorganised matter.  For Bergson “consciousness is essentially free; it  is freedom itself” (C.E., p.270) because “to be awake means to will” (‘Memory of the  Present and False Recognition’, in M.E., p.155); however, he contends that the degree  of consciousness and freedom in organised matter varies with the complexity of the  nervous system:    Equally they measure, the one by the complexity of its structure and the other  by the intensity of its awareness, the quantity of choice that the living being has  at its disposal. (C.E., p 286)     Freedom to choose is also limited to a certain “order of greatness for condensation”  (‘Introduction II’, in C.M. p.59); hence Bergson contends “the body extracts from the  material environment whatever has been able to influence it” (‘Introduction II’, in C.M.  p.55) and this is determined by attunement:    Nothing would prevent other worlds, corresponding to another choice, from  existing with it, in the same place and the same time: in this way twenty  different broadcasting stations throw out simultaneously twenty different  concerts which coexist without any one of them mingling its sounds with the  music of another, each one being heard, complete and alone, in the apparatus  which has chosen for its reception the wavelength of that particular station.  (C.M., p.60)    Barnard refers to this as “Bergson’s radio reception theory of consciousness” (Barnard,  2011, p.237).  We only pick up on those durations or vibrations of matter to which we  are attuned; hence our perceptions are generally limited.  An insect and a human  perceive the world very differently because an insect perceives the colour spectrum at a  higher frequency than human perception, for example red light is invisible to insects;  however, they see ultraviolet light which is invisible to us; hence different worlds  simultaneously existing in the same place and time.  Because the body is limited by </p><div id="pagenum"><p>283</p></div><p id="page">275   what it can consciously extract from the material environment Bergson claims that  freedom is not in nature an “imperium in imperio” (M.M., p.331), that is, it is not an  independent feature or tendency that exists as an order within the whole.     Despite the natural limitations of freedom imposed on unorganised matter,  Bergson refers to living bodies as privileged “zones of indetermination” (M.M., p.23)  because they do not always react instantly to external influences in a determined way;  they are capable of novel actions in the surrounding matter.  Also, by placing matter  under the auspices of consciousness he can argue that matter is not necessarily  determined in the way science conceives it; hence the ability to account for  spontaneities in the evolution of life.  In Time and Free Will  Bergson claims man is free to the extent that he throws off  the shackles of the intellect that spatializes things and acknowledges:    It is the whole soul, in fact, which gives rise to the free decision, and the act will  be so much the freer the more the dynamic series with which it is connected  tends to be the fundamental self. (T.F.W., p.167)    We understand the fundamental self to be the durational spontaneous memory that  shapes our character, and which gives rise to the free decision , while the body gives rise  to the free act.  Bergson’s focus on the integration of mind and body in his notion of  freedom therefore differs from Plotinus who interprets freedom as “that which depends  on us”, which is “free from bodily affections” and dependent on the activities of  Intellect (Ennead VI.8.3, 19-23).  For Plotinus the goal is to be in Intellect at rest from  action because from here contemplation of the One is possible, and hence Bergson’s  criticism of Plotinus’ “incomplete” mysticism in The Two Sources of Morality and  Religion where he states that Plotinus:   </p><div id="pagenum"><p>284</p></div><p id="page">276   …did not get beyond this last stage, he did not reach the point where, as  contemplation is engulfed in action, the human will becomes one with the  divine will. (T.S.M.R., p.221)    For Bergson, it is action in the world that is paramount, action that transforms it and  furthers its evolution by participating in the creative freedom of God.  From his  perspective not only does Plotinus lack this goal because the body becomes  insignificant, but ascension to the One is not realised.  This leads us to an examination  of how kairos fits into Bergson’s account of freedom in The Two Sources of Morality  and Religion .  In The Two Sources of Morality and Religion  Bergson continues his philosophic  method of differentiation and integration by establishing two sources of morality and  their associated types of religion; closed morality and static religion is counterbalanced  by open morality and dynamic religion respectively.  Closed morality is dominated by  feelings of moral duty established within individual closed societies, and Bergson  refers to these feelings as customs or habits of social obligation that he likens to a  quasi-biological instinctive social necessity implicit in nature that resists change and  stifles individual freedom.  Despite this, Bergson claims that individuals feel  contentment, well-being and pleasure from their social obligations.  At the other  extreme is morality practised by Christian mystics who are open to humanity and the  world in general.  Both types of morality are driven by emotion; however, while closed  morality is infra-intellectual because its ideas generate emotions that “spur us on to acts  answering to needs”, open morality is supra-intellectual; it is emotion, and specifically  the emotion of love that produces ideas considered as “real inventions” (T.S.M.R.,  p.41).  The mystic acts as a role model for others and encourages transformation of self  and society in general, thus inducing a feeling of joy.  Bergson claims mystics are the  pinnacle of the evolutionary process of humanity because they are “capable of </p><div id="pagenum"><p>285</p></div><p id="page">277   transcending the limitations imposed on the species by its material nature” (T.S.M.R.,  p.220).  They can directly align themselves with the will of God or the élan vital,   participating in its absolute creative freedom, thus being “capable of transposing human  life into another tone” through their actions (T.S.M.R., p.99).  Bergson proposes that  the mystic possess a supra-intellectual quality of “supreme good sense”:     …there is an exceptional, deep-rooted mental healthiness, which is readily  recognizable. It is expressed in a bent for action, the faculty of adapting and re- adapting oneself to circumstances, in firmness combined with suppleness, in the  prophetic discernment of what is possible and what is not, in a spirit of  simplicity which triumphs over complications. (T.S.M.R., p.228)    Compare this with what Bergson says about good sense in Matter and Memory where  he refers to a man of impulse who lives in the present, responding to a stimulus by the  immediate reaction which prolongs it, while a dreamer lives in the past and his  memories become conscious without benefit to the present situation.  Neither of these  individuals is geared for action, whereas the man maintaining equilibrium between  these extremes is action-focused, possessing a “well-balanced mind” that employs  “good sense” in that he makes the right use of spontaneous memory:    Between these two extremes lies the happy disposition of a memory docile  enough to follow with precision all the outlines of the present situation, but  energetic enough to resist all other appeal. (M.M., p.198)    The notion of equilibrium is therefore important at the moment of kairos where  Bergson’s metaphor of the ‘blade’ mentioned in the quotation on p.269 marks the  distinction between memory and the movements of the body (M.M., p.130).  These </p><div id="pagenum"><p>286</p></div><p id="page">278   features are also found in the depiction of the mythical Kairos who holds scales  balanced on a razor.169    So, while the man of good sense in Matter and Memory  appeals to personal  memories to choose his action, the mystic appeals to the supra-conscious memory that  is the élan vital .  Both however engage harmonic motion in returning to the perceived  image and instigating action.  While in the moment of kairos the well-balanced mind  generates harmonics that are sensations, the supreme good sense of the mystic operates  in the moral domain where “Creation signifies, above all, emotion” (T.S.M.R., p.45),  and therefore generates harmonics as emotions when he reintegrates with closed  morality and static religion, effectively transforming it and facilitating the evolution of  humanity.  Bergson acknowledges that pure mysticism is rare (T.S.M.R., p.213) and the  freedom of ordinary individuals is limited; in fact, in Time and Free Will  he states:  “Many …live and die without having known true freedom” (T.F.W., p166).    Bergson does not refer to kairos explicitly and possible reasons for this will be  discussed in the Conclusion.170  He does however appear to follow the ancient Greeks  in adopting it as a generative and dynamic principle within his cosmology, theory of  perception, ethics, and it is implicit in his philosophical method of intuition.  While it is  commonly accepted that he used the mathematical calculus for its model, the following  section will examine how Bergson’s method of intuition may also have been inspired  by kairos in ancient Greek rhetoric under the influence of the Pythagorean tradition.                                                                             169  Chapter 7.1, p.212.  170  Conclusion, pp.307-308. </p><div id="pagenum"><p>287</p></div><p id="page">279   9.3   Kairos in Bergson’s Philosophical Method        In the ‘Introduction to Metaphysics’ Bergson argues most of the unresolved  philosophical problems remain unresolved because metaphysics has adopted the   intellectual method used by science studying nature systematically and analytically, and  that views reality as absolutely mechanistic; hence he proposes metaphysics requires a  method of intuition to capture reality as duration in its indivisible dynamic creative  activity.  Deleuze describes Bergson’s method of intuition as follows:    Intuition is neither a feeling, an inspiration, nor a disorderly sympathy, but a fully  developed method, one of the most developed methods in Philosophy. (Deleuze,  1991, p.13)    It is commonly accepted that Bergson refers to mathematics as a model of his  philosophic method and it was suggested in Chapter 6 that the 3-stage generative  structure of Pythagorean cosmology is more appropriate; however, it is also implicated  in the notion of kairos in the rhetoric of ancient Greece.  It is a model with which  Bergson was well acquainted, as his friend, Jacques Chevalier, informs us that Bergson  “was also a finished humanist, to whom was awarded, at the Concours Général , the  "Honors Prize" in rhetoric as well as in mathematics” (Chevalier, 1928, p.43).  The  influence of rhetoric and kairos appears to be a subject that has been neglected by  Bergson scholars; however, it will be proposed that Bergson’s philosophical method,  and hence his cosmology, is a rhetorical operation that connects Bergson with kairos  and the Pythagorean tradition, as was explained in Chapter 7.  Bergson’s skill in the art of rhetoric implies that he would have been familiar  with the five canons of the Rhetorica ad Herennium (86-82 B.C.) that include  Invention, Arrangement, Style, Memory and Delivery, and which still form the basis of </p><div id="pagenum"><p>288</p></div><p id="page">280   method in modern rhetoric, the purpose of which is to resolve conflicts of knowledge.   While its author is unknown, Enos refers to it as “the earliest and most complete  manual of Roman rhetoric” that “synthezises Greek rhetoric into Roman education”  (Enos, 2005, p.336); the Rhetorica ad Herennium therefore has its roots in ancient  Greek rhetoric.    Carter argues that the earlier concept of  kairos, the principle employed by  Gorgias and the earlier Sophists, became immersed in the concept of  stasis, a formal  theory proposed by Hermagoras around 150 B.C., and which later became central to the  notion of invention in the Rhetorica (Carter, 1988, pp.97-112) .  He notes striking  similarities between kairos and stasis, the key points of which are summarised and  compared to Bergson’s method.    Kairos and stasis adopt the role of “opposing forces” or arguments.    As explained in Chapter 7, the Sophists, under the influence of a Pythagorean  philosophy based on  harmonia or the integration of opposites, aimed to resolve the  intransigence arising from opposing concepts or arguments  (dissoi logoi ), considered  foundational for the art of rhetoric.  We only have to consider the titles of Bergson’s  books and subjects he examined to find a similar point of departure: space/time,  determinism/freedom, matter/memory, intellect/intuition, static/dynamic religion and  morality, realism/idealism, possible/real, order/disorder, and being/nothing.    Kairos and stasis “act as an invitation to, and indeed even allow for, rhetorical  action.”    Rhetorical action must be understood as a generative or transformational act  of  resolving the conflict between opposites and providing a sound decision.  This is </p><div id="pagenum"><p>289</p></div><p id="page">281   achieved by the first canon of the Rhetorica,  ‘Invention’, the function of which is  described by Lauer as “supplying ideas, subject matter, and arguments to flesh out the  introduction, the statement of facts and the proof or the refutation for judicial,  deliberative, and epideictic discourse.” (Lauer & Pender, 2003, p.52).  Sloane  comments in his Encyclopedia of Rhetoric :    …while English distinguishes between invention, which brings into existence  something new, and discovery , which finds what is already there, both Latin  and Greek use the same word, inventio or heurein, for both. (Sloane, 2001,  p.389)     ‘Invention’ in rhetoric therefore includes both the creation of something new and  discovery of what already exists in terms of providing evidence on which to form an  argument.  ‘Invention’ is a dynamic concept starting with commonly accepted facts and  moving to a new perspective; it therefore encompasses the whole of the rhetorical  argument from start to finish.  For Bergson, invention is the key aim of his  philosophical method, the first rule of which Deleuze defines as, “Apply the test of true  and false to problems themselves. Condemn false problems and reconcile truth and  creation at the level of problems” (Deleuze, 1991, p.15).  This is because Bergson  claims philosophical problems remain unresolved due to an intractable contradiction of  opposites caused by a lack of precision in specifying them (‘Introduction II’ in, C.M.,  p.77), and that the solution for any philosophical problem will always be found  providing the problem is precisely specified; “it is a question of finding the problem  and hence of posing it even more than of solving it.  For a speculative problem is  solved as soon as it is well posed” (‘Introduction II’, in C.M., p.51).  In a letter to Floris  Delattre, (1935) he writes:   </p><div id="pagenum"><p>290</p></div><p id="page">282   …philosophizing for real should mean at once creating the position of a  problem and creating the solution. … I consider an amateur the one who  chooses between ready-made solutions, as one decides to register as a member  of this or that political party. But I consider a philosopher the one who creates  the necessarily unique solution of the problem which he has posed anew by the  very effort of trying to solve it. ( Melanges , p.1528)    While Bergson rejects the notion of discovery in favour of invention in his method, he  suggests this work of discovery or preparatory study is essential for analysing a  problem in its elements.  The method he proposes “demands that [a philosopher] be  ready, no matter what his age, to become a student once more” (‘Introduction II’ in,  C.M., pp.67-68).  Thus, he conducts analyses of philosophical, scientific, and other  empirical evidence to support his arguments, which is, on his terms, an act of discovery  of what already exists (‘Introduction II’, in C.M., p.51).  The philosophical method that  Bergson employs therefore includes discovery and invention, the constituents of  ‘invention’ in rhetoric.    Kairos and stasis both “serve as guides to resolving the initiating conflict through a  judgment.    The formation of a judgement occurs in the act of invention, and Carter notes that  judgements were "non-rational" in the case of kairos and “rational” in the case of  stasis, where decisions were based on a formal four-part invention process in which  questions were asked to determine the facts, nature and seriousness of an issue, and a  plan of action.  Bergson adopts a method of questioning in his texts; however, a much  deeper analysis would be necessary to discover whether his questioning follows the  systematic character of stasis.  The emphasis Bergson places on intuition in his  philosophical method suggests it more closely resembles the non-rational method  employed by Gorgias who adopted the notion of kairos.  Gorgias, a rhetorician and </p><div id="pagenum"><p>291</p></div><p id="page">283   philosopher, held the view that rhetoric could rarely provide objective truth through  reasoning because words distort reality.  Heidlebaugh suggests that for the Sophists,  and for Gorgias in particular, kairos promotes active artistic judgement through an act  of intuition:    In attempting to teach Rhetoric … Gorgias suggested a technê in which subject  and object merge in response to the dictates of a powerful moment.  The power  and novelty of the moment are such that habitual thinking like that in the  methods useful to everyday craftsmanship are inadequate for meeting the  moment.  A technê grounded in “radical occasionality” must assist in disrupting  the methods of routine production, in muting or concealing the habitual, and  thus allow for the craftsperson to respond directly to the moment, to see it  freshly.  (Heidlebaugh, 2001, p.47)    It is suggested that Gorgias considered reality as a Heraclitean becoming  in which the  moment of kairos was grasped by intuition (White, 1987, pp.16,34) and succeeded by  rational reflection.  White refers to Gorgianic kairos as the “irrational novelty of the  moment that escapes formalisation” (White, 1987, p.20); however it was a method of  intuition that originated with the senses, thus having an aesthetic component  (Untersteiner, 1954, pp.185-194), leading commentators to classify him as an  empiricist (Consigny, 2001, p.27).  Rhetoric was therefore intuitive in the sense that the  rhetorician had to read the energy of the time, place, the audience, and be aware of the  assumptions they make, the present and historical arguments as well as understanding  the relevant facts.  Once again, we find echoes of this interpretation of Gorgias in  Bergson who proposed a “true empiricism” and for whom judgement formed by  intuition is the source of philosophical knowledge (‘Introduction to Metaphysics’ in,  C.M., p.175).  Like Gorgias, he proposes in Creative Evolution :   </p><div id="pagenum"><p>292</p></div><p id="page">284   The duty of philosophy should be to examine … the living without any  reservation as to practical utility, by freeing itself from forms and habits that are  strictly intellectual.  Its own special object is to speculate, that is to see. (C.E.,  p.196)    For Bergson, intuition is an intellectual act that choses to observe itself internally, that  is to think in duration, an act that requires us to reverse the direction of habitual  patterns of thought, i.e. to the external world.  It is an act that relies on the concept of  sympathy in which the act of perception or sensing (sentir) provides immediate  knowledge of its object in terms of its rhythms, vibrations or power, by becoming one  with it; hence an example of good sense.  As a conscious act that produces knowledge  from internal observation, intuition is the experience of self-sympathy, because, as  Bergson proposes, we can ‘sympathise with ourselves’ and nothing else (‘Introduction  to Metaphysics’, in C.M., p.162-3).  Lawlor explains that human intuition ‘is a  particularly difficult way of sensing’ which means harmonising the senses.  He notes  that Bergson considers intuition in terms of sense of touch and hearing, as well as  vision.  There is ‘contact’ or ‘coincidence’ as well as ‘spiritual auscultation’:     In the Introduction to Metaphysics  Bergson describes intuition: ….to penetrate  the self, and through a kind of spiritual auscultation, to sense its soul palpitate.  Auscultation is a technical term in medicine meaning to listen attentively to  organs either by the ear directly or by means of an artifice like a stethoscope  …when one auscultates, one must really listen ... The image of the ausculator  tells us that Bergsonian intuition is like a doctor’s intuition, an intense intuition  in which one recognises differences and continuities. (Lawlor, 2004, p.65)    Intuition is therefore not pure thinking or idea; it is an immediate experience that  implies sensibility arising within consciousness that facilitates the determination of  differences in kind.  Intuition enables us to become aware that false problems arise  because of badly analysed composites; we fail to distinguish differences in kind, </p><div id="pagenum"><p>293</p></div><p id="page">285   mistaking them for differences of degree, hence the second rule of method that Deleuze  attributes to Bergson is “Struggle against illusion, rediscover the true differences in  kind or articulations of the real” (Deleuze, 1991, p.21).  This is achieved by making  qualitative distinctions between opposites that Bergson considers in terms of static and  dynamic tendencies.   Thinking for Bergson is:    essentially a continuous change of internal direction, with a tendency to  translate itself into changes of external directions, I mean to say, into actions or  gestures able to draw in space and express metaphorically the comings and  goings of mind. (‘The Soul and the Body’, in M.E., p.56)     Therefore, as Frédéric Worms notes, thinking “is a process of mediation between pure  intuition and pure intelligence …We have to live and think in the double movement of  concentrating and expressing” (Worms, 2005, p.1233).  While the intellect expresses  itself externally and spatially, for Bergson the intuition of duration “fits none of our  categories of thought” (‘Introduction II’, in C.M., p.34) because the intuition can only  be communicated or expressed by means of the intelligence, whose language fails to  capture its dynamic nature (‘Introduction II’, in C.M., p.42):    We call intuition the sympathy by which one is transported into the interior of  an object in order to coincide with what there is unique and consequently  inexpressible in it. (‘Introduction to Metaphysics’, in C.M., p.161)    While their underlying arguments differ, Bergson follows Gorgias in proposing a  theory of intuition in which judgements formed by sensibility only produce knowledge  considered as approximate when expressed in language.  This brings us to Carter’s  fourth similarity between kairos and stasis.    </p><div id="pagenum"><p>294</p></div><p id="page">286   Both offered systems of questioning which generated probable knowledge from a  synthesis of the opposing arguments.     As noted above, the earlier Sophists synthesised the opposites in a kairic act of  intuition, as does Bergson, who endeavours to overcome the contradiction of his static  and dynamic concepts with an ontological shift that refers to them as tendencies rather  than discrete objects or states, as shown in the table below.    Static Dynamic  Intellect Instinct/Intuition  Space Time  Matter Memory  Closed Morality Open Morality  Closed Religion Open Religion    In each case he integrates the opposites by an act of intuition that enables a question to be  posed in terms of duration or consciousness; hence, as revealed by the harmonics model,  the differences in kind become differences of degree; the dualism becomes a monism.  While the generative process for both Plotinus and Bergson begins with an  undifferentiated First Principle whose radiation or élan vital respectively, takes the form  of an undifferentiated dualism as potentialities, it could be argued that Plotinus’ dualisms  of motion and rest, same and other, and Bergson’s dualism of matter and memory, take  the form of unlimited and limiting, thus following the lead of the Pythagorean  Philolaus.171    For the earlier Sophists employing kairos, and with the later concept of stasis,  knowledge was not considered absolute but probable.  Rhetoric did not aim at absolute                                                                171 Chapter 2.1, p.33; Chapter 2.1.2, p.35. </p><div id="pagenum"><p>295</p></div><p id="page">287   knowledge; rhetorical kairos especially, was regarded as process, that is, a forward and  backward movement between the intuition of the rhetorician and its expression in  language, and which encompassed the process of asking questions, considering  evidence, creating ideas and building arguments, with the aim of deciding the right  action and in the right measure appropriate to the circumstance.  Sometimes it resulted  in a choice between the opposite arguments posed, and sometimes a synthesis of both.   Similarly, we find that for Bergson, his method of philosophy is an act, a dynamic  movement between intuition and intelligence which progresses towards knowledge,  thus leaving scope for further progress.  Philosophy does not find immediate certainty;  it is:    …a gradual ascent into light.  Borne along in an experience growing ever wider  and wider, rising to ever higher and higher probabilities, it would strive towards  final certainty as to a limit. (M.E., p.6)    But as with everything durational, his philosophical method was essentially open-ended  because the whole is constantly changing.  Closely linked to the probability of  knowledge is Carter’s final comparison of kairos and stasis.    Both are concerned with the rhetorical situation in terms of opportune moment and  appropriateness of speech .      This concerns the rhetorical context and arguments that are appropriate to a rhetorical  issue that is situation specific.  Similarly, Bergson insists that we cannot reason  mathematically about problems; they cannot be constructed hypothetically from general  notions stored up in language, and each new problem demands a new effort of intuition  that considers all the relevant facts available at the time.  Gorgias in his  ‘On Nature’ or  ‘On Not-Being’, and Bergson (C.M., p.162) refer to language as only providing a </p><div id="pagenum"><p>296</p></div><p id="page">288   symbolic representation of reality; however both require that invention employs  creativity in using language.  The notion of creativity encompasses invention, or what  is said, as well as the style, or how it is said.  ‘Style’ is the subject of the third canon of  the Rhetorica ad Herennium.  Gorgias is described as:     …using a language enriched by the exuberance of a poetical imagination. He  was much addicted to the substitution of rare expressions—γλῶτται, as the  Greek critics called them —for the ordinary forms of speech. His language  abounded in archaic and poetical words, striking metaphors and unusual  compounds. (Dobson, 1919)     Bergson’s use of language is described by Gunn in similar terms:    Bergson’s style of writing merits high praise. …he is highly imaginative and  picturesque… at times he rises to a high pitch of feeling and oratory. … There  is in his works a beauty of style and a comparative absence of technical terms  which have contributed much to his popularity.  The criticism directed against  his poetic style accuses him of hypnotising us by his fine language, of  employing metaphors where we expect facts, and of substituting illustrations for  proofs. (Gunn, 1920, pp.103-104)    The analysis of the principles of kairos and stasis in rhetoric and in Bergson’s  philosophical method suggests that while it is uncertain whether Bergson employs the  act of systematic questioning used in stasis, he appears to adopt the intuitive notion of  kairos and the style of Gorgias.  The similarities between them can be summarised as  follows: a reality informed by opposites; an opportune moment of intuition that must  but cannot be adequately expressed in language; the acts of invention, discovery of  facts, and judgment that provides probable knowledge that progressively approaches  certainty or resolution of a conflict using highly creative language and imaginative  metaphors described as ‘poetic’; and the commitment to appropriate action.    </p><div id="pagenum"><p>297</p></div><p id="page">289   The link between rhetoric and kairos therefore appears to be more compatible  with Bergson’s philosophy than the mathematical model that he suggests.  Once again,  the Pythagorean connection is apparent because Bergson’s philosophical method  closely follows the rhetoric of Gorgias who was influenced by the Pythagorean  understanding of kairos through his teacher Empedocles.           Conclusion        Bergson has been argued to be a philosopher of kairicity and the examination of its  application to his theories of perception, ethics, freedom and his philosophical method  of intuition has revealed that it is implicit within his philosophy founded on the model  of the generation of harmonics.  The integration of the static and dynamic opposites is  only possible because the élan vital  generated matter and consciousness as a series of  harmonics, and the creative process is continued as more harmonics are generated at the  moment of kairos, the point at which they coincide.  The kairos of perception, the  coincidence of matter and memory, is a node of sensation; the kairos of morality, the  coincidence of the closed and open, is a node of emotion;  and the kairos of  philosophical intuition, the coincidence of intelligence and intuition, is a node of  knowledge or understanding.  Each moment of kairos presents the opportunity for the  expression of freedom.  While this freedom is not absolute other than in the rare case of  the mystic, freedom exists in degrees, leaving it open to evolve as the harmonic motion  continues its course.  Bergson alludes to the mythological depiction of Kairos in  ancient Greece in his description of duration as the hyphen or bridge that connects the  past and future, and he appears to have adopted kairos as employed in the rhetoric of  ancient Greece in his philosophical method.  The link that connects a philosophy of </p><div id="pagenum"><p>298</p></div><p id="page">290   harmonics with a philosophy of kairicity is the Pythagorean tradition, an influence that  appears more than coincidental in Bergson’s work.                                                 </p><div id="pagenum"><p>299</p></div><p id="page">291   Conclusion    *      Mossé-Bastide’s Bergson et Plotin  surprisingly, remains the only work that  comprehensively studies the key concepts shared by Plotinus and Bergson, as well as  their differences.  She notes that the significant resemblances between them include: a  presentation of metaphysics as psychological experience that requires a special kind of  consciousness that dispenses with images, and is one in which subject and object are  united; secondly, a shared conception of causality in which multiplicity emerges from a  prior cause and which is a continual process of change; and thirdly, the way in which  salvation is offered to man by the dialectic of love and the inner experience of freedom.  However, she points out that the shared concept of logos that is implicit in the  generation of multiplicity is of prime significance (Mossé-Bastide, pp.397-402). This  study has aimed to build on theses shared concepts and to add another dimension to the  relationship, by arguing that they both present a philosophy modelled on the dual and  interlinked concepts of harmonics and kairos that have their roots in the Pythagorean  tradition.  Apart from the French literature linking kairos to Bergson and Plotinus in  very general terms, the subject of harmonics and its related Pythagorean influence has  not previously been addressed, therefore there is little secondary literature to either  support or refute the arguments presented.  The following summary reviews each of the  chapters, focusing on aspects of the texts scholars have found challenging, and how the  new interpretation resolves the perceived difficulties.  In addition, it will highlight  important new revelations and opportunities for further work.    To provide context for the following chapters, Chapter One  examined how  Bergson and Plotinus could have been influenced by Pythagoreanism in their respective </p><div id="pagenum"><p>300</p></div><p id="page">292   eras, and it was found that both philosophers lived in eras when Pythagoreanism was  experiencing a revival.  Plotinus was subject to the influence of Pythagoreanism  through Plato, the Neo-Pythagoreans of his era, his teacher Ammonius Saccas, his own  study of ancient philosophy, as well as its prevalence in the wider culture.  He adopted  an ascetic lifestyle, and like the Pythagoreans, treated philosophy as an initiation into  higher knowledge.   It was more important to establish the Pythagorean background for Bergson as  neither he nor anyone else has acknowledged their influence on him; however, it was  shown that in Bergson’s era scientific and mathematical developments coincided with a  revival of Pythagoreanism in the wider culture, and these developments, as well as the  philosophy of Plotinus, complemented his interest in French Spiritualism as advocated  by Maine de Biran and Ravaisson.  It was proposed that Bergson encountered  Pythagoreanism through his family, his study of mathematics and rhetoric, the  influence of Theosophy, and through his lectures on Greek philosophy, including the  Pythagoreans and Plotinus, influences that possibly contributed to his interest in  esotericism and psychical research.  It was noted that while Bergson did not adopt an  ascetic lifestyle, it appears that he intentionally continued the ancient tradition of  regarding philosophy as an initiation; hence there are noticeable similarities with  Plotinus and the Pythagorean approach to philosophy in terms of content and style.    The aim of Chapter Two was to examine the generation of multiplicity from the  perspective of Pythagorean cosmogony and cosmology and to introduce key concepts  Plotinus and Bergson employ in their respective philosophies: nature, the principles of  limiting and the unlimited, harmonia  (ἁρμονία), and the function of the Pythagorean  Monad in their number theory .  This was followed by a brief history of Pythagorean  harmonics and number theory, and a basic introduction to the Pythagorean science of </p><div id="pagenum"><p>301</p></div><p id="page">293   harmonics.  It was proposed that Plotinus and Bergson would have conceived  Pythagorean numbers as powers.   The generation of multiplicity in Intellect has proved challenging for scholars of  the Enneads, and Chapter Three argued that the model of the generation of harmonics  is buried in the text, thus suggesting the Pythagorean influence on Plotinus is greater  than previously realised.  It is significant that the model of harmonics and the  Pythagorean influence explain several concepts not fully understood by Plotinian  scholars, for example, why procession and reversion is necessary for the generation of  Intellect and the multiplicity within it; the nature and shape of the forms; the nature of  logos as substantial number and form; how number relates to the primary kinds and  generates the Beings in Intellect; and finally, it explains the nature of the Plotinian  decad.  While it could be objected that the physics of standing waves and harmonics  were not understood in Plotinus’ day, it was noted that the Stoics, Vitruvius (1st century  B.C.), as well as Boethius (A.D. 480-524) considered sound a transverse wave and that  Nichomachus (c. 60-120 A.D.) specifically refers to the inverse proportion obtaining  between the length of string on a canon and its vibration when the string is plucked.  It  suggests that Plotinus understood that the correspondence of physical distance and  musical ratios could be determined in terms of vibrations, a theory he applied non- spatially to Intellect.  If this interpretation is correct it is an important and previously  unrecognised development of Pythagorean philosophy.   Chapter Four examined Plotinus’ account of the generation of Soul and the origin  and nature of matter, suggesting that the harmonics model and Pythagorean influence is  operational at every stage in the procession from the One.  Once again it was argued  that the harmonics model resolves difficulties perceived by commentators.  It clarifies  the various levels of Soul, challenges the view that the Hypostasis Soul  is a rational </p><div id="pagenum"><p>302</p></div><p id="page">294   form, explains how Plotinus could conceive of the  World Soul  as the eldest, and how  each primary Soul form generates its own offspring as an infinite series, one after  another in temporal succession as in a musical scale or melody.  Plotinus’ account of the generation of the world and its contents by the World  Soul employs the concepts of attunement, correspondence and conflict, which it was  argued can be understood as constructive or destructive interference in physics; hence  new ‘nodes’ and forms are generated that do not receive their rational forming  principles from Intellect.  Individual souls are fitted into bodies according to  providence facilitating attunement and sympathy, which is akin to the Pythagorean  concept of harmonia .  While Pythagorean harmonics underpins the ontological  structure that facilitates sympathy in Plotinus’ metaphysics, it was speculated that  Aristoxenus influenced his epistemology with the concept of synesis, an a priori innate  musical intuition.  The harmonics model is more obvious in Plotinus’ account of Soul,  and it was argued that the commonly held view that Plotinus’ concept of sympathia  has  Stoic origins requires re-evaluation because the Pythagorean influence is more  compatible with his account.   It was suggested that disagreement amongst scholars concerning the role of music  and musical metaphors in the Enneads arise because they have not grasped how  harmonics are generated in Intellect.  It was therefore proposed that the Pythagorean  influence on Plotinus has been misunderstood and underemphasised in his theory of  Soul.   The ambiguity concerning the nature and origin of physical matter in the Enneads  has again resulted in differences of interpretation among commentators.  It was argued  that the harmonics model accounts for why physical matter does not exist in Being but  is necessary for the making of the universe and conforms to Plotinus’ assertion that </p><div id="pagenum"><p>303</p></div><p id="page">295   matter is “a sort of form” and must therefore have its origin in Intellect.  It was  suggested that matter is a form in as much as it is generated as a flat line, formed when  the distance between the nodes or harmonics generated from the fundamental as an  infinite series approaches zero.  It therefore acts as a powerless but reflective surface  for the forms, just as matter acts as a reflective surface onto which sound waves are  projected to produce sound that is perceived.    The model of harmonics it is not completely hidden in the Enneads, neither is it  obvious, and it was noted that Plotinus is more explicit about harmonic principles when  describing the nature of Soul, but never explicitly refers to it in the generation and  nature of Being, Intellect  and matter.  It was concluded that Plotinus’ account of Soul  supports the argument that the harmonics model applies to Intellect and matter, because  aporias remain in his philosophy without it.    Plotinus’ lack of clarity has been the cause of vagueness, misunderstanding and  debate amongst those attempting to understand various concepts in the Enneads, and it  all appears to originate from the ambiguity linked to the generation of multiplicity in  Intellect; in particular the lack of explanation about the mechanism of procession and  reversion and the nature of logos.  An appreciation of the importance of the science of  harmonics and the Pythagorean influence on Plotinus could transform our  understanding of the Enneads.   Chapter Five commenced the exploration of the Pythagorean influence on  Bergson with an examination of the role of God and the élan vital  in his cosmology as  described in Creative Evolution .  It was concluded that while Bergson strongly rejected  the notion of pantheism he followed the Pythagoreans and Plotinus who could be more  accurately placed in the category of panentheism , because, in the latter theory, God  remains distinct from its products but is active within them.  </p><div id="pagenum"><p>304</p></div><p id="page">296   It was noted that commentators have failed to grasp the significance of the  impulsion and inversion of the élan vital in Bergson’s cosmology as proposed in  Creative Evolution.  This is surprising because Bergson always considered duration as  vibrations of energy, and one plausible interpretation is that vibrations are formed by  harmonic motion.  It was therefore argued that Bergson followed Plotinus in adopting  harmonic motion as the mechanism of his method of philosophical intuition and  therefore the élan vital .  The élan vital generates itself ‘fanwise’, firstly as a single  vibration or ‘fundamental’, and matter and consciousness as harmonics, or two separate  tendencies that each generate their own harmonics, forming a supra-conscious memory  analogous to Plotinus’ Intellect, while Plotinus’s Soul becomes Bergson’s intellect  whose function is to spatialize matter.  Despite the similarities, Plotinus hypostasises  Intellect as eternity and Soul as its temporal expression, whereas Bergson synthesises  them, so his ontological and epistemological structure is a wholly temporal process.  It  was therefore concluded that the model of harmonics solves the ‘mystery’ of Bergson’s  cosmology and explains the durational nature of consciousness and matter.    In Chapter Six the examination of Bergson’s arguments for partial finalism, his  theory of number, the influence of mathematics, and his sympathy with a Pythagorean  philosophy of transformation supported the arguments made in Chapter Five and  developed the argument for a Pythagorean influence on him.  It was proposed that  Bergson’s arguments for partial finalism revealed that he followed Plotinus in adopting  the 3-stage generative structure of Pythagorean cosmology.  Furthermore, he adopts  key Pythagorean themes with his analogy of microcosm and macrocosm, his theory of  attunement between and intellect and matter, the sympathy of instinct and intuition with  matter, as well as his notion of conflict and war, which can be understood as destructive  interference.  All these concepts are consistent with the model of harmonics.  It was </p><div id="pagenum"><p>305</p></div><p id="page">297   argued that the harmonics model is compatible with his account of how consciousness  and matter are integrated in the whole to create organic life, and how he includes  spontaneity and freedom within his account of partial finalism.  It also accounts for  similarities in structure in the evolutionary process due to the proportional existence of  tendencies within matter and organic life and is consistent with the musical theme   Bergson proposes.    While Bergson does not discuss number as having a specific role in the generation  of multiplicity, in Creative Evolution  he acknowledges that he is following Plotinus’  theory of logos, thus distinguishing between monadic number or quantitative  multiplicity and substantial number or qualitative multiplicity, the latter being generated  with the generation of multiplicity as nodes and vibrations.  Bergson makes a clear distinction between the geometrical order and the vital  order and insists that mathematics cannot account for duration because it does not  concern itself with the intervals between the static points on which it bases its  calculations.  It was argued that Deleuze was mistaken to have considered Riemann’s  conceptual spatial mathematics to have influenced Bergson to the degree that he  suggests due to the temporal nature of duration.  Furthermore, it was proposed that the  influence of modern calculus on his philosophical method has been understandably  overemphasised.  It was suggested that the calculus Bergson had in mind produced a  “fan-wise” generation of multiplicity in the form of the Pythagorean tetractys, which  was also adopted by Plotinus; hence the mathematics underpinning Bergson’s  qualitative differentiations and integrations is not the mathematics of science, but  music; the significance of which is that it takes account of the intervals in which kairos  represents a harmonic,  as explained in Chapter 9.  </p><div id="pagenum"><p>306</p></div><p id="page">298   The argument for a Pythagorean influence on Bergson was supported by an  examination of his lectures, which revealed his sympathy for their number theory and  philosophy of transformation, which is not surprising since his own philosophy is an  open system of dynamic transformation.  It was therefore proposed that while commentators have noted a similarity of  Bergson’s ‘creative evolution’ with Pythagorean cosmology, it was a mistake to have  dismissed it, as was dismissing his musical references as mere metaphor.  It was noted  that Bergson specifically links the generation of novelty to harmonics in several places  in his work and that he replicates arguments made by Aristoxenus, an ancient Greek  theorist of experiential harmonics who was linked to the Pythagoreans.  It was also  noted that Bergson makes several references to Pythagoras or Pythagoreanism that  indicate a possible influence.    This new interpretation of Bergson’s metaphysics not only clarifies his  cosmology but potentially touches many aspects of his philosophy that may be read in a  new light from the perspective of the influence of Plotinus and the Pythagoreans.    Chapter Seven introduced the concept of kairos that has already been  acknowledged as significant to the philosophy of Plotinus and Bergson, though it has  been largely neglected in the English language literature.  In ancient Greece kairos  differed from c hronos or chronological time in that it was understood as time  considered to be dynamic and purely subjective, hence not measurable, uniform, or  absolutely predictable.  It was understood as the interval that links the past to the future,  requiring human participation in the act of creation and signifying the emergence of  qualitative change that is situation specific.  Kairos was prevalent in Greek drama,  medicine, as well as being important in Pythagorean cosmology and ethics, which in  turn influenced the rhetoric of Gorgias and Isocrates.  It was proposed that Plotinus and </p><div id="pagenum"><p>307</p></div><p id="page">299   Bergson adopt kairos as a poietic moment, applying the Pythagorean notions of  opposites and harmonia  to their concepts of mind and matter, freedom and  determinacy, concepts that integrate to facilitate action.  Chapter Eight examined the concept of kairos in the Enneads, with reference to  the World Soul  in its making of the world, and individual souls in their interaction with  the world, clarifying how it is linked to the model of harmonics.  It was explained how  the World Soul  makes the world as an act of contemplation that is paradoxical because  it is an act that is concurrently necessary as an act of providence and free.  While the  World Soul contemplates the harmonics or substantial numbers and forms in Intellect,  analysis of Plotinus’ definition of freedom or ἐφ’ ἡμῖν, meaning ‘that which depends on  us’, revealed that the World Soul  fulfils one of the requirements for freedom because it  is not under outside influence, what it makes is within its power, and its knowledge is  right knowledge or wisdom because it contemplates the forms in Intellect, which are  Beings of eternal truth.  An examination of Plotinus’ account of the psychology of individual souls  included his theories of sense perception, memory, reason, and freedom.  In sense  perception, Plotinus considers sensation arising from the stimulation of sense organs of  the body and perception as conscious awareness of external objects as other than itself.   It was noted that commentators have experienced difficulties in comprehending  Plotinus’ concepts of ‘impressions’, ‘assimilation’ and ‘resemblance’ and how they are  related to sympathia .  It was argued that once again difficulties arise because they  assume Plotinus’ sympathia  to have a Stoic origin, and that they are resolved if  sympathia  is understood from a Pythagorean perspective because the harmonics model  underpins Plotinus’ theory that facilitates the interaction between body and soul.  This  is important because sympathia  is also relevant in his theory of memory, reason and </p><div id="pagenum"><p>308</p></div><p id="page">300   ultimately human freedom.  It was explained that in sense perception the soul is able to  receive the impressions of sense objects through the body because there is a  correspondence or attunement between them, made possible because each soul  possesses all the logoi in itself, but only as an imitation of those in Intellect, as are  those in sense objects and the sense organs.  It was proposed that ‘impressions’ can be  understood as forms or vibrations, where one form resonates to the vibrations of  another; ‘assimilation’ arises when two bodies possess the same harmonic  linked to the  frequency of the vibrations; and sympathia  can be understood as sympathetic  resonance, in which the passive affection of an object by another object at a distance  from it leaves the passive recipient unchanged.  It was suggested that this interpretation  is consistent with an alternative form of perceptual realism in which external objects  are forms in matter considered as imitations, not ‘images’, of the forms in Intellect.   This new interpretation of the role of sympathia  in sense perception warrants further  investigation due to the limited scope of the analysis presented here.    While Plotinus’ account of memory presents less difficulty in the secondary  literature, commentators have debated the role of λογιξόμενον and διανοητικόν, two  terms that Plotinus uses for the activities of the reasoning soul.  While commentators  usually interpret them as both meaning ‘discursive reasoning’ as thinking in words or  images produced by the imaging power of the soul, it was argued, based on the new  interpretation of logos in Chapter 3 as substantial number and form, that Plotinus is  referring to two different activities of the reasoning soul.  λογιζόμενον uses  sympathetic resonance and accounts for the ability of the reasoning power to make its  judgement about the perceived object in terms of harmonics (substantial numbers) and  forms (vibrations), that act as measures used in the judgement.  This is followed by  διανοητικόν interpreted as ‘discursive reasoning’ or thinking in words or spatial </p><div id="pagenum"><p>309</p></div><p id="page">301   images.  It was noted that λογιζόμενον is also highly relevant to Plotinus’ account of  virtue that he acknowledges to originate with “the ancients”, and who are understood to  be the Pythagoreans, for whom logismos is a rational calculation where opposites are  fitted together ( harmonia ) using ratios to provide knowledge and understanding about  the world, as well as forming the basis of ethical action.  While the examination of  these two terms was limited in scope and the interpretation speculative, further in-depth  analysis of how Plotinus uses διανοητικόν and λογιζόμενον in the Enneads is warranted  as it could be important for those commenting on Plotinus’ psychology, or for anyone  undertaking a translation of the Enneads.   The examination of human freedom revealed it to function as it does for the  World Soul .  ‘ἐφ’ ἡμῖν’, or ‘that which depends on us’ ultimately comes from the  individual soul contemplating the forms in Intellect, by becoming one with it and  remaining there .  Freedom cannot be achieved in a pure state in practical life, because  the soul does not remain in Intellect; it must act; however, freedom is enhanced if the  soul does not allow the external world to influence its action.   Plotinus appropriates the concept of kairos from its Pythagorean origins, and  because kairos is contemplation it is not a static moment; the soul requires continual  interaction with the outside world, becoming conscious of it in its perception and  memory of those perceptions, aided by the power of reason that provides knowledge  and the ability to think discursively for deciding action appropriate to the  circumstances.  Providence provides the human soul with everything it needs to  become free and enables it, with the appropriate training, to think like Intellect, that is,  to contemplate substantial numbers and forms, or as has been argued, to think and act  according to the laws of Pythagorean harmonics. </p><div id="pagenum"><p>310</p></div><p id="page">302   Why should we accept that Pythagorean harmonics underpin Plotinus’  philosophy?  In the absence of any other interpretation that potentially resolves so  many perceived ambiguities, and unites Plotinus’ cosmology and psychology, it is a  speculative theory that offers, for the first time, a plausible explanation of Plotinus’  concepts of procession and reversion, and clarification of the nature of logos, a concept  of supreme importance, in that its interpretation determines whether Plotinus’  philosophy makes sense as a complete system.  While it is not explicitly explained in  the text, the evidence suggesting a strong Pythagorean influence on him appears to  support it and develops recent scholarship that has recognised the importance of  musical entities in the Enneads.172  An appreciation of the importance of the science of  harmonics and the Pythagorean influence on Plotinus has the potential to resolve the  acknowledged obscurities perceived by scholars in many areas of Plotinus’  metaphysics, and therefore provides a fresh perspective and basis for further work of  analysis and review of the secondary literature.    Chapter Nine explained how Bergson utilises kairos and the model of harmonics  in his theories of perception, ethics, freedom and his philosophical method of intuition.   The task was easier to achieve with Bergson than it was for Plotinus because his  account of matter and consciousness is integrated in the concept of duration that he  describes as vibrational.  He also makes several specific references to harmonics and  captures the essence of the mythical Kairos of ancient Greece.  It was argued that Bergson’s account of pure perception draws on the physics of  light waves, and hence the law of resonance, to reveal differences in the continuity of  matter and to account for the isolation of an object.  It was noted that he differed from  Plotinus who employed sympathia  in terms of sound vibrations to reveal similarities.                                                                 172  Gersh, 2005; Panaiotidi, 2014 </p><div id="pagenum"><p>311</p></div><p id="page">303   Either way, resonance is the principle that explains the perception of an external object,  and the law of reflection enables Bergson to claim, as does Plotinus, that the pure  perception of an object occurs in the object itself.  The examination of his account of memory clarified that memories are preserved  in the body and the mind as pure memory through correspondence or attunement, only  because of the vibrational quality of matter and consciousness.  The condensation of  pure perception in consciousness triggers a response from inattentive recognition or  habitual body movements that resonate with the present image, and from attentive  recognition as it traverses the different tones or levels of consciousness, making a series  of attempts at reasoning, or synthesising different memory images with the present  perception; an act that is completed when there is either resonance or a harmonisation  of the memory with the present image.  The attempts at synthesis are achieved by  harmonic motion that transforms the present in  the moment of hesitation or delay,  between the brain receiving vibrations from the external keyboard or sense organs and  its resonance or harmonisation with the internal keyboard located in the brain, and  which is influenced by the intention of memory.  The body or brain acts as a node in  the harmonic motion of perception, a node being a harmonic or  kairos, the prelude to  action at the intersection of matter and memory.   While Bergson suggests that at the moment of kairos the brain actualises the  freedom of the perceiving subject by allowing the spontaneous memory to override the  automatic memory, it was questioned how much freedom an individual really has when  operating within a mechanistic model of harmonics.  Like Plotinus, Bergson argues that  freedom is intimately linked with necessity, that God is essentially autonomous and  confers freedom onto us providentially; however, the examination of the theory of  freedom in Time and Free Will  and The Two Sources of Morality and Religion  </p><div id="pagenum"><p>312</p></div><p id="page">304   confirms that freedom is rarely realised.  It is ultimately linked to becoming one with  the élan vital itself, a task only achieved by the supra-intellectual mystics who possess  supreme good sense.  For ordinary individuals kairos is linked to freedom to the degree  that they possess good sense, where kairos is a harmonic linked to sensations, and in  their moral life it is linked to emotion at the intersection of the attitude of closed and  open morality.  The examination of the role of harmonics and kairos in Bergson’s texts not only  resolves the mystery associated with his cosmology, it helps to clarify the relevance of  his pendulum or harmonic motion that is present in all his texts and which explains the  generation of novelty.  The integration of the static and dynamic opposites he proposes  is only possible because the élan vital  generated matter and consciousness as a series of  harmonics, and the creative process is continued as more harmonics are generated at the  moment of kairos, the point at which they coincide.  Matter and Memory , the text  Bergson scholars find the most challenging, becomes much easier to understand.     The Pythagorean tradition connects a philosophy of harmonics with a philosophy  of kairicity and it was argued that Bergson was trained in rhetoric and appears to have  employed the principles of kairos in his philosophical method as they applied to the  ancient Greek art of rhetoric, thus questioning the influence of mathematics as is  commonly accepted by Bergson scholars.   The philosophy of Plotinus and Bergson therefore embodies four key features of  Pythagorean cosmology: firstly, they all have an original source; for the Pythagoreans  it is the ‘central fire’, for Plotinus it is the One, and for Bergson it is God.  Secondly,  the original source emits an energy that is an undifferentiated unity with immense  potentiality; for the Pythagoreans it is the theory of opposites, for Plotinus it is the  indefinite dyad that actualises itself as Being, and for Bergson it is the élan vital as an </p><div id="pagenum"><p>313</p></div><p id="page">305   undifferentiated unity of matter and consciousness. Thirdly, the undifferentiated unity  divides itself into opposite tendencies by a movement that is consistent with the  generation of a fundamental and its harmonics, and the unlimited becomes limited in  the process.  For the Pythagoreans we have a table of opposites that divides according  to numbers in the tetractys; for Plotinus, Intellect divides itself, generating substantial  numbers as a base for the forms; and for Bergson, the tendencies within the élan vital   differentiate, generating the rhythms of duration and the differences in numbers behind  our distinctions of quality, making the proportional nature of the tendencies in life  possible.  It is the differences in number that are expressed as ratios, and it has been  argued that not only do Plotinus and Bergson imply that they are musical ratios, but  their philosophies make more sense if they are considered as such.  Fourthly, at the  moment of kairos the opposites coincide, either harmoniously or disharmoniously,  generating new nodes or harmonics.  For the Pythagoreans this is harmonia   underpinned by an analogy between microcosm and macrocosm, and cosmic sympathy  or resonance, features also found in Plotinus and Bergson.  Finally, Bergson and  Plotinus replicate the Pythagorean tradition by proposing a philosophy that is an open  system of dynamic transformation.  The primary difference that separates the  Pythagoreans from Plotinus and Bergson is that the latter develop Pythagorean  philosophy by utilising the mechanism of harmonic motion by which harmonics are  generated, a mechanism that only became apparent with advances in the field of  acoustics that were evident in their respective eras.  The proposition that the harmonics model underpins the philosophy of Plotinus  and Bergson raises an important question: Why did they not make their intentions  clear?  In respect of Plotinus, the most probable answer is that he followed Plato and  the ancient philosophical tradition for whom an ascetic lifestyle, concealment, secrecy </p><div id="pagenum"><p>314</p></div><p id="page">306   and silence is the norm.  Plato, in his Seventh Letter  also suggests that not everything  was written down:    Every serious man in dealing with really serious subjects carefully avoids  writing, lest thereby he may possibly cast them as a prey to the envy and  stupidity of the public. In one word, then, our conclusion must be that whenever  one sees a man's written compositions—whether they be the laws of a legislator  or anything else in any other form, - these are not his most serious works ( VIIth  Letter, 344c).    Similarly, Aristotle writes about the Timeaus and Plato:     It is true, indeed, that the account he gives there of the participant is different  from what he says in his so-called unwritten teaching. ( Physics 209b 12-14)    Cornford notes that the doctrines of mysticism are secret because they cannot be taught  by intellectual processes; they must be experienced in an emotional or non-rational  state, and the initiate undergoes purification so that he is most receptive to the  experience; however, while the Pythagoreans attempted to intellectualise Orphism, it  retained much of its spiritual nature (Cornford, 1912, pp.198-199).    In Chapter 1 it was explained that Plotinus followed the Pythagorean tradition by  upholding the view that certain information should not be disclosed to the uninitiated,  and in the Preface to Plotinus: Myth, Metaphor, and Philosophical Practice, Stephen  Clark refers to the propensity of Plotinus to encourage guesswork (Clark, 2016, p. xiii).   It is likely that Plotinus remained faithful to his teacher by not openly revealing the  elements of Ammonius’ teaching that he included in the Enneads, and while Plotinus  did not follow Plato in using allegory to hide the Pythagorean teachings, he made  copious use of metaphors and analogies.  It is also important to consider that Porphyry  tells us that Plotinus opened his classes to anyone who wanted to be there; it could be </p><div id="pagenum"><p>315</p></div><p id="page">307   that many of his students had no training in music theory and hence the mathematical  aspect of harmonic theory; so, while Plotinus encouraged education in these subjects he  may not have considered it appropriate for his audience.  On making the statement that  “no one ever writes down everything he or she believes”, Clark also provides valuable  insight about the nature of an oral tradition: “Plotinus’ seminars took their start from  texts and textual commentaries, and that the discipline of philosophy is learned in a  long apprenticeship to some master, not just “from books”.  Furthermore, that the  “living voice” was to be preferred to any written text, as it was only - or at least  principally - from such a voice, such a living presence, that we could hope to pick up  the things that cannot be said but only shown” (Clark, 2016, p.xiv).   As with Plotinus we find that the model of musical harmonics in Bergson’s texts  is not completely hidden and also not that obvious.  The mystery of his cosmology in  Creative Evolution  arises from his use of metaphors to explain the mechanism of the  impulsion and inversion of the élan vital that generates consciousness and matter as  independent tendencies, rather than explaining it as a literal process of harmonic  generation; however, several other links to the field of harmonics and the Pythagorean  tradition have been revealed, though they are speculative.  Can it be mere coincidence  that Bergson applies a number of Aristoxenus’ arguments to his theories of duration,  perception and memory, or that concealed inferences to Pythagoras or Pythagoreanism  appear in his work?  His references to the élan vital  as the ‘breath of life’ and ‘earth’s  hidden fire’; his example of an ‘anvil and hammer’ and the ‘humming of life’s depths’  as well as his comment on ‘vegetarianism’ are comments that seem to suddenly emerge  from nowhere.  One or two could be nothing more than coincidence, with no  Pythagorean link intended; however, five, and there could be more that have gone  unnoticed, raise suspicion, especially when considered with the Pythagorean </p><div id="pagenum"><p>316</p></div><p id="page">308   connection to the harmonics model and kairos.  Similarly, Bergson’s failure to explain  that Plotinus’ logos is substantial number and form could imply that like Plotinus he  followed the tradition in deliberately adopting an attitude of concealment or secrecy; a  further example of ‘silentium philosophorum’ (Casel, 1919).  This may have been  prompted by philosophical influences alone; however, it is very likely that it was  reinforced by the revival of Pythagoreanism in his era that impacted on his personal life  and the wider culture as discussed in Chapter 1.  We cannot ignore the fact that  Bergson would have been subject to these influences, even if only subconsciously;  however subconscious awareness does not appear to be the case because the  Pythagorean influence together with the mechanism of harmonics in his work is too  precise to be mere coincidence.  It is also conceivable that following the praise he  received in his day for the novelty of his philosophy, it would have been uncomfortable  to acknowledge the Pythagorean influence as it would mean admitting that his  philosophy was not as novel as it was assumed to be.     The question of why the harmonics model and Pythagorean influence has not  been acknowledged by commentators on Bergson needs to be addressed.  It is possible  the assumption that Bergson’s musical analogies are merely metaphors may have been  a distraction, as could a reliance on what is explicit in the text; however, the most likely  reason is a lack of understanding of Pythagoreanism and/or the science of harmonics,  from both a scientific and musical perspective.  Bergson’s continual reference to  duration as a melody veils the fact that harmonics are also produced temporally and  have a geometrical and dynamic aspect that is consistent with his theory of duration.  A  contributory factor in the lack of understanding about Pythagoreanism could be, as  Huffman remarks, that Pythagoreanism is a subject that been ignored by most scholars  of ancient history.  Bergson does not explicitly refer to Pythagoreanism as having an </p><div id="pagenum"><p>317</p></div><p id="page">309   influence on him while he does acknowledge Plotinus as his favourite philosopher.   The argument presented in Chapters 3 and 4, that Plotinus also employs the harmonics  model under a strong Pythagorean influence,  has not previously been considered by  Plotinian scholars; however the similarities between the philosophies of Bergson, as  presented in Chapters 5 and 6, and the new interpretation of Plotinus suggest that  Bergson had a much deeper understanding of Plotinus than previously realised; that he  was aware of the harmonics model in the Enneads, and that Plotinus acted as a catalyst  for an additional Pythagorean influence on him.  This builds upon the work of Mossé- Bastide who has already examined the similarities in their philosophies.  The nature of secrecy and concealment presents scholars of Bergson and Plotinus  with difficult challenges because there is much more buried within the texts than they  state explicitly.  The method of study employed has therefore necessitated an  examination of what they specifically say and speculation on what they do not say; and  what has emerged is a new interpretation of both philosophers that makes sense of their  philosophies and reinforces the influence of Plotinus on Bergson.                        </p><div id="pagenum"><p>318</p></div><p id="page">310   Bibliography  *    Aesop.

This course was recorded by  anonymous students, in a notebook with a black cover.  André Ombredane2 was in  possession of this book for a time and he donated it to Jean Guitton3, who passed it on  to us.  It is not known when and how Ombredane had come to own it, but the style is  quite clear, brief, serious and direct, so that there is no doubt that it is attributed to  Bergson. The writing is not Bergson’s.  It is also not unique.  Many scribes have  succeeded each other, with each one making approximately ten pages of notes.  We are  presented with a notebook of the class, on the model imposed by Émile Boutroux at the  École Normale Supérieure.  One student has the responsibility for taking notes for each  lecture, and they are all reread by the teacher/professor.  The text can be stored in the  class library where it can be referred to by the students.  However, this is not a lecture  course that Bergson would have received from Boutroux, because he quotes a work of  Évellin that was published in 1881, after Bergson had left the École normale.   Moreover, it is neither the style nor the general philosophy of Boutroux. The main  influence exerted here is that of Zeller4, who [p.12] Boutroux had translated at the time  when Bergson was a pupil of the latter at the École Normale.   As regards the form, in the Black Notebook we find the manner of Professor  Bergson's inner rhythm, his mode of explanation.  As for its substance, firstly we find  many of his familiar references.  For example, Bergson made reference to Évellin’s  Infinity and Quantity , 1881, which he quoted in Time and Free Will5.  His course on  Socrates draws heavily upon that of Boutroux on the same subject, as do his strong  references to Zeller6.  Furthermore, we find the core interests, the problems and  theories of Bergson's Essai.   The Ionians are presented as physicists and most of the  Presocratics are studied from the standpoint of the philosophy of science.  The Eleatics  are the subject of special attention (two lessons).  Zeno's arguments are detailed and  examined with the greatest care.  In the Black Notebook at the end of the lecture on Zeno of Elea is the following:  “In any event, you should always accept, in the presence of motion, that reality is  absurd or an illusion” (vol. IV p.179), which is a hollowing, or an inversion, of the  germinal Bergsonian intuition.   Here we have the main philosophical document on  which Bergsonism was born, or rather about to be born.  Without being overly  romantic, it is possible to imagine Bergson walking in the main square of Clermont,  turning this amazing formula over in his mind, until the intuition of duration emerges, </p><div id="pagenum"><p>341</p></div><p id="page">3   the formula of which was only indicated by the presence of the paradox7.  It also  demonstrates the date of the course, the oldest that we have of Bergson.   But let us  return to the subject of its date.  Henri Gouhier once said to me: While it is obviously after 1881, the date of  Évellin’s book, this course is no less obviously prior to 1896, the date of the publication  of Matter and Memory .  In fact you will notice that in the Black Notebook, Bergson  explicitly rejects the fourth argument of Zeno of Elea, the stadium, and is only  interested in the first three, since in his eyes only they are worthy of consideration.   However, in Matter and Memory , p.328 a significant note [p.13] rehabilitates the  stadium argument and concludes: "The fourth argument is exactly the same as the other  three."  The notes in the Black Notebook have therefore been taken between 1881 and  1896. Could we narrow it down?  Both the level and type of education given in the Black Notebook make it  unsuitable for pupils in the Baccalauréat class, and for pupils in the second year  preparatory class for literary studies [at the Écoles Normales Supérieures], for whom it  would be far too scholarly and meticulous.  Rather, it seems to be intended for  philosophy students. But additionally, it is difficult to compare it with the  unconventional style, the brilliance of expression and the masterful authority in the  course on Plotinus taught at the École Normale.  It therefore could not have been  delivered there or at the Collège de France. Bergson’s only university teaching that can  match the characteristics of the Black Notebook was during the years when he was  teaching at the University of Clermont, between February 1884 and June 1888. We can  therefore date the Black Notebook to that period.  Let us reconsider the list of courses for which Bergson was responsible over  several years at this university8.  Bergson, among others, was responsible for a  comprehensive education in the history of Greek philosophy.  The Black Notebook is  probably the first of the courses; the final one is lost, or currently misplaced. Since he  chose to teach Greek philosophy in chronological order, can we say that common sense  tells us that the Black Notebook relates Bergson’s first ever academic teaching at  Clermont?  In our opinion, the reading makes it extremely likely.  We conclude that the  Black Notebook dates from 1884 or 1885 at the latest.  It contains the first third of a course Bergson devoted to the history of Greek  philosophy from Thales to Plato. The book is full.  The presentation of Plato begins in </p><div id="pagenum"><p>342</p></div><p id="page">4   the last few pages and had to continue in another book, because there is no trace of any  conclusion whatsoever in the last page of the book.  There are therefore four texts and courses presented in this fourth and final  volume.  These courses are edited with the accompaniment of notes, the addition of which  obeys the following rules:  1. To indicate when necessary, or suggest, parallels within  the Course or to locations in Bergson’s works.  2. To clarify the main references and  identify the main quotations, especially when it may support better reading, without  breaking it up more than is reasonable.  3. Indicate places where the Course permits, or  where we are required, to clarify the interpretation of the works.  4. Not to smother  Bergson’s text in an extravagance or a wealth of Hellenistic scholarship, claiming to  clarify it, which would risk distorting Bergson’s undertaking.  Bergson remains a bold  and creative thinker [p.14] for whom knowledge of opinions and doctrines is never a  means towards the knowledge of things.  This volume, like the previous three, is content with providing texts to feed  reflection on philosophers and hopes to contribute to the revival of Bergson studies.  The Introduction is not the place to present the conclusions for which we have  grounds, particularly concerning the origin and the deep logical sequencing of the  various works published by Bergson.  Let's just say that he draws extensively upon the  Stoics; that with Plotinus he leaves aside everything Platonic (in the sense he intends,  that is to say, the theory of ideas and the interpretation given to it) and brings a Jewish  or Christian influence to his thinking of the One.  The universe is a sympathetic whole  and a double process of materialization/spiritualisation, as we see in Matter and  Memory.  It is also a process of pluralisation. But Bergson reverses the Plotinian  system.  Pluralisation goes in the direction of spiritualisation. The future is not a  deprivation of the Absolute but a glory for God.  Above all, the system of necessity  must leave scope for the narrative of a universal history where the free personality is  the unsurpassable term of all change, and which expresses itself as an act of divine  freedom: hence, Creative Evolution .  But from the outset ecstasy is always seen as a  summit to discover, hence The Two Sources of Morality and Religion .  If it does not present in detail the image of the history of Greek philosophy that  emerges from Bergson’s courses, it cannot avoid saying a word about it, brief and to  the point.  Bergson is primarily interested in the Ionians, and Heraclitus, as physicists.  He opposed the Eleatics from the outset.  He appreciates Socrates as a mystic and that </p><div id="pagenum"><p>343</p></div><p id="page">5   he was concerned with moral existence.  He retains very little of Plato and bypasses the  philosophy of Ideas; also Zenoism.  He appreciates Aristotle, whose realism and  intuitions are an approximation of his own thought.  He returns however to the Ionians,  via the Stoics, but goes further than Plotinus. He is Plotinian a little like Marx was  Hegelian.  Bergson seems to have thought that the system of Plotinus was upside down,  and he was putting it back on his feet.  The fall of the soul becomes the ascendancy of  the soul.  Action is not a diminution but a fulfilment in which even ecstasy has to  develop so that mysticism is complete. The ineffable One is also as personal as  possible.  The point of view of the culture of the free personality undoubtedly takes it  on to that of reabsorption within the whole9.  The general spirit is unmistakably mystic,  but a mysticism that he would like to make as positive as possible.    These courses of Bergson help us to know his specific thinking on a large number  of subjects, on the condition that a precise [p.15] method of appropriate interpretation  has been developed.  The principle of such a method lies initially in the precise  comprehension of the conceptions/ impressions Bergson had from studying the  philosophical doctrines.  Take a doctrine studied (e.g., that of Plotinus, the Stoics, etc.). Bergson always  presented it as a doctrine in itself, impersonal and scientific in the broad sense, that is to  say, based on experience that is theoretically renewable and the arguments critically  analysable10.  This is not an object of history, in the sense that it would be a lifeless  object: it is a thought that is always possible, always possibly living, provided that one  can revive it11; and considered as always possibly true of a rational truth.  Bergson’s  outlines are mostly "objective", but when he takes the point of view of the author  studied (e.g., Plotinus), it is not as if it were a question of him coinciding with a process  of thought which would be constitutive of its object. Bergson is indeed realistic.   Rather, he thus adopts in his reading the conduct of a friend of the author, who would  like to coincide with the view and the certainty which the author himself had of certain  things existing in them, and which the friend would like to be able to see as the author  himself says to have seen them.  In the end, it may therefore be an agreement and  understanding of the community view. The interpretation is thus an effort to review  what has been seen and critically to ensure an effective identity between what was seen  by the friend and what had been seen by the author.   </p><div id="pagenum"><p>344</p></div><p id="page">6   The interpretation of what has is said is only possible with a view of the thing  about which it is spoken, and the interpretation of ideas cannot be separated from a  judgment about the truth or falsity of the ideas.  Historical objectivity is thus possible  only by philosophical judgment, provided that the latter is not the effect of a  reconstruction a priori12.  There is often disagreement; the friend (e.g. Bergson) including well what  appeared to the author (e.g., Plotinus), but also including how and why the author could  say that he had seen this or that, when he had not seen it accurately.  However, the  unwritten law of the explanation of the doctrine is that a friend of the author does not  always express his own judgment, rather disappearing behind the thought of the author.   And yet, if a presentation is lively, the friend has his judgement but does not allow it to  penetrate in the same way as when he presents the thought of the author.  As friends of  Bergson, our problem consists in discovering his thoughts about certain things; finding  his unspoken judgment wrapped up in the way he explains another author’s words  about [p.16] certain things in question.  Undoubtedly this is a very general rule of  hermeneutics, but it is particularly challenging in the case of the study of Bergson.  The  comprehension of Bergsonian realism requires hermeneutics that is itself realistic.  Sometimes, when making notes, we engage in exercises of this kind in order to  illustrate a possible method and make suggestions.  Such a method naturally presupposes that we have a personal course and it is  good that Bergson speaks while engaging personally, albeit discreetly, with his  thinker's authority.  However, such is generally the case.  It would be surprising if we only wanted to judge the Course of Professor  Bergson by subsuming these "Bergson’s lectures on philosophy" under the general idea  of "philosophy lectures" and that of "Bergson’s lectures" under that of "lectures in  general".  These are only general ideas, while they are a summary of a set of  experiences of a collection of individuals whose average level is, by definition,  average.  But we must judge things on the basis of their most complete copies.  Having claimed to deduce that a Bergson lecture would necessarily be impersonal  because a lecture tends to be rather impersonal, and that a teacher would not think  much because otherwise he would not be teaching, he must be resolved to state a fact,  always being strong enough to work through what we imagine to be a principle: with  Bergson we have a thinker who teaches as a thinker teaching, freely sovereign,  admirable and gushing creativity, armed  with the undivided fullness of his power to </p><div id="pagenum"><p>345</p></div><p id="page">7   see and judge.  The commonplace parts of his lectures are there to heighten the most  relevant; just as one needs wood to make the strings resonate. The radiance of his  teaching has no explanation other than the manifestation of his genius.   Bergson  reminds us that a civil servant who helps a student to acquire a diploma can also be a  master who helps a disciple to walk towards the truth.  He reminds all teachers of the  nobility of their profession. Everything one says is forgotten, the dust settles, only the  sacred fire and Life remain.  This Volume IV concludes the publication of Bergson’s Lectures, an undertaking  of 15 years.  My gratitude goes first to Annie Neuberger, niece of the philosopher, his  worthy successor; then to Jean Guitton and to the memory of Henri Gouhier, two  unforgettable masters; to Françoise Vinel and Remi Brague, whose collaboration was  so valuable; to Jean-Louis Dumas, Catherine Brisson, Thibaud Collin, always faithful;  to Peter Magnard, generous friend; to Jean-Luc Marion, who hosts this prestigious  work in the "Epimetheus" collection; to Claire.

One finds a wealth of alleged  references in Diogenes, Proclus, Stobaeus.  We even have texts claimed to be written  by Pythagoras; [p. 181] but there is evidence that the texts are not authentic.  Furthermore, it has pretty much been shown that there was no disclosure of  Pythagoreanism before Philolaus the Pythagorean.  It is therefore possible that the  fragments of Philolaus are genuine, but those attributed to earlier philosophers may be  regarded as dubious.   Intermediary sources are considerable but most unreliable.  During the third and  second centuries, a kind of Pythagorean legend develops, and at the time of neo- Pythagoreanism, a host of texts appear that have the effect of Pythagoreanism, but these  writings only resemble theories of Pythagoras to a small degree.  It is true to say that by  way of authentic documents, we only have Aristotle's texts, and the most accurate and  reliable information comes from commentators of Aristotle who merely repeat him.   We shall therefore refer to him.   In summary, the authentic immediate sources are meagre: the pieces of  information are few, but probably accurate.  As for the later sources, since they only  repeat Aristotle they have no value.  It is therefore difficult to study the doctrine of each  particular Pythagorean, so we shall study Pythagoreanism in general.    Pythagoras, born in Samos between 584 and 581 BC, came to Italy between  544 and 542.  He undertook several journeys.  He founded a kind of moral and political  religious society at Croton, in Magna Graecia.  The tendency of this association was  aristocratic.  Nevertheless, there he preached to the community about well-being.  An  initiation was a prerequisite for entering the Society.  Silence was imposed on novices.  They recognised each other by using mysterious signs.  Perhaps this information is not  authentic, but it is interesting because it confirms the opinion that we have of  Pythagoreanism: that this doctrine probably is of foreign oriental origin.  In any event,  its political character proved fatal.  Pythagoras, driven out of Croton, died in  Metapontum.   Other Pythagoreans lived outside Italy: Philolaus, Lysis, Timaeus of Locri,  Eurytus, etc.   Others lived in Italy: Clinias, Archytas of Tarentum, the latter in about 375.       </p><div id="pagenum"><p>349</p></div><p id="page">3   [p.182] 1. Exposition of the System    The principle of Pythagoreanism is clear in Aristotle ( Metaphysics , I, 5).  Mathematical principles are the principles of things, and the elements of numbers are  the elements of all beings.  Everything is explained.  Before interpreting this principle,  it is necessary to indicate the reasons which could have lead the Pythagoreans to pose  it.  1. According to Aristotle, the Pythagoreans remarkably believed that  things bore more resemblance to numbers than to fire, earth or water.  2. Numbers appeared prior to anything else, which probably means that  things are understandable, intelligible only by means of numbers.  Philolaus says in a  fragment: "It is number that makes things knowable, nothing is knowable without  number, and all that is known is number"48.  It is impossible to conceive anything  without it.  The Pythagoreans are therefore mathematicians who, struck by the  relationship between things and the constructions of mathematics, imagined that the  principles of mathematics were the principles of things.  But in what sense have they  considered numbers as the principles of things?  What is the nature of number as understood by the Pythagoreans?  Does it exist  by itself or is it an attribute?  Is number a substance or is it only a quality of things?  A  text of Aristotle gets us out of an embarrassing situation on this point ( Physics, III, 4).  Aristotle says that, according to the Pythagoreans, the principle of things, infinity,  exists by itself and not as an attribute.  However, we will see that according to the  Pythagoreans the infinite is only part of number.  But if number exists by itself, is it  able to exist separately?  In other words, is the world considered as pure number  something real or is it a simple abstraction of the mind?  The texts seem to indicate that  the Pythagoreans considered numbers as bound to sensible things in such a way that it  cannot be detached by an effort of abstraction.  The number in the thing is [p.183] the  principle of the thing.  However, discussions have been raised on this point.  In fact,  Aristotle tells us that, according to the Pythagoreans, things are numbers.  He also tells  us that the Pythagoreans make number the material cause of things; and on the other  hand, in a passage of Metaphysics , I.6, Aristotle tells us: “Plato professes participation,  and in that respect, he only changes the word used by the Pythagoreans.  The  Pythagoreans say that things exist by imitation of numbers and Plato only replaces the  word imitation with the word participation, μίμησις becomes μέθεξις”.  Moreover, the </p><div id="pagenum"><p>350</p></div><p id="page">4   text of Stobaeus (1-302) could confirm Aristotle’s testimony.  “I know, he said, that  many consider Pythagoras as having said that things arise from number, but in reality,  Pythagoras did not say that things come from number, but that they are according to  number, κατ'άριθμόν”.49  It seems difficult to reconcile the opposing texts.  According  to some critics, and Brandis50 in particular, there would be two opposing tendencies  among the Pythagoreans.  According to one, number would have been the immanent  principle of things; and, according to the other, number would be an ideal, of which  things would be made as an imitation.  But none of Aristotle's texts gives us the right to  distinguish between these two tendencies.  On the other hand, in Metaphysics , I.5, we  find a phrase which perhaps allows us to reconcile seemingly contradictory texts:  "Because the Pythagoreans found a resemblance between numbers and things, they  accepted that number is the principle of things".  It seems likely that, among the  Pythagoreans, confusion occurred between simple resemblance and identity.  Such  confusion now seems strange, because later philosophical doctrines have clearly fixed  and distinguished both notions.  But it seems unlikely that the Pythagoreans made a  difference between resemblance and constant conformity, and absolute identity.   Perceiving that things are subject to precise mathematical relationships that had the  character of number, they concluded that they were numbers.  It was only several  centuries later that we came to distinguish between the two conceptions.  Some fixed  their attention on the reason given by the Pythagoreans: simple resemblance; others on  the conclusion they drew: identity or immanence.  What it is necessary [p.184] to say,  is that for the Pythagoreans, as Aristotle clearly said, number is the principle of things  because things resemble numbers.  In summary, we will singularly clarify the dominant thought of Pythagoreanism  if one is transported to the fragment of Philolaus where it says: "If we want to explain  the harmonious arrangement of things, it is necessary to put harmony inside things.”   The Pythagoreans, mathematicians above all, perceiving that things are intelligible  when they are reduced to numbers, conceived the idea of putting number inside things  like matter, moreover matter that is immanent.  Aristotle’s expression is extremely  accurate51.  In fact, the Pythagoreans, having not yet distinguished a metaphysical  principle from a material principle, had not realised that the reality of things and their  intelligibility are two separate things; perceiving that number is the condition for the  intelligibility of things, they concluded that number constituted the substance, the </p><div id="pagenum"><p>351</p></div><p id="page">5   matter of things.  Number is a metaphysical principle used as material principle by  philosophers who did not make the distinction.  One last question remains to be resolved, concerning the nature of Pythagorean  number.  This issue is raised in a text of Aristotle, Metaphysics , XIII, 6.  It says that the  Pythagoreans make sensible things consist in numbers.  They therefore consider units,  says Aristotle, as having magnitude, but, how the first One, the first unit was able to  acquire magnitude, is a problem for them.  From this text it seems that Pythagorean  number is something corporeal, material, and this theory was in fact supported by  several historians.  Number would be regarded by the Pythagoreans as matter from  where things emerge, as they would emerge from water, air, fire, etc., according to  other philosophers.  This opinion seems inconsistent with Aristotle’s other, more  accurate texts, where it is said that number is subject and not an attribute; it is substance  itself, without the need of any natural quality.  Furthermore, Aristotle called  Pythagorean number μαθηματικός [mathematical].  Therefore, it is not material.   Elsewhere Aristotle [p.185] criticizes the Pythagoreans in that it is a contradiction to  have regarded material bodies as forms of mathematical number.  So, the materialist  interpretation of German historians Reinhold and Brandis cannot be accepted.  But  another historian, Retter52, suggested a fine, even though, in our opinion, just as  inaccurate interpretation.  According to him Pythagorean number, without itself being  material, would be a geometric entity: the unit would be the point and the numbers  relationships of magnitudes in space.  Thus, the Pythagoreans would have reduced all  bodies to their geometric properties and it would be these geometrical properties which  they would have represented by numbers.  Note that a theory of this kind is hardly  possible before Democritus. This way, the point would be identified with the atom.   However, the atom is a direct product of the eclecticism after Pythagoreanism.  In  reality, the challenge is to explain the text we quoted at the beginning.  But note the  historical process of Aristotle: his interpretation of his predecessors is based on his  ideas.  According to him likeness only explains its likeness.  Consequently, extended  elements are needed to explain extended things.  So, for Aristotle, if the Pythagoreans  reduced things to numbers it is because they granted extension to numbers.  But the  Pythagoreans never expressed this opinion, and if Aristotle makes them say it, it seems  absurd, contradictory, to assume that an extended thing is formed with un-extended  elements.  The evidence that they have not said it comes from words in the phrase from  Aristotle: “how the first One, the first unit was able to acquire magnitude, is a problem </p><div id="pagenum"><p>352</p></div><p id="page">6   for them”53.  Indeed, they would have a problem with giving material magnitude to the  units if they considered number as purely mathematical.  Knowing the nature of number in general, we ask, how did the Pythagoreans  apply number to make it the general explanation of things?  The numbers are divided into even and odd. There is even a third category, odd- even numbers.  They identify the odd with the unlimited, infinity, because it puts an end to the  division by two.  Alternatively, even is considered [p.186] finished, perfect.  Thus,  even numbers, odd numbers and even-odd numbers, whose nature is very obscure, are  the various categories of numbers used by them.  The Opposites. The even and odd constitute two opposing determinations.  Presumably, the oppositions between the qualities of things are reducible to the  fundamental opposition of unlimited and limited.  The Pythagoreans compiled a table  of opposites. They are ten in number:  1. Limited and Unlimited  2. Odd and Even  3. Unity and Multiplicity  4. Right and Left  5. Masculine and Feminine  6. Rest and Movement  7. Straight and Curved  8. Light and Darkness  9. Good and Bad  10. Square and Rectangle    Harmony.  The elements of things, that are different in nature, must be linked to  bring together opposite determinations in each object.  This is what harmony consists  of.  Within all things, there are oppositions first, then a harmony that unites them all.  This results from the fact that everything is reduced to a number.  But every number is  composed of even and odd, and yet any number is one.  In other words, the  Pythagoreans noticed that number is one and multiple at the same time.  It therefore  combines opposites and substance so to speak, and since everything is number, it must  be admitted that the opposite qualities that we find in any object, right and left, straight </p><div id="pagenum"><p>353</p></div><p id="page">7   and curved, etc., are reduced to the numerical oppositions of even and odd, which  makes the unity of an object; it is the same cause that makes the unity of number.  This theory of opposition and harmony is quite obscure.  So, it is not surprising  that various interpretations have been [p.187] proposed in antiquity, and which for the  most part inspired ideas after Pythagoreanism.  The principal of these pantheistic explanations is to be found in antiquity.   According to the Neo-Pythagoreans and the Neo-Platonists, Pythagoras would have  identified the One with Divinity.  From this original unity two principles would  emerge: the One and the indefinite duality.  Everything good must be attributed to the  first of these two principles, and everything evil to the second.  And it is these two  principles, diversifying and taking on different forms, which have given rise to the  contrary qualities we find listed in the table of opposites.  We recognise here, in a  slightly modified form the doctrine of the Neo-Platonists and Alexandrians.  They  assumed the emergence from unity and superior origin of thought and even existence;  multiplicity by a sort of procession.  But this opposition of unity and the dyad, and  especially the progress of being, come from ideas that date back to the later time of  Greek philosophy.  We said that Aristotle's texts are the only ones that deserve any  confidence when it comes to the essential points of Pythagoreanism; however, all other  texts which we could use for such an interpretation are much later.  It is not until the  first century that a similar theory is found in Alexander Polyhistor, the historian.  It is  certain that the Pythagoreans recognised multiple gods, while following to a certain  extent the direction of monotheism, which was so important in philosophy starting from  Xenophanes.  We therefore reject it as being like a neo-Platonic theory, the idea of the  development of God in the world, of a division, an emanation of the original unity  giving birth to the oppositions of the one and the many. This is a pantheistic theory  which the Pythagoreans probably never considered.54  To apply numbers to things, they almost always resorted to superficial  analogies.  Aristotle says that if the Pythagoreans encountered some analogy between  numbers and celestial phenomena, they expressed this by it, and if there were gaps  between things, they filled them with some elements.  For example, they concluded that since the decad was the perfect number, there  are ten planets, but as we saw only nine, they [p.188] invented the antichthon or  counter-earth to complete the number.  One finds a considerable number of  symbolisations of the same kind.  So, Justice which consists of making like for like is </p><div id="pagenum"><p>354</p></div><p id="page">8   identical to the square, and as the square is identical to 4, they represented justice by 4.   The occasion is the number 7 because the moon changes phase every seven days,  because some diseases include seven periods, etc.  Marriage was represented by the  number 5, the sum of the first male number 3 and first female number 2.  However, it  should not be assumed that these connections are always made without method.  Pythagoreanism gradually progressed systematically: music, geometry, physics and  natural history.  Arithmetic.  Pythagorean arithmetic was dominated by the importance attributed  to the decad.  The Pythagoreans are said to have invented the system of decimal  numeration.  The invention of the so-called Arabic numerals must probably be  attributed to them.  The number 4 was also of great importance in the system because it  is the first square and because the sum of the first four digits is 10. The numbers 3, 4, 5  were also favoured, because the sum of the squares of the first two is equal to the  square of the third.  Music.  The Pythagoreans made great strides into the theoretical study of  music55.  They determined the relationships which exist between the pitch of a sound  and the length of the vibrating string.  For the fourth they found the ratio 3/4, 2/3 for  the fifth, and 1/2 for the octave.  Geometry.  They had the idea that would later return with Descartes, to  represent figures with arithmetical symbols.  Descartes had to make use of them for  creating a line for the law of motion.  This lead to analytical geometry, in which they  limited themselves to artificial integrations [links].56  Physics.  According to Philolaus, the Pythagoreans acknowledged five  primordial bodies: earth, fire, air, water, and a fifth of which it is difficult to determine  the exact nature.  Cosmogony.  Pythagoras believed in a beginning of the world.  Initially fire  forms at the heart of the universe.  This central fire draws [p.189] portions of the  infinite and this attraction gives form to the indefinite.  So, the world was formed as a  sphere, having fire in the centre and rotating from west to east around the fire.  There  are ten celestial bodies.  According to the first Pythagoreans, the earth is spherical, but  it does not revolve around the sun.  However, little by little, the Pythagoreans admire  not only a movement of the earth around the sun, but also a movement of rotation on  itself.  Harmony is the result of these revolutions around the central fire.  Indeed, these  bodies move quickly, and all motion gives a sound whose pitch is in a certain </p><div id="pagenum"><p>355</p></div><p id="page">9   relationship with the speed of the mobile.  Thus, each of the celestial bodies, while  rotating, produces a special note, and all the notes together produce a harmony.  It is  habit that prevents us from hearing the music.  Moral Ideas.  This moral doctrine, as Zeller has shown, is not one with the  philosophical doctrine of the Pythagoreans.  Pythagoras is above all commonly known  for his doctrine of metempsychosis.  But this is precisely what does not belong to him;  he borrowed it from the East.  Thus, the soul would be in the body as in a prison, and  the day that it separates, it may enjoy an immaterial life if it is made worthy.  The duty  of man on earth is to purify himself morally.  It happens by controlling his conduct,  above all by fighting caprice.  Pythagoras recommended respect for parents and the  law, loyalty, friendship, respect for old age, and especially of proportion and  moderation.  It is also pretty well established that within Pythagoreanism moral  qualities and virtues were represented by numbers.  It is difficult to know what  consequences were drawn from this symbolisation.  What should we take from Pythagoreanism?  What is obvious, is the  indisputable, undeniable fecundity within the mathematical abstractions - and  convinced, the Pythagoreans acknowledged it - contending that everything is number  and that nothing is knowable other than by number.  Any specialist has experienced a  similar tendency, a tendency to explain all things by the science he knows best.  This is  the starting point, the reason for this idea.  It is indisputable that this idea has given the  Pythagoreans [p.190] superiority over the Ionians.  They understood that, when it  comes to science, the main question to ask of scientific explanation is; will the  explanation be convenient for the mind?  Without making the distinction between the  subjective and the objective, they glimpsed that the object, the absolute such as it is in  itself, is not probably an object of science57, and that the mind should simply choose,  between all the possible conceptions of things, the one that lends itself to calculation  and best satisfies our needs.  So, the idea of explaining things with an intelligible  element represents real and significant progress.  On this point, we can put the  Pythagoreans and the Eleatics on the same plane.  But the Pythagoreans are superior to  the Eleatics; not only because they understood that we must firstly be concerned about  intelligible explanation, but they foresaw what was to become classic of our times, that  the most intelligible scientific explanation is a mathematical explanation.  It is Descartes who gave this idea its legitimate place in science, but the  Pythagoreans were the first to have glimpsed it.  They realized that to explain things, is </p><div id="pagenum"><p>356</p></div><p id="page">10   above all to represent them with symbols and that the object of science is to substitute a  mathematical symbol for the object.  This idea is enough to make the Pythagoreans  unparalleled.  They are, perhaps with the atomists, those who best understood science.  (Aristotle is far from having understood ideal science with this precision.)  But they did not understand that the application of the mathematical symbol for  things had to be made, not because of a superficial analogy, but after conscious  observation.  It is firstly the perfecting of the methods of investigation, physical  appearance, then the analysis of the phenomena of heat.  Therefore science, as the  moderns see it, includes two processes, two approaches:  1.   The study of mathematics and the progressive development of the science.  2.   The systematic and reasoned application of mathematics to physical things,  following observation, experiment and all kinds of assumptions.  [p.191] The Pythagoreans had excellently grasped the principles of these two  operations.  Regarding the first, they not only grasped the principles, but they drew  conclusions which made them the most skilful mathematicians of antiquity.  But they  were misguided in the second.  They believed that between nature and the mind there  was an agreement such that one could, by virtue of superficial analogies, choose a  number and substitute it for the object.  It is for this side of their doctrine that they are  often ridiculed.  But we must not forget that the basic idea of the Pythagoreans was  taken on by Descartes and dominates the whole of modern science.        IV  NOTES OF  The Black Notebook    48.

The authenticity of this course is not in doubt. We find evidence:  1. In the chosen subjects and direction of research.  It is without fear of  retrospective illusion that one detects the author of Matter and Memory  in its reading,  the theory of logoi faithful and sympathetic, but staggered and full of unexpressed  reinterpretation.  Bergson applies his intellectual effort to the question of Plotinus’  World Soul and its relation to individual souls.  The question that arises at the outset is:  "What does it mean to be alive?”1    [p.6] Bergson emphasizes the individuality of Plotinus’ Ideas and logoi, and he finished  his course with a lecture on consciousness in Plotinus.  2. In the characterization of Plotinus’ method:  "His metaphysical method  is deep introspection, which is to go beyond the ideas by appealing to a deep sympathy  between our soul and the whole of reality.  (…) His method is psychological.  And  therefore, it is natural that his attention had been drawn, more than that of Aristotle, to  psychology, the life of the soul.2  3. The style itself: a) images/concepts and their treatment (the cone3, the  diffracted rays4, distention5, etc.).  b) a number of words, expressions and ideas that are  quite characteristic, such as, for example, “The more the logos works the more it  divides itself.  It deposits more and more forms which it maintained united within it,  etc.”6; or when he speaks of Plotinus who proceeds “not by juxtaposition, but digging  so deeply beneath the ideas he brought forth the source from which these ideas had  sprung.”7 Or again, the passage on the method cited above; and one could extend such a  list.  These three kinds of internal evidence develop the overall impression of being  in the presence of the man and of feeling the lead of the master.  Prof. Pierre Magnard  said it perfectly in 1989 during a conference devoted this course of Bergson at the  Congress of Clermont.7    From the nature of the subject, which is neither from the program of the  baccalaureate class nor from preparation to compete for the ENS, and by its scientific  level (both of erudition and of speculation), it can only be a course of higher education.   It cannot have been given at the Faculty of Clermont-Ferrand, where Bergson was </p><div id="pagenum"><p>361</p></div><p id="page">3   responsible for teaching classes between 1885 and 1888.  Firstly, no course on this  subject is listed in the programs published by the Academy of Clermont (and  reproduced in the volume of Mélanges);8 and secondly, the style and authority of the  master, the writing and casualness of the listener, excludes it from being the work of a  novice teacher addressing novices.   The course [p.7] in question could therefore have  been given at the École Normale Supérieure, where Bergson was a senior lecturer from  February 1898 to November 1900, or at the Collège de France, where he was elected  (Chair of Greek and Latin philosophy) in April 1900; but the course would not have  been given at the Collège de France, because of its very general character.  For  comparison, in 1901-1902, Bergson lectured on the ninth book of Ennead VI at the  Collège.9   The lectures on Plotinus must therefore have been given at the École  Normale, and probably over a whole school year, which leads to a credible date  between 1898 and 1899.   For confirmation, a clear reference to the latin thesis of Couturat on Platonic  myths, dating from 1896, can be noted on p.55 manuscript of this course.  The course is  after the publication of Matter and Memory10 and contemporaneous with the  preparation for Creative Evolution .11   It provides a magnificent testimony and an  irreplaceable document both on the genesis of Creative Evolution , and as the so  delicate suture between Evolution  and Matter and Memory .      Notes    1. This is the subject of Ennead I, 1, but Bergson declared the order adopted by  Porphyry to be arbitrary and that it does not follow the development of Plotinus’  thought.  2.

It is important to  establish if the study of his life confirms this impression from reading his work.  The primary source of information is Porphyry’s The Life of Plotinus2; however  there is some very concise information from Eunapius3 in his Vitae sophistarum  (Life  of the Sophists) (Ed. Boissonnade, 1824), and a few words in Eudoxus4.  The  information provided by Porphyry must be accepted barring exaggeration in  expression, because at that time Plotinus was greatly admired and fascinated his  followers.  The name Plotinus is Latin: he came from a Roman family of Egyptian origin.   He was born in 209 AD.  Disdainful of material life, he would not talk about his birth,  or of his family or country, nor would he allow a portrait.  Eunapius tells us <2> that he  was born in Lyco, and the other two refer to him as Lycopolitan; however, this does not  determine whether they are referring to Lycopolis, Thessaly.  The detail is not  important.    [p.18] He came to study in Alexandria at the age of twenty-eight and devoted  himself exclusively to philosophy.  He was not happy with the schools he attended until  he was presented to Ammonius Saccas who he followed with enthusiasm.  What were  these schools?  Towards the middle of the third century Alexandria had long been the seat of a  great scientific movement.  It was a place where the exact sciences, and predominately  the human sciences, were cultivated.  It was home to a number of commentators, not  least on Plato and Aristotle.  In addition, throughout the Roman period, philosophers  were represented in almost all ancient Greek schools.  It was a time of learning and  eclecticism.  They taught the same doctrines of Heraclitus and Pythagoras, and the field  supported the emergence of a system that would bring together all the ideas of the  teachers of Greek philosophy5.  <3>  It is certain that this purely Greek education had a decisive influence on  Plotinus.  But we must also mention other sources of influence.  Firstly, Jewish-Alexandrian philosophy represented by Philo.  Had he read Philo?  It cannot be proven; however, he knew one of his disciples, the neo-Pythagorean </p><div id="pagenum"><p>365</p></div><p id="page">3   Numenius.  Porphyry protests against those who claim that Plotinus had stolen ideas  from Numenius, proving that he was influenced by him.  Plotinus could have known  Philo through this intermediary.  Philo combined Platonism and Judaism, and we can establish some similarities  between Philo and Plotinus.  Philo spoke of a God above science, κρεῖττον τῆς  ἐπιοτήμης and he immediately set the world of ideas below it, which he locked, it is  true, in a logos.  The question is whether these ideas have the same meaning.  Perhaps  the resemblance <4> is purely external.  Perhaps it is only for his suggestions that  Plotinus is beholden to him.  Finally, Plotinus has nothing in common with Philo that  cannot be found in Plato.  Additionally, we must consider an important doctrine of Syria, gnosis, a mixture  of Christian doctrine, Eastern mythology and Greek speculation, which proposed a  theory of successive emanations of the Godhead, which was considered a heresy in  Christianity.  Section 9 of Ennead II is a refutation of the Gnostics, and a refutation  leaving nothing in common with them.  [p.19] There remains the Christian doctrine of Clement and Origen, but there is  little trace of it in Plotinus.  Presumably, like Gnosticism he knew about Christianity.  Therefore, Plotinus probably commenced his studies with Greek philosophy and  religious philosophy, i.e. Judeo-Alexandrian and Gnostic.  Porphyry tells us that  Plotinus countered all of them.  Only Ammonius held his interest, so who was he?  <5>  We know little about him.  Plotinus does not mention him once.  Ammonius  wrote nothing.  We only have two witnesses to his doctrine.  l. - That of Nemesius6, a Greek Christian bishop of the fifth century (περὶ φὑσεως  ἀνθρὡπου), who cites two passages that refer to the views of Ammonius.  2. - That of Hierocles, a fifth century Neoplatonist who referred to Ammonius in  a fragment of his Treatise on Providence7.  What Nemesius has preserved for us is the "developments" of Ammonius on  immortality and the relationship of the soul to the body.  Firstly, he taught that the soul is essential to the body because the body is subject  to a thousand vicissitudes, made of multiple dissolvable elements and which needs a  principle that retains that which is constant, συν έχον τι (p.29).  It is Aristotle’s  expression; there is nothing new.  Secondly (p. 56) it is said that the soul enters νοῦς when it ceases to reason,  λογίζεσθαι, on passing into intuition.  He adds that it is united with the body as the </p><div id="pagenum"><p>366</p></div><p id="page">4   sunlight is united with air.  It is not the soul which is in the body, but the body is in the  soul.  These are theories that we find unchanged in Plotinus, not only in substance but  in form.  We must therefore accept that Plotinus not only borrowed ideas of primary  importance from him, but also the same phrases that Ammonius used, and without  quoting him, he who so loves to quote.  But this treatise was written two centuries after  Ammonius who wrote nothing.  Nemesius notes his words as if he were an immediate  disciple of Ammonius, but he could not have known Ammonius’ ideas with precision.   This would necessarily require a written account of the ideas of this philosopher at that  time.  However, one can be certain that there never was one.  Had there been [p.20] a  statement like that, containing the basic ideas of the Alexandrian, it would have been so  important, cited by Plotinus and some of the philosophers of Alexandria.  However, this  is not so.  Porphyry only named him explicitly in the Life of Plotinus8 once in passing,  and neither Iamblichus nor Proclus mentioned him.  We cannot accept the existence of  such a statement, but we can go further.  There are positive reasons to believe that Ammonius never professed any ideas  that play an important role in Plotinus.  Plotinus was not the only pupil of Ammonius.  Longinus was as well.  If Plotinus had accepted at face value the important ideas of  Ammonius, a mediocre thinker such as Longinus would have noted it.  Yet in a letter  from Longinus to Porphyry, he said that despite his admiration for Plotinus, he did not  accept his theories ( Life of Plotinus , §19).  And at §21, Longinus says that Plotinus has  his own way of philosophising9.   The truth seems to be that Nemesius text presents no guarantee.  The opinions  and expressions attributed to Ammonius were taken by Plotinus or by any Alexandrian  having quoted Plotinus.  When a tradition had been made of Ammonius the founder of  the School, and because he was followed by Plotinus, it was natural for those who  passed for his disciples to pick up on Ammonius’ ideas.  Secondly, Hierocles’ text has been preserved by Photius, Patriarch of  Constantinople in the ninth century (ed. Bekker, p. 171 and 460, Hierocles’ Treatise on  Providence ).  The nature of this testimony is vaguer and less suspect.  Ammonius  brought the principle that serves as a rule, that the truth about the nature of things is  entirely contained in the purified doctrine of Plato, έν τῇ  Πλάτωνoς,  which is a view  commonly shared by Plotinus, Origen, Porphyry, Iamblichus and Plutarch.  To him, the  Platonists and Aristotelians exaggerated the differences between the two systems, and  these discussions continued up to Ammonius the Theodidact. </p><div id="pagenum"><p>367</p></div><p id="page">5   It seems that in the eyes of the tradition Ammonius was the great conciliator of  the systems of Plato and Aristotle.  As for the purification spoken of here, we do not  know what to say.  If Ammonius [p.21] demonstrated the concordance of the two  philosophers, it was probably in some way, an interpretation of Plato.  Note that we  find this fusion internally in Plotinus, though externally the similarity with Aristotle is  much more striking than with Plato10.  Kirchner has said that Plotinus is a neo- Aristotelian, not a Neoplatonist.  It is an exaggeration and a mistake.  But we must  remember that there is a fusion of the two philosophers with him.  So, he would only  have borrowed it from his master; the method would have been one of fusion, the idea  that Aristotle and Plato were basically in agreement, in a word, faith in a philosophy  that is always basically the same, taught initially by the first philosophers, then  consciously by Plato, then, a little distorted by Aristotle.  This interpretation is  confirmed by the single testimony of Porphyry: “In his examinations Plotinus brought  the mind of Ammonius to bear on the investigations in hand” ( Life of Plotinus  S 14),  and after having said that: “His writings are full of concealed Stoic and Peripatetic  doctrines.  Aristotle’s Metaphysics  in particular is concentrated in them.”   We have no reason to attribute the great ideas of Plotinus’ philosophy to  Ammonius.  It seems difficult to see him as the creator of Alexandrian philosophy.  The  truth seems to have been that this school formed the thought of Plotinus.   For ten years, he contented himself with orally teaching the pure and simple  teaching of Ammonius.  Was this doctrine a more intimate relationship with a method  outside of the Enneads?  The silence of Plotinus, Porphyry and others reminds us that  Plotinus was the creator of the doctrine in its general theses.  What he was able to take  from elsewhere, is material that has worked.  His originality is of having made a great  effort of inner concentration which could only be borrowed from elsewhere.   He was thirty-nine years old when he followed the Emperor Gordian against the  Persians, to study philosophy in Persia and India.  He and Gordian were only able to  make it, and not without difficulty, to Antioch11.  The question arises as to how he  could know the philosophies of the East, which some say he would have borrowed.   The East can be understood as Persia or India, or finally Egypt. [p.22] However, in  terms of India, there is no reference made in the Enneads and there is no reason to  believe that he knew anything of these doctrines.  As for Persia, he had the curiosity to  go, but he did not succeed, and we have no reason to suppose that even in Alexandria </p><div id="pagenum"><p>368</p></div><p id="page">6   he became acquainted with Persian philosophy.  Now, we find no trace of emanation in  him; he even disputes this Gnostic theory.   There remained Egypt.  There is no evidence that he has deepened the  monuments of Egyptian wisdom.  Egypt comes up once, in Ennead, V.8.6: in this text,  he refers to the Egyptian and symbolic hieroglyphic characters.  He merely said that the  Egyptians found a way to represent things instead of only designating sounds.  This  reference has no philosophical character except a word on which it is necessary to  return.   Eastern influence on Plotinus will therefore only be accepted if we discern in  him something that is explained neither by Greek philosophy nor from Plotinus’ roots.  < 13 > There is a text on Egypt in V.8.6:  “The sages of Egyptians either receiving an exact science, or through some innate  instinct, about the things they wanted to communicate, seem wise not to have been  content with borrowing letters which trace words and their order, nor which mimic the  sounds and utterances of opinions; but having drawn images and having each one  engraved in pictures in their temples, and they showed the composition of each of these  images, in such a way that each image is also a science and a wisdom, and a wisdom  that is found underlying this inscription which is picked up, being neither a science nor  discursive reflection.”  These are purely ideographic hieroglyphs.  Plotinus said that there is a profound  <14> way of speaking, of indicating ideas.  It was intuition, not thinking: the wisdom in  words was picked up immediately.  But it is not a question of Egyptian beliefs, solely  their symbolism.  It therefore seems unlikely that Plotinus was influenced by them.  [p.23] Thus, for him, there is no trace of any influence other than Greek.  If studying  his philosophy leads us to believe that everything about him is explained by earlier  Greek philosophy, or by his own genius, we can say that he is purely a Greek  philosopher.  At most he has suffered from an ambient impact in his style which is a bit  relaxed and rambling.   Upon his return from Asia he settled in Rome for forty years.  He opened a  school and its teaching had considerable success.  It would have been interesting to stop  at this time to study the environment in which his philosophy fully developed, to see  the enthusiasm it aroused, and the influence it had, especially on women, such as the  two Geminas mentioned by Porphyry.  According to Porphyry, the emperor Galen and  his wife Salonina admired him so much that they planned to turn for him a ruined city </p><div id="pagenum"><p>369</p></div><p id="page">7   in Campania into “Platonopolis” which would be governed according to the Laws of  Plato.  According to Porphyry it did not happen because of the jealousy of the courtiers.  Hegel (History of Philosophy, IIIrd Century ) considered it to be contrary to common  sense12.    The influence of Plotinus was considerable.  Porphyry cites several anecdotes.  Rogalianus, a senator who attended his lectures, relinquished so many things in life; he  renounced his property, his servants and dignities, and ate only every other day - this  cured his gout.   Two characters stand out in from Plotinus’ entourage <16>: Amelius and  Porphyry.  Amelius13 came from Etruria.  He wanted to be called Amerius (a pun on the  name Αμερία, which evokes the meaning of indivisible divine nature, while the name  Amelius means negligence, ἀμέλεια).  He came to Rome in 246, became attached to  Plotinus and was close to him for twenty-three years.  At the instigation of Plotinus, he  wrote forty books against the Gnostic Zostrien.  He also defended Plotinus against  those who claimed that he had appropriated the ideas of the neo-Pythagorean Numenius  (evidence that Plotinus knew Numenius, and through him, Philo).  Amelius seemed to  have had a mediocre mind and was an applied and passive disciple.  Porphyry is a philosopher.  In his biography of Plotinus, he provides details about  himself.  He claims himself to be Tyrian. St. Jerome refers to him as a native of  Balanea, Syria, but his own testimony is preferable.  He calls [p.24] himself called  Malchus, which means ‘the king’ in Syrian.  It was Amelius <77> who translated this  word for Porphyry.  He came to Rome around 254 and became attached to Plotinus;  however, no one seems to have understood him as well.  He lived with him for six  years.  Among other things to come before us, is a small treatise, ἀφορμαὶ πρὸς τὰ  νοτἁ, consisting of a collection of comments on some passages from the Enneads.  In it,  we find a brief summary of Plotinus’ key points, which is of an extraordinary  penetration.  Porphyry had a somewhat original mind but was capable of deeply  entering into the thoughts of others.   In his school14 they read the works of the Platonists and Peripatetics.  After this  reading and a short meditation, Plotinus expounded his thoughts.  There was much  discussion, and Plotinus spoke eloquently without correction.  It is undoubtedly from  these discussions on a wide variety of subjects that Plotinus’ doctrine gradually  emerged.  For ten years he did nothing but develop Ammonius’ ideas <18>, most likely </p><div id="pagenum"><p>370</p></div><p id="page">8   commenting on Plato and Aristotle and combining them.  He only began to write at the  age of fifty, and he wrote as he spoke, beginning with questions.  According to  Porphyry, he wrote fifty-four treatises and passed on to us everything he experienced15.    Plotinus not only inspired admiration, but he appeared to his circle to be a  supernatural being, most likely because he applied the same insight to practical matters  as he did in his writing16.  Porphyry thought about suicide, and on realising, Plotinus  and ordered him to make a journey that healed him.  Porphyry even attributed him with  the power to break magic spells.  An Egyptian priest propositioned him to evoke a  demon, and it was a god who appeared, because it was indeed a god who accompanied  him.  On being invited to attend a sacrifice, he said: “It is for the gods to come to me.”17  There is no doubt <19> that Plotinus felt he was in contact with the divine.  He  experienced ecstasy, and during the six years that Porphyry was with him, Plotinus  experienced it four times.   Plotinus' last words were: “I am trying hard to bring together what is divine in  me and what is divine in the universe.”18  <20>    [p.25] II.  The Work and Bibliography of Plotinus  <21>   (i) Plotinus’ Work  – The Enneads    Porphyry tells us that Plotinus began to write after lengthy meditation and wrote  without stopping or re-reading.  His style has the master qualities of a great writer.   Porphyry and Longinus have honoured him. In §14 of his Life of Plotinus  Porphyry  states that: “His style was quick, full of ideas, concise and more abundant in thoughts  than words, often speaking with passion and inspiration”.  Longinus, at the end of §19  in the same work says that: “I extremely admire and love his writing style, for the  multitude eager for the thoughts of this man and for the philosophical nature of his  enquiries, and I think that researchers have to place his books among the most  remarkable.”  That's All.  But the detail is overlooked.  The syntax is completely  incorrect.  The development lacks continuity.  There are <22> tangled phrases.  It is a  style that notes perceptions.  In the Lives of Sophists , p.9, Eunapius19, says that Plotinus  is remarkable for the enigmatic character of his speeches, which are laborious and  difficult. </p><div id="pagenum"><p>371</p></div><p id="page">9   This explains the difficulties of the text.  Porphyry was its editor, at least  principally.  Eustochius, Plotinus’ doctor made a compilation of his writings in a  slightly different order.  Some of Plotinus’ manuscripts, in which the material is  presented differently, are attributed to Eustochius.  The tradition was therefore  preserved.  We only have the edition of Porphyry.  According to him, Plotinus left fifty-four treaties which are provided in the  chronological order in which it was written.  Instead of maintaining it, he followed the  example used by Andronicus for Aristotle and Theophrastus; he grouped together the  books of related subjects.  He composed groups [p.26] in which he went from the easier  to the more difficult and generally <23> the shortest to longest.  He formed six novenas  and was pleased that he encountered two perfect numbers.  Actually, he considered it  lucky and this is probably why he separated certain chapters of some treatises.  For  example, the ninth treatise of Book 1, ‘Suicide’, is very short and was most likely taken  from another treatise; or VI, a brief summary of no importance20.  There are sometimes  two or three consecutive books continued under the same title.  Porphyry probably  made these divisions.  Example:  Ennead IV.3, 4 and 5.  Finally, it is true that Ennead I  is primarily moral; II and III are primarily about the physical; the IVth deals with the  Soul; the Vth Intellect and the intelligible; the VIth, the One and the categories of  being.  This rigorous distinction had to me made.  There is no important book where we  more or less find his complete system.   As a matter of fact, the mode of Porphyry’s’ classification is arbitrary and  furthermore Porphyry left a list of these treaties that may be in chronological order.  Only Kirchhof has returned <24> to this so-called chronological order.  Mueller and  Volkmann have returned to the order of the Enneads.  There are reasons; probably:  1.   The chronological order is of no interest.  There is no trace of a development  with Plotinus.  The reason is probably that he wrote later.  2.   I would add that the order may not be chronological.  Porphyry simply says  that twenty-one of these treatises were already written when he came to Plotinus, and  he gives a list.  He adds that he composed twenty-four books when he was with him  and names them.  Finally, the nine other treatises were composed after the departure of  Porphyry.  It is quite likely, but not certain, that this list is chronological.  <25>     </p><div id="pagenum"><p>372</p></div><p id="page">10   3. Bibliography    Plotinus’ text came to us in very poor condition.  The manuscripts are quite numerous,  but riddled with errors.  None goes beyond the 13th century and many are much later.   Mueller has described [p.27] thirty-nine manuscripts of Plotinus and declares that only  a sixth deserves some consideration (cf. Mueller, Hermès, t. 14, 1879).  The best is  Mediceus A .   The first edition is from Basel, 1580.  A century before the Latin translation of  Marsilio Ficino appeared, with commentary used by all subsequent editors.  The  commentary mainly consists of comparisons with Plotinus’ successors.  The Basel  edition was reproduced in 1615.  The text was very defective and almost unreadable.   The following edition is that of Oxford, 1835, Plotini Opera Omnia , by Kreuzer  and Moser; a wonder of typography.  The text is very defective; the edition was done  with the utmost lightness and riddled with misprints.  Ficino's translation is reproduced,  and his <26> commentary arranged.   Then, Paris, 1855, with the Latin translation of Ficino, edited by Dubner, in the  "Didot" collection.  It roughly reproduces the previous, but the punctuation was given  attention.   The next editor, Kirchof, whose edition of 1855 is in the "Teubner" collection,  was harsh on his predecessors.  It is the first decent text presented of Plotinus.  It  presents a grouping after the order indicated by Porphyry in his Life of Plotinus .   In 1876 a series of important remarks by Vintringam appeared which were used  by editions that followed.   Hermann Friedrich Mueller, 1878, Werdman.  The text, which is quite good, is  based on a methodical classification of the manuscripts.   Finally, Volkmann, 1883 Teubner.  The text is similar to that of Mueller, but it  is more prudent in the rejection of the glosses assumed by Mueller.  This is the best  edition.   Let us quote the publications separated from the books περὶ τοῦ καλοῦ [On  Beauty], I, 6; περὶ τοῦ <27> νοητοῦ κἀλλους [On Intelligible Beauty]; Against the  Gnostics23, II, 9.   There is a French translation of Bouillet, 1857-1861, in three volumes, with  comments and notes - largely from Marsilio Ficino.  It is less a translation than a  paraphrase. </p><div id="pagenum"><p>373</p></div><p id="page">11    In German, Engelhardt, translator of the second Ennead.   Translation completed by Mueller, 1878-1880 'Berlin, the first volume being  better than the second.    [p.28] In English, Taylor has translated excerpts from Plotinus.

Not to mention the detailed work on the books on ‘On the Beautiful’ and ‘Against the  Gnostics’.  <29>    4. The Doctrine of Plotinus  The Place of the Theory of the Soul Therein    <30>  Plotinus came to Alexandria in the 111th century of our era.  It was a time of  intellectual eclecticism and vague moralism, pagan religion, Greek spirited, deeply  attached to classical culture, and having a background that was contemptuous of  Eastern imports, he naturally tended to resist this foreign invasion by combining the  forces of the whole of Greek philosophy; not by process of juxtaposition, but digging  so deeply beneath the ideas he brought forth the source from which these ideas had  sprung25.  </p><div id="pagenum"><p>374</p></div><p id="page">12   It would be interesting to follow this philosophy in its struggle with Christianity,  especially to ask why this philosophy and this religion that had so much in common,  immediately found themselves irreconcilable enemies, and why it was that it was this  philosophy that died.  It would also be necessary to find out how this religion, after the  triumph of philosophy, absorbed, and retained the best of it (St. Basil, Augustine),  <31> and how this thinking now has a somewhat important role in modern thought.  I shall limit my examination of the philosophy of Plotinus to its central part, the theory  of the Soul26 that is concurrently the theory of the individual soul and the Universal  soul.  The course will show that it is the centre of this philosophy; but as there is no  special book devoted to this theory it will be helpful to present it, and following the  method of Plotinus, to start with a presentation of the complete preliminary and  schematic doctrine of Plotinus.   The starting point of Plato’s dialectic of was the spectacle of contradictions of  which material things are the theatre, Republic, VII27.  In the presence of contradictions  presented by the subject matter, the philosopher is encouraged to reflect, and he  concludes that the things we perceive are only appearances, and that reality must be  sought in the immutable ideas.  Above all Plotinus seems <32> to have been struck by the contradictions of  human affairs ( Enneads, III)28.  The things we hold to be serious or even tragic, wars,  etc.., all this is child's play, banter.  It is not the man inside but a shadow of the man  who is engaged here below with lamentations and groans.  The evidence is in the same  regularity of physical evil, the rhythm of a Pyrrhic dance.  We are spectators.  We must understand each of the actors; follow the lines of the world in all its  articulations.  The analysis with which the Platonic dialectic begins consists in  determining reality as qualities, the mixture of which specifically engenders  contradictions.  According to Plotinus, it is in living beings [p.30] that this analysis  ends, Ennead VI 29.  A stone must be put back into the earth (ground), and we will see  that the earth is an animated being, and so for all elements.  <33> What is a living being?  A microcosm of the world order.  It is divided, but  in each part is the whole.  It goes through phases, or each is implied in the other.  It is  therefore a principle that unites the multiplicity; it is the λόγoς έν σπέρματι, the  generative reason.   Logos is less than an idea, because it works, more than a thing because a thing  is inert.  It is a "function", an idea that moves; a thought in motion. </p><div id="pagenum"><p>375</p></div><p id="page">13    Let us then consider all living beings formed by the work of the generative  reasons.  Each one of them manifests a logos and the same time a certain love of life;  hence selfishness and struggle.  But at the same time that all living beings are  struggling together, we are also witness to a concert.  A fundamental harmony is  revealed30.  In addition to individual logoi, there is a universal logos of the body of the  entire world.   <34> Proofs: 1. ---- If astrology can guess the events in the sky, it is not because  of the influence of the stars on destinies, but that there is such conspiracy of everything  that arrangement or disturbance has repercussions elsewhere.  Astrology reveals the  fundamental harmony of all things.  2. ---- Magic, by acting at a distance produces certain modifications of matter.  3. ---- Love, which has something of the magician.  The real affinities of things, which  reveal themselves in magic, also appear in love.  And also in music.  So, there is a harmony of all things and a universal logos.  But what explains the  agreement of individual logoi with the reason of the whole?  This point has been poorly  addressed by most interpreters.  Suffice it for now to note this agreement.  In addition,  we must consider the individual reasons to be placed <35> on the same plane as  universal reason, coordinated with it, emanating from it.   It is appropriate to consider the point or aim of these logoi.  These reasons  succeed in shaping living bodies, that is systems of forces [p.31] or qualities organised  them.  The more the logos works, the more it divides itself.  It deposits more and more  forms which it maintained united within it and also distends in space and time.  What  was undivided in it unfolds, thereby constituting bodies and living beings.   What is his point of departure? The work is < >31.  Therefore, his point of  departure is an idea that does not work; a Platonic idea.  Only, for Plotinus, the idea  represents an individual object.  Therefore, the immobile ideas are what we find at the  other extreme from the logos.  The ideas are above, the body below; and stretched  between them, the beam of the beams of guiding ideas.  However, we are still neither at  the base nor at the summit.  <36> Plotinus says that if we represent reality as a cone,  ideas are a section closer to the point of the cone, forms a section closer to the base.   The forms require a support, a matter, initially to account for their reciprocal  action, then to explain their gradual decline; because when the form acts, it is  weakened.  One should not seek to define matter, which would be to give it a form; and </p><div id="pagenum"><p>376</p></div><p id="page">14   the hypothesis is that it has no forms.  It is a phantom which lies about all that it claims  to be; it is the deprivation of any form, of any link, infinity [indefinite], άπειρον.    Must we actually conclude that there is a principle really distinct from the form  which is mixed with it?  No, because this expression, matter, is entirely provisional.   We can regard it as the exhaustion of the reasons as they move away from their starting  point.  A divergent cone of light into the darkness, <37> for the divergent rays never  cease to weaken.  Matter is a limit that is never reached.   Now go back up to the other end, the Ideas, immobile essences.  These Ideas are  much more than the reasons themselves, being neither in space nor in time: they are  cast into each other and represent each other.  However, there is an Idea which is more  than any other representation of the whole, it is the universal logos: the νοῦς.  This idea  is not substantially different from the others; it is under it that the others are  coordinated.  Yet it is not pure unity; it contains a multiplicity.  [p.32] Above, there was therefore pure unity.  How can it be defined?  We can give no  name worthy of it.  It is superior to all determination.  Compared with being, it is more  than being, and is more than thought.  If the ideas are <38> causes of objects, it is cause  of cause.  If it must be named it is τό έν [the One], τό αύταρχες [the authoritarian], τό  πρώτον [the first], τό ύπέρτατον [the ultimate]; but it is still άπειρον [the  infinite/indefinite].  Here we are between the less than infinite being and the infinite more than being.  It is between these two infinities that we find the chain of existences stretched.  At the  top, that which is more than light, then the luminous point, the unity of a point which  shines, but encompasses all the light rays which diverge, and finally all these rays  diverge more and more, losing themselves in the darkness [obscurity].   This third hypostasis is the Soul.  The Soul <39> is a mixture.  We should say  that there is initially the idea, then reason, then form and then matter.  Soul is Idea at  the top; it is within the Ideas and can return; it is logos in the middle, then form and  matter at the base.  Consider the idea par excellence, νοῦς.  If we think the intelligible, we think the  same intelligible last, working by distension.  This is the World Soul.  It is the thought  that overflows, which overwhelms itself by distraction.  Then the World Soul will  produce the body of the world, that is, to sketch out possible living bodies.  But then each of the particular ideas, which also virtually contain a soul, is  extended by its logos towards the body that universal reason has prepared for it.  Each </p><div id="pagenum"><p>377</p></div><p id="page">15   of the particular souls contained in each <40> of the particular ideas, perceiving the  body that the universal logos has only sketched as its image, is fascinated by this  image.  And, seduced at the idea of being something separated from everything in space  and time, it drops; hence the fall. The soul is then taken into the body, into this great  phantasmagoria that is the material world. [p.33] It takes this phantasmagoria seriously.   It could always return to God who is its father; but more often it takes reality for that  which is merely the shadow of reality and becomes an actress in the drama unfolding  before our eyes.   So, we came back to our starting point.  We know how to produce the  hypostases. I would now like to eliminate from Plotinus’ doctrine the ideas which do  not belong exclusively to him.   Initially at the two ends, we have the One, superior in essence and thought,  <41> and matter lower than them both.  We can recognise there the frustration of the  two principles of Aristotle, form and matter, the latter having become less than power.   Similarly, one could bring closer the One of Plotinus to the One of Plato, and its nature  is similar to the indefinite principle of which Plato speaks.  The resemblance is obvious  when one considers the principles at rest; much less when you consider the route that  goes from one to the other.  There is a very particular irradiation.  Nevertheless, let us  eliminate these two terms.  There remains the logoi and Ideas. The logoi are similar to those of the Stoics, the  Ideas are Plato’s.  But the difference is great, especially in the transition from one to  another.  The Stoic logoi are immanent in matter, not derived from a transcendent  principle.  The Ideas of Plato are the genres [kinds].  Instead, Plotinus’ logoi are only  the prolongations of ideas; and the ideas themselves <42>, being individual, are all  prepared to live again in the logoi.  Therefore, what exclusively belongs to Plotinus is  the passage, the effort to overcome dualism latent in his predecessors.  If we take the Ideas and the One, we have the intelligible world of Plato and  Aristotle; and the sensible world below it.  Plotinus wants to derive one of the worlds  from the other, passing the ideas across with logos, from Noûs to the psyche.  That is  his great originality.  And how he is able to represent this transition?  The material world is the world  of action and production; the world of Ideas is that of contemplation.  The question then  is: how do we pass from speculation to action?  What is outside of space and time that  distends and degenerates?  Plotinus has resolved the question psychologically [p.34] by </p><div id="pagenum"><p>378</p></div><p id="page">16   trying to make the transition from the purely intelligible to the purely analytically  sensible by bringing simple decay to it <43>.  See Ennead III where he declares that  action and production are a weakening of the speculation33.  Action for the one that acts  is to weaken the thought; it is to be relaxed.  Like the geometrician who inadvertently  draws a figure while he is thinking intensely, pure contemplation weakens during  action.  Here therefore is what there is of capital in the idea of irradiation, and which he  tried to extend to all the transitions between hypostases.     His idea is again more psychological.  This idea is not a simple thesis to which  we can oppose others: it is a fact, an observation.  In Ennead IV34 he describes the  condition found when, waking from his body, he became conscious, and then had a  vision of a wonderfully beautiful world, beside which the rest was a dream.  The body  is sleeping, and action, of which the body is the instrument, is a decrease of  contemplation; it is the mind <44> that sleeps.   Ecstasy is only an extension of this much more scientific state that consists in  passing from the sphere of the Soul to the intelligible.  His metaphysical method is deep  introspection, which consists in going beyond the ideas by a profound appeal to  sympathy between our soul and the whole of reality.  Ecstasy is a form of sympathy,  but not the only one35.  From below it is the effort by which the soul elevates itself to  νοῦς and according to VI. 7, from well below; a very special state at which one must  arrive if one wants to represent oneself materially.  You cannot think it, but you can  place yourself in a state of ἃνοια [folly] which is in sympathy with what in reality is  truly non-being.  So, there are several attitudes of the soul that seek to coincide with  what is not strictly thought.  <45> His method is psychological.  And then it is natural that his attention was  called, more than Aristotle, to psychology, the life of the Soul.  Plotinus considers the  maxim of Socrates as being scientific36.  He says in VI that the Soul is representative of  everything; that of knowing one knows everything.  His successors have clearly  understood this.  In a fragment of a treatise sent by Iamblichus to Porphyry on the  subject of γνῶθι σεαυτόν [know thyself], it is stated that he who knows the Soul knows  the essence of things37.  [p.35] Similarly Proclus, in his Commentary on Alcibiades , and  also in the Timaeus, says that knowing the Soul is to know everything and to rise to  God38.     </p><div id="pagenum"><p>379</p></div><p id="page">17   <46>  5. Plotinus’ Interpretation of Plato     <47> We will discuss the relationship between Plotinus’ philosophy and  previous philosophies.   That Plotinus extracted key ideas from previous philosophies emerges from a  cursory reading of the Enneads.  Porphyry says that theories of the Stoics and  Peripatetics are interspersed in his writings and that during Plotinus’ lectures all the  philosophers were read, especially the commentators of Plato.     Secondly, it is also indisputable that of the earlier philosophies to which he  made all others measure up is the philosophy of Plato.  Kirchner claims that he was  inspired by Aristotle much more than Plato, but he acknowledges that he uses  Aristotle’s interpretation of Plato.  Of the rest, Plotinus mentions many Greek  philosophers and constantly criticises them.  He would happily inspire men with the  early philosophers.  Nevertheless, he <48> reproaches Heraclitus for forgetting to be  clear40; Empedocles for having grossly mistaken the nature of elements by making  them material, that is, destructible41; Anaxagoras, for having introduced the νοῦς, but  failing to take advantage of it42, since he puts all the forms in the primitive μίγμα  [mixture]  and renders νοῦς unnecessary; the Pythagoreans for having made substantial  numbers.  He attacked Aristotle on all the essential points: the theory of the entelechy  of the soul, IV43, he likened to materialist theory - the theory of categories, VI. I - the  theory of God (having put thought at the top is a big mistake, all thought is  conversation toward something), V44.  The same applies to the Stoics; he criticizes their  conception of the soul, their theory of categories, etc.  There is a philosopher against  whom he has never even directed an objection of detail: Plato.   [p.36]  Plato is the divine philosopher, the master that he does not even need to  name when quoting.  Plotinus puts all <49> his key ideas in Plato’s name.  He does not  even admit his differences with him; of spiriting them away; of saying that Plato  concealed his thoughts behind images.  At the beginning of the Vth Ennead, he declares  himself to be only an “interpreter" of Platonic philosophy45.  Interpreting Plato, and in  the light of this interpretation, collecting what is best in all of Greek philosophy is what  Plotinus wanted to do.   But this interpretation of Plato is very new and different from that of Aristotle  and his successors.  The novelty of this interpretation characterises the time of Plotinus, </p><div id="pagenum"><p>380</p></div><p id="page">18   the post-Platonic influences he was subject to, the idea that it consisted of Greek  philosophy in general, especially his personal originality.  What is this interpretation?   There are two parts at work in the dialogues of Plato: 1. - The aspect which  strikes us most is the dialectical aspect 46, the theory of Ideas.  It is built entirely <50>  using a dual method of analysis and synthesis; notably, analysis is the dialectic.  The  philosopher shares contradictions that he notices in sensation as an assemblage of  opposite qualities.  He separates these qualities and perceiving in each the shadow of an  immutable essence he studies the other side of these essences instead of looking for  their affinities; their parent, their filiation.  In restoring the true order, arranges the  Ideas in a hierarchical series up to the super essence to which all the essences owe their  clarity and existence.  2. - A second aspect of this philosophy is the myth.  Myths are common in Plato.   They are of a very diverse nature and importance.  a) Some are obviously only more or  less prolonged poetic images - for example, in the Phaedrus47men charmed by the  muses become cicadas; or in Republic48, III, the metals that are used to form souls.  b)  The more significant myths: allegories that can be easily translated, for example, within  the Phaedrus49, the comparison of the soul to a chariot drawn by two horses.  These are  only <51> that of imaginative play.  But next to these accidental myths in the  philosophy, there are some that are essential because [p.37] without them the  philosophy of Plato would be something other than it is.   Firstly, they are recognized by their extent ( Republic, X, and the great myth of  Phaedrus , the myth of the Phaedo); secondly by their tone:  he is more serious, more  personal; it seems that Plato wants to introduce us to some mystery; thirdly, a less  general feature, Plato puts his myths in the mouth of a foreigner or a Pythagorean, or at  least there will be Pythagoreans in the dialogue (Er the Armenian, Diotima, Timaeus…)    These are the external features.   Here are the essential internal, features.  If we compare these myths, we shall  see that the subject which occupies the centre is always the soul, and particularly the  human soul.  There are often cosmogonical details surrounding it, but it is oriented  towards the soul, and to the theological relation to the human soul.  In Republic X,  <52> Er saw the resurrected souls of the wicked punished and the good rewarded.  He  saw the necessity of the spindle, and the eight rings with eight Sirens.  Phaedo: after  death the souls of men are escorted to their respective place of residence and the land is  described from the view of the soul.  In both myths, it is the destiny of the soul after </p><div id="pagenum"><p>381</p></div><p id="page">19   death, while in others, it is the soul before life ( Phaedrus : human souls chasing divine  souls; Protagoras : the gods forming mortal souls).   For the life of the soul itself, as distinct from the contemplation of Ideas, as it is  impelled to recollection and love, recollection and love are still presented mythically:  love (Phaedrus, Banquet ) recollection ( Meno, where we find mythical expressions).   Finally, in the Timaeus, it is the formation of the world soul and, symmetrically, of  human souls, and around cosmogonic details.   So, the becoming of the soul and <53> generally becoming in general, but  oriented towards the becoming of the soul - these are the subjects of Plato’s myths.   But why does Plato treat these subjects in the form of myth?  It seems that he  had no other form at its disposal, because outside of it was only the form of dialectic;  but the essence of the dialectic is precisely to take change and solve it in forms that do  not change.  [p.38]  It is a static mode of explanation: it is in short, analysis.  Becoming  as becoming, remains by hypothesis outside of a dialectical explanation50.    Therefore, becoming remains outside - and yet it is something; Plato is not an  Eleatic.  He admits the reality of change.  Change exists, but it is not an object of  thought.  He had to find a way of explanation, or rather expression, casting becoming,  as a participant of being and non-being, of <54> truth and falsehood.   In summary, if we depart from things, we can go back to the Ideas via the  dialectic, from inferior to superior ideas, hence to the Good.  If we assume the Good  and descend to Ideas, but especially to sensible things, no scientific explanation will  account for this process, by hypothesis, and this is where the myth comes in.  When  using the Alexandrian terms πρόοδος and έπιστροφή [procession and reversion]  in  Platonic philosophy, reversion is explained by dialectics and procession in mythical  terms.   These are two very different aspects of Platonism.  From a philosophical point  of view, these two aspects do not have with the same resilient strength.  The dialectical  element addresses the general and impersonal faculty of conceiving and reasoning;  myth the personal whim of each of us: everyone can interpret it in his own way.  It  amounts to <55> an approximate kind that keeps a certain subjectivity alongside  impersonal science.    These two elements are, one absolutely stable, the other unstable according to  the individual.  The theory of Ideas, easily expressible in words, necessarily had to  move around the other, something very personal, and that is what happened.  Aristotle </p><div id="pagenum"><p>382</p></div><p id="page">20   immediately ignores this mythical element of the Platonic philosophy, and that is why  he perceived no transition of the intelligible to the sensible; he therefore made the Idea  descend into things.  And this interpretation has remained the traditional interpretation:  Plato remains foremost the philosopher of the theory of Ideas.   In his theory of the soul there is something that shocks anyone presenting the  systematic explanation of the ideas of Plato.  In some works they resolve to throw  overboard anything not in accordance with that theory.  [p.39]  It is commonly said that  anything that is not the theory of Ideas should not be taken seriously51. <56>   Philosophers they met took these myths seriously and put the mythical  philosophy of Plato in the same rank as the other.  It was natural that it occurred in a  religious environment where all the religions were in conflict.  It is also understandable  that Plotinus was struck by the explanation that Plato made certain ideas mythological  as a matter of fact; it is also understandable that he sought a justification of paganism  and that precisely for this reason, he attributed paramount importance to this  philosophy and interpreted all Greek philosophies in the light of that one.   At this time, the inner life became intense.  Inside, all new shades of feelings  came to the light of day.  They were more prepared to seek a path of truth on the side of  the idea.  Finally, the idea of having to enter the myth by a route other than reason was  no longer shocking.   <57>  In Plotinus’ philosophy, I see primarily an effort to recapture Platonism  in its entirety.  Plotinus wholly accepts Platonic dialectic, and even puts something  beyond the Ideas that is more than Idea and which we can reach.  But he also accepts  the Platonic theory of the origin of souls, their descent into the body, love and  recollection, and the destiny of souls.   How has he reconciled the two aspects?  By a compromise that has rendered the  mythology more dialectical and the dialectic more mythological.   1.- Consider the myths.  In a passage at the end of Ennead, IV.252, Plotinus  again calls us back to the theory of the relationship between ψυχή [soul] and νοῦς  [nous], and more particularly of the soul located in space and time, and the soul located  in the intelligible.  And he ends the exposition by providing an interpretation of the  Timaeus. <58>  He quotes a sentence from the Timaeus53, where reference is  made to a mixture of indivisible essence and divisible essence, made by God to form  the soul. Plato presents this mixture as a historical fact.  However, according to  Plotinus, the doctrine is not something different to his, and yet, the relationship of the </p><div id="pagenum"><p>383</p></div><p id="page">21   soul to the intelligible in Plotinus is metaphysical in nature: it is not that of an artist's  work, but a metaphysical derivation.  Placing νοῦς with the Soul following.  Thus, in  the Timaeus, there is a history [p.40] that happens with the characters in time, while  being wholly contingent54.  In Plotinus, the process is timeless and metaphysical.  Yet  Plotinus provides this theory as that of the Timaeus.   Is it a coincidence or {a} method of interpretation?  Plotinus provides in III, an  interpretation of myths.  He says that myths must divide in time what they say, and they  separate from each other <59> many things that are given one within another but which  differ in rank and powers.  When they have taught what they can teach, they leave to  him who represented them the task of making the synthesis55.  So, the role of the myth  is to present in the form of a story in time, what in itself is a necessity of being.   Example: the origin of souls and their descent.   Initially souls exist by themselves and are invariable.  But this means that the  body is not that which receives the soul, it is the body which is in the soul as one that it  is representing.  And, as such, it is there after a fashion, from all eternity.   For successive existences, each having rewards and punishments - all these  successive existences are complementary to each other and all together form something  that is other than the idea of the soul.   <60>  So, Plotinus considered a timeless process that is given in myth as a  history.  This amounts to saying that this interpretation implies a certain conception of  time and of a relationship of time with the eternal.  Because if the same reality, which is  viewed on one side as a succession in time and on the other as given suddenly in  eternity, it could only be because time is the development of the successive form of  something which in itself is timeless.  Ennead III, 7 (περὶ αἰῶνος καὶ χρόνου) [On  Eternity and Time] expresses this theory of time.  Time is to eternity as the Soul is to  νοῦς.  The mind, νοῦς, is eternal.   If the Soul is identical in itself and outside of νοῦς,  time in the Soul is the movement, the life of the Soul as it passes from act to act, from  state to state.  Once posited, the interpretation of Platonic myths is deduced from this  theory, because these myths relate to the soul, and what is becoming in the soul  coincides with the eternal.  [p.41]  So, we see how the myth coincides to some extent  with the dialectic.   2. - Similarly, the dialectic of Plotinus has something more mythical.  It is also  more abstract.  For Plato, the soul that rises to the contemplation of Ideas comes out of  itself, and the Idea is something rather distant from the soul: it represents a kind, the </p><div id="pagenum"><p>384</p></div><p id="page">22   soul is individual.  For Plotinus, many ideas are individual.  There is an Idea of  Socrates that is in the eternal, the same Socrates who, developed over time is the soul.  Thus, the soul enters the region of Ideas.  The importance attributed by Plotinus to  psychological studies comes largely from the established link between the soul and the  intelligible, the soul being, as one that goes back up, plunging into the Idea.  The idea  of a science of the individual is of paramount <62> importance in the philosophy of  Plotinus56.   So, whether we consider the doctrine of Plotinus in itself, or as an interpretation  of Plato, we are brought back to the study of the Soul as its centre.    V – The World Soul     <63>  Firstly, we have to speak about the World Soul.  According to Plotinus  the theory of the particular soul and the Universal Soul are constantly intertwined.  The  idea of starting with a study of the World Soul and giving the psychology of the  universe as an introduction to the psychology of the individual, is less strange than it  seems if one relates to the meaning that the ancients, and especially Plotinus, have  given to these words: ψυχή τοῦ παντός [Universal Soul].  This is the principle of order  and nature, which creates matter and the laws of matter.  In proceeding this way, we  simply deal with nature in general before the conscious mind; we put consciousness  into the conditions of life before dealing with the question of consciousness: it is  basically the modern approach57.  The question of the relation between the physical and  the moral is the same issue as that of the relation between the Universal Soul and the  individual soul58.   [p.42]  Plotinus <64> drew very special conclusions from this general  statement, as well as the theory of physical heredity.  He explains it by determining  precisely the responsibility of the Universal Soul and that of the individual soul,  sketching the body and so bestowing it with general, transmissible characters, and  therefore hereditary.  The individual soul intervenes and perfects this work.  Moreover,  it chooses a certain body because it is suitable, and adapts itself to it.  The problem of  ‘being’ posed in ancient form is solved in a rather modern form.   The question of a Universal Soul is not as strange one would think.  We accept  that there is a certain unity of nature; finalists see in the development of things the </p><div id="pagenum"><p>385</p></div><p id="page">23   development of a single idea; their opponents accept the unfolding of a great  mechanical theorem.  The unity beneath this double form veils that the World Soul  explained in concrete form59.   But what is the origin of this terminology that equates the unity of the whole to  that of the Soul?  Probably Pythagorean; although there are no specific texts.  The only  quote of Philolaus by Stobaeus, is inauthentic60; but other texts attribute to the  Pythagoreans certain ideas that, synthesised in the mind, had to be translated within the  specific conception of a Universal Soul.   Aristotle, Physics, N, 2b [=213b23].  “For the Pythagoreans the sky is,  surrounded by empty space, and the world breathes."  The world was a living being for  them; but was there a centre of life?   Stobaeus, Philosophical Extracts (Eclogae philosophorum ) 1.488. “Philolaus  put fire at the centre. This fire was called the home of the universe and even the home  of Zeus and the mother of the gods".  It is indeed a matter of centre.  Is it a Soul?   Aristotle, Metaphysics , 986 a2. “The whole world is harmony and number”.   But for the Pythagoreans these words are the very definition of the Soul.  The  Pythagoreans had to believe that the world is a manifestation of Soul.  Furthermore, we  think of the efficiency they attributed to number and especially to the decad.  It is  number that holds everything together and makes things knowable.  In the Timaeus, the  soul <66> is characterized by number, from which we may conclude that the  Pythagoreans did not refer to the world as number and harmony without [p.43] it doing  something.  The Pythagoreans were therefore led to posit the world as living.   We see from this analysis that for Pythagoras the Soul was only a principle of  order and measure.  The Soul is still that, but something more for Plato.  I will not try to  explain the formation of the World Soul, Timaeus, 39 a: text that immediately passes  for a model of obscurity (Cicero, Sextus) and which Proclus, Plutarch, Plotinus  interpreted differently.  It concerns the operation of a mixture of divisible and  indivisible essence.  We shall only define the role and function of the soul according to  Plato’s information.   For him, the World Soul is what the individual soul is to the body, the principle  of movement. Laws, X, 896 a: “The movement capable of moving itself”, Phaedrus ,  249 c: "Only that which moves itself is the source and principle of <67> movement”.   Thus, the soul's first role is to provide an impulsion to things. </p><div id="pagenum"><p>386</p></div><p id="page">24    Secondly, it is the principle of measurement and harmony.  In the Timaeus, the  soul is composed according to the numbers which express harmony, the harmonics, and  astronomical systems.   What then is the soul in itself, what place does it occupy between Ideas and  sensible things? εἶδος or αἰσθητόν?  Neither one, nor the other.  It cannot be a sensible  thing since αἰσθητά [sensibles] are inert; they are all ready-made, not principles of  becoming.  Nor an idea: the idea is first of all eternal and timeless, immutable, not  subject to becoming, and represents the kind [genre].  But the World Soul: 1. becomes,  being the very principle of becoming; 2. is an individual.  The soul is something  intermediate, which is natural given its mathematical character.  It takes its place  among these mathematically ordered existences that Plato puts immediately below the  Ideas (Metaphysics,  987 a14).   <68> Why do we need a plurality of intermediate essences between the Idea and  the sensible?  In Plato’s philosophy, the passage from the sensible to the intelligible is  clear as dialectic, but the reverse passage is an obscure thing that is mythically  expressed.  In the Platonic myths that express all this descending movement by which  one passes from Ideas to things, there must be reference points in this movement: souls,  gods, and especially the World Soul, play this role. [p.44]  These are the objects of  Platonic myths.  It is a vague definition, but the idea is not more distinct in Plato who,  by his conception, could not clarify it.   Plotinus pulled this idea from the shadows because he borrowed it exclusively  from Plato.  The Soul of Plotinus is sometimes compared to the Stoic fire; however, the  analogy is wholly superficial, the differences profound.  According to the Stoics, the  fire is self-sufficient; it is not derived from a superior, extra-temporal essence.  For  Plotinus it is a <69> derivation of νοῦς; one cannot even look closely at it without  seeing it contract and ultimately become absorbed in νοῦς.  Moreover, the soul of the  Stoics becomes matter and matter, soul.  In Plotinus, if matter comes from the Soul, it is  not by transformation; it is a derivation which does not prevent the Soul from  remaining itself.  The source of his conception is solely Plato.   Plotinus brought Plato's theory fully into the light.  He produced a theory of the  body, an implicit theory of space, an explicit theory of time, and even a theory of  consciousness.  This hypothesis, the latter metaphysically, is primarily important for  knowledge.  Plotinus spoke of the others in terms of extension and purification of the  concept of the Soul. </p><div id="pagenum"><p>387</p></div><p id="page">25    Recall the manner in which he gradually came to attribute a Soul to the  universe.  It is by the consideration of analogies between the world and a particular  living being.  A living being manifests a soul, first in the form of generative <70>  reason.  A living body is a multiplicity of parts between which there is κοινωνία [a  communication of properties]; an animal is one whole and sympathetic with itself  (ὁμοπάθεια [common affection or quality], συναίσθησις [conscious perception] =  consensus).  Therefore, there must be a principle of harmony.  Ennead, III.2.2: “In the  logos generator, everything is given together and in the same thing”. Ibid., VI.7.14 :  “Logos is a multiple unity, a scheme, a sketch that contains sketches ... an undivided  centre that contains and summarizes its entire circumference.”  So, a living being is the  manifestation of a logos.   Also, logos is not completely Idea; the Idea is the archetype outside of space  and time.  Logos is what comes out of the Idea, to act as it descends in space and time;  it is the Idea become force.  Precisely because the Idea becomes action, it is exposed to  [p.45] meet with resistance, to imperfection.  If there is a logos in every living body,  there is at the same time something that resists it.  It does not mean that the logos of a  man <71> is lame.  So, there is something it has resisted, which was not in the  generative logos.  But in this fault of production in becoming, the logos has not gained  the upper hand, and what prevails is a deterioration, by chance, of the idea that the  logos brought with it63.  It is that matter is there, bringing to the form its lack of form,  in the measure of its excess and its defect, until, in the process of formation it has  brought the being to be not of itself but of it [matter].  Therefore, matter opposes the  information of the logos.  Moreover, we shall see that matter is only a weakening or  exhaustion of the logos in proportion to its work.   So, let us say that a living being is the soul as logos and, by the same effect of  this work, it becomes weaker; additionally: it extends into space.  Logos expands into  space by the same work.  Porphyry (άφορμαί [theory of rational tendencies], 37) 64 has  clarified this idea well: “Solidity [mass] is a reduction in the power of the immaterial  being, who is solely real.”   In summary, in a living being there is logos, the aspect of which is materiality,  and finally distension in space that always implies a harmony.  As for the Universal  Soul, one wonders, does the universe have the external appearance of a living being  thus defined? </p><div id="pagenum"><p>388</p></div><p id="page">26    There is much sympathy between all parts of the universe.  Astrology  establishes this point.  It would be impossible if we did not assume that which is  present at any one point.  The stars have no influence, but significance (IV.4.6).   Furthermore (IV.4.33), the universe is compared to a dancer, all of whose movements  <73> are so related that the scholar who perceives it as one could reconstruct the whole  movement by interpreting the movements, one by the other.  This is also how astrology  proceeds.   Likewise, magic is the power to act on a specific point of the universe by acting  on another point.   Finally, why are prayers answered?  It is not that the gods are listening. By the  effect of sympathy, there is a way to influence the animated universe.   [p.46]  T he universe is therefore a living being and as such is the manifestation  of a generative reason.  We must now determine this Soul of things.  We will firstly  determine the relation to what is below it, the matter it informs, then the relation to  νοῦς (see also II.12.31) above it, and finally we will try to determine it in itself.   <74>  The first question is this: If we take Soul, that is to say something that  comes out of νοῦς but which by its higher aspect is still something of a one, how can  we explain this Soul as the indefinite multiplicity of things in space and time?  Plato  had to speak about non-being next to the Ideas.  Plotinus wants to bring the same Ideas  out of non-being.  How can something that, by its nature, appears repugnant to Intellect  – the totality of things - be the Soul that, from above, is still within the mind?   Soul is firstly flagged as a force which, as such, has the need and the power to  produce, draws from itself all that it contains and which, by virtue of the principle that  the generated is inferior to what generates, it produces an imperfect body at the bottom  of which is matter that would be the bitter dregs of an inferior being (II.3.17) 65.   <75>  But why would the Soul which is form produce anything formless?   “A great light that shines out of the Soul tends to become dark in proportion as  it moves away from its hearth” (VI.3.9). – “But the darkness, by that very fact that the  Soul sees it, penetrates them and gives them a form.”  So, in letting them escape from  it, the Soul lets them out more diminished to the limit ever reached, where they would  be darkness.  Wanting to grasp pure matter, it would want to grasp the absolute shadow  without light.   In this form, matter would still be purely negative, but it must have something  efficacious, otherwise why would the Soul remain remote66 from its original unity?  (cf. </p><div id="pagenum"><p>389</p></div><p id="page">27   III.6 to the end)67.  Matter is initially presented as a Platonic non-being.  Its role is to  arrest the procession of things coming out of νοῦς <76>, he compares it to the < > 68  which lives continuously.  But mostly, III.6.14, matter is compared to a mirror that  reflects an illusory image; [p.47] and the mirror is an image itself, a mirage that is the  source of mirages.  And “if the images directly emanated beings, they subsist without  needing to be in something else, but as the real beings remain confined within  themselves, there must be something that provides them with a place where they do not  subsist”.  In other words, if images, sensible things, were an immediate effect of the  Idea, the Idea would be sensible immediately; there would be no need of matter.  But it  must be said that every image needs to rely on another image.  V.9.5: This image is by  its very nature in something other than itself.  Only the Idea is in itself.   IV.8.6: The  process must continue up to the limits of the possible. II.3.18: The world <77> is an  image that is formed continually.  That is, if the Soul remains where it is originally,  there would be nothing sensible.  Suppose a cause that acts [makes] going out of νοῦς;  we fully present things because an image cannot occur without placing it in another  image, and so on.  Thus it engenders the indefiniteness of space, time and matter.   Matter is only the indefiniteness of things, the ceaseless creation of images.   Compare this theory to Kant.  Plotinus presents on the one hand the Idea, and,  on the other hand, phenomenal reality, and like Kant, made phenomenal reality consist  of an indefinite progress.  For Kant, this is the experience, and two mathematical  antinomies come from what we mistake for the nature of experience that is progress  and movement, and what we want to grasp as an actual [in the present time] infinity.    -  But the difference is great <78>: for Kant, neither space and time, which determine the  flux of phenomena, nor the causality that links them, can be generated; they are given  as pure forms and a scheme.  In Plotinus we have instead, an effort to deduce space,  time and even temporal causality.  Space and time are deduced from what is in space,  and time is the incomplete manifestation of the Idea, the image.  And then the image  seeks completion; it is in this way that space and time are generated.  Similarly,  causality is the effort of a thing to bring out what it has in it.  For Plotinus, it is the  effort of a thing to find something else on which to sit, and rather than appearing, the  seat slips away. [p.48]  So, causality is also explained by the journey of an incomplete  being in search of himself.  All this is deduced from the extra-temporal and extra- spatial.  <79> </p><div id="pagenum"><p>390</p></div><p id="page">28   6.  The Procession of the Soul and the Principal of Radiation      <80> We have seen how the Universal Soul engenders images that feature in  space and time, because the mere fact of the multiplicity of images is what engenders  time and space.  The indefinite in time and space is simply the translation of the  poverty of the image that seeks to rely on another image.   The Universal Soul is that which is called ὴ ἐν κόσμῳ or ἐν σώματι ψυχή; but  above this Soul, he sometimes puts another that is opposed to it: the Divine Soul, ψυχή  θειοτάτη.   II.3.9: The world is made of a body and a Soul, but above that <81> a Soul that  illuminates this one, the pure Soul, χαθαρά, which if joined to the world, makes that  aberrant world a god; but if it withdraws, a demon remains there (?).  II.3.18: the  Universal Soul turned towards God contemplates the best, and the general Soul is the  image of this superior and contemplative Soul69.   So according to Zeller there would be two universal Souls in Plotinus, the  second would be the image, reducing the first.  What can we make of it?   First, there is never a question of three hypostases: One, Intellect, Soul.  On the  other hand, if one assumes a higher Soul whose function would only be contemplation,  it is not clear how this Soul differs from νοῦς (see also II.16.21, 28).  So, it seems that  there is one, above all <82> contemplation, νοῦς which contemplates it, and finally a  being which is less than contemplation, that is action.  Nevertheless, Plotinus seems to  say that there are two Souls.   Reference should be made to the function of the Universal Soul, but first we  must present the one superior to essence and knowledge.  All the ideas [p.49] that make  up νοῦς are then presented within the eternal as many visions of the One.  All of this is  outside of time; unity and multiplicity are equally timeless.  Below there can only be a  multiplicity in space and time: the images, or things.  The function of the Universal  Soul will be to fetch the Ideas from within Intellect and bring them down into space and  time in the form of generative reasons.  The Soul will be the vehicle of the Ideas in  space and time.   <83>  It takes the Ideas and divides them: III.9.1 : μεριστὴν ἐνέργειαν  ἔχει ἐν μεριστῇ  φύσει [it has a divisible action in divisible in nature]70.   Hence the Universal Soul taken at its source is indistinguishable from νοῦς, the  world of Ideas.  Given this intelligible world, let us recognize that sensible things come  from these Ideas.  How do they come out, if not by the action of this special force that </p><div id="pagenum"><p>391</p></div><p id="page">29   leaves little by little?  Firstly the Soul coincides with Intellect, but a logical moment  comes when the Soul emerges to materialise.  And consequently, we can say that at a  certain moment it is within Intellect, and is the radiance: V.1.3.  There are not two  World Souls but one, taken when it is about to go out of Intellect, and at the moment of  its exit.  <84>  When Plotinus opposes the divine Soul to the lower Soul, he said that if  the first is pure, it is because it is taken at its exit from νοῦς.  And, II.3.18, the higher  Soul is described as celestial and the lower Soul is said to ensue from above.  Finally,  there are texts saying that these two Souls are aspects of the same Universal Soul.   V.1.10: A part of the Soul proceeds in the sensible world, while a part remains in the  intelligible world.  V.2.5: The Soul must be one without being absolutely, otherwise it  would not produce a plurality if remote from the unity.  IV.2.2: The Soul is both one  and many, divided and undivided. IV.1.1: IV.3,19: VI.7.9.   But we should clarify this idea.  Plotinus speaks of a single Soul: but both  powers of the Soul are not so different, to the point of being logically exclusive.  The  Soul is infinitely divisible <85> and absolutely one - infinitely mobile and dispersed in  space and time, and absolutely changeless outside space and space and time.  These  contradictory attributes may be juxtaposed: while it is nevertheless a matter of two  Souls.  How did Plotinus reconcile two sets of attributes which logically, seem to be  exclusive in the Universal Soul [p.50]?  It is all a question of the Universal Soul, and  consequently the individual soul.  It is to know whether Plotinus triumphed over  Platonic dualism.  The problem posed by Plato, according to Plotinus, is that of the  passage from the intelligible to the sensible and from the idea to things; and the  Universal Soul has exactly the function of taking Ideas, multiplying them and diluting  them in things.  It is therefore intended to solve the Platonic problem, to give us a  metaphysical translation of the myths of Plato, who only expressed <86> mythically the  process of descent with stories taking place in time.   If Plotinus is merely taking these two contradictory attributes, timeless unity  and multiplicity in time, and juxtaposing them in a Soul he calls one but that is in fact  two, the problem is not resolved.   The problem is more important still.  The process by which the Ideas descend is  the same kind as the operation by which the One refracts itself into Ideas. V.2.1: The  operation is the same, the principle is the same. </p><div id="pagenum"><p>392</p></div><p id="page">30    What is this principle?  In the case before us, the derivation of the Soul, this  principle should make us understand how sensible things proceed from Ideas.  It is  therefore a matter of a type of causation.   But causality can take two forms71 depending on whether <87> it is generation  in time or a causality that is logical and timeless; when a being generates another being,  or when the consequences come out of their principle.  The first process involves  succession; the second does not imply time.  However, the causality in question in  Plotinus is neither one nor the other: but the cause is outside of time and the effect  within time.  The lower and general Soul is time itself; the higher Soul which coincides  with νοῦς defines itself by its eternity.  But we could generalise this definition.  It must  be said that the cause is one and indivisible, the effect is the multiplicity to which it  gives birth.   This is due to the fact that the causation of substance, of hypostasis to <88>  hypostasis is unilateral.  For us the relation of cause and effect is like any relationship, a  relationship between two terms such that if B is related to A, A is related to B.  In  Plotinus, the effect is in [p.51] relation with the cause, and not vice versa.  The One  generates the multiplicity of Ideas, but without occupying it, and Ideas do not exist for  it.  Similarly, the engendered Soul turns towards Intellect.  But the Soul does not exist  for Intellect. Intellect is absolutely locked up in itself.  If we place ourselves within the  effect, the cause exists.  If we place ourselves in the cause, for it at least, the effect does  not.   The cause is sometimes a source that remains itself while feeding rivers,  sometimes the life of a plant which remains in the roots but feeds the branches,  sometimes it is a hearth <89> which radiates (ἔκλαμψις [shining forth], ἐπίλαμψις  [epilampsis, illumination], περίλαμψις [radiation]).  But Plotinus does not need images.   VI.8.8: “The first principle is the cause, though in another sense it is not the cause.   Because to speak of cause here would be to speak of an action on something else; yet,  nothing is related to the cause.”  VI.9.3: “When we speak of the principle of causality,  we are not talking about something that is added to it, but to us, since we derive  something from it; it however remains itself.”  VI.8.18: It happens to be without having  been brought into being.  Plotinus therefore defines causation between the hypostases  metaphysically.   Before examining this principle of illumination, let us say that it has an origin  that is easily determined.  Vacherot and some others have argued that this <90> </p><div id="pagenum"><p>393</p></div><p id="page">31   principle could only come from some oriental influence; and the only proof of the  oriental influence on Plotinus is quoted by Vacherot.  Is it true that this idea is not  Greek?   But Plotinus sought to examine Plato, and to know the process of the Idea.   But in Plato, the intelligible is the immutable; it is the sensible that changes.  The Idea  alone has an absolute reality.  Sensible reality cannot hold the Idea, therefore the Idea  produces it; but the Idea cannot go out of itself without ceasing to be the Idea.   Therefore, it will be a cause seen from the side of the effect, but that view of itself will  no longer be a cause.   So, the principle of radiation is by no means the solution of a problem, it is the  statement.  It is the mere finding of the need for <91> multiple things to go out of Ideas  without the Ideas coming out of themselves.  It is unnecessary to appeal to the Orient.   It is the same problem stated in its precise form.  There is not even an original effort  from Plotinus and if he remained there he would not have done much.   [p.52] This is what Zeller reproaches him for.  According to him, images only  mask a contradiction; the assertion of a cause that does not belong to causation, that has  no relation to its effect, and is perfectly sufficient to itself.  It is this contradiction that  shows through the images covering it.  What should we make of it?   I assume that in the mind of Plotinus there is a certain experience that he was  able to take from life, the grasping of one side, sensible, the other intelligible, and the  transition from one to the other, which together showed him the “soul awakened” and  the “soul that dreams”, and which proved to him that awakening exists for the dream,  but not the dream for the awakening.  How would Plotinus make us understand it other  than by images, which furthermore, are intended to suggest a state of mind similar to  that experienced by the philosopher?  The concepts that Zeller opposes in Plotinus are  images, although familiar ones, it is true: there must be a cause either within or outside  it, so that the relation of cause to effect is reciprocal.  These are real things in space and  time.  Any development beyond the concept cannot be made with images.  Plotinus was  able to make an effort <93> to extend the limits of intelligence72.   That is right.  At the start of IV.8 Plotinus invokes the experience well in a  considerable text73: “Often I wake up from my body, outside all other things, inside  myself, living the higher life, coinciding with the divine; then when I descend from  contemplative reason to discursive reasoning I wonder how it is that this descent is  done”. 74 </p><div id="pagenum"><p>394</p></div><p id="page">32    So, there is an ascertainable passage within the experience of the descent,  during which the question does not arise; but it rests when we are at the bottom.  At the  end of III.8.10: Plotinus advises us on the intuition for grasping the principle.  Finally,  the idea that God is the cause in relation to us, not in relation to him, is proved by the  experience, VI.975.   <94>  This does not prove that Plotinus had wanted to make the passage  intelligible.  Has he at least made an effort to explain why we cannot understand?    Zeller treats the theory of categories, VI.1.3 contemptuously; however, it is a very  important part76.  Porphyry placed these three books in the final Ennead.  The main  idea is that Aristotle was wrong to believe that the sensible categories are the same as  those [p.53] of the intelligible, considering that the general determinations of sensible  being cannot be the same as the general determinations of intelligible being.  Here there  is an indication of something which announces critical philosophy.  Furthermore, there  is not a huge difference between mysticism and critical philosophy, <95> mysticism  reserving the absolute for supra-empirical knowledge.   We cannot therefore apply categories to being per se.  In the first book, he  studied ποιεῖν [poiesis] and πάσχειν [receiving an external impression, suffering], and  established that this category only belongs to the sensible and cannot be related to the  intelligible.  On the other hand, one type of experience shows us the sensible being  derived from the intelligible77.  So, if we place ourselves in the sensible, we have the  right to apply the category of causality, and if we place ourselves in the intelligible, we  lose that right.   By this alone, Plotinus saw how his doctrine of higher intuition required a kind  of logical complement, that without making an Idea intelligible, which it is not, at least  allows us <96> to understand why we do not understand.  That's all we can ask of a  philosopher of a mystical background.  But we must note in Plotinus this effort to move  closer to the mysticism of rationalism to a certain extent.     7. The Universal Soul Considered in Itself     <97>  We determined in turn the Universal Soul in relation to what follows and  what precedes it.  It creates nature by creating space and time, because the image once  produced demands to be completed.  On the other hand, its apex is within νοῦς, but in </p><div id="pagenum"><p>395</p></div><p id="page">33   addition, or rather less, it has a tendency to come out of it: it comes out thanks to a  certain form of single sided causality.  We must now determine the Universal Soul in  relation to itself, considered in itself.  How does Plotinus depict it?  Is it a conscious  Soul?   [p.54]  If Plotinus has represented the World Soul as a higher consciousness,  which would create the material world like we create <98> our dreams, then this  conception is still semi-mythical.  Plotinus has not gone past the point of view of Plato.  We are seeking a metaphysical explanation of the procession in him, but we would still  be within mythology.   If, on the other hand, Plotinus, instead of representing it as an intensified human  soul, constructed for himself the concept of Universal Soul, and in descending by way  of impoverishment, arrived at the idea of consciousness, we find in him: firstly a new  theory of consciousness, since it will not be something simple, but a product, or  something which can be reached by deduction or synthesis;  then the Universal Soul  can no longer be defined as consciousness, and he must reach inside the Universal Soul.   Which of these two solutions did he adopt?   If the texts are examined superficially, the impression given is that the  Universal Soul <99> is a conscious Soul, and many people have been deceived,  believing that the Universal Soul would have consciousness like ours.  Kirchner even  maintains that it has reasoning essentially, τὸ λογίζεσθαι.  Zeller, without going so far,  uses a text in which Plotinus speaks of συναίσθησις [conscious perception], that he  translates as consciousness, but recognizes that there are texts and particular theories  that oppose it; he concludes that Plotinus contradicts himself and oscillates.   The truth is that Plotinus is the only ancient philosopher that has sought to  elucidate the concept of consciousness, to study the fact of consciousness  independently of thought, and he had to create a terminology; with a certain  awkwardness and some hesitations.  But his thinking is clear.  If we give to the word  ‘consciousness’ a sense of something that tends towards the personal78 form, i.e., its  ordinary meaning, it is beyond doubt that the Universal Soul is unconscious.   <100>  We will see later what consciousness is for Plotinus in detail.  Let us  indicate only the functions of άντίληψις [sense perception].  There is    1.  the restlessness of the body,  2.  pleasure and pain,  [p.55] 3.  the perception of the external body </p><div id="pagenum"><p>396</p></div><p id="page">34   4.  memory  5.  διάνοια, discursive reason.     However, none of these functions can belong to the Universal Soul.  1. The restlessness of the body.  We, who are souls joined to partial bodies,  are exposed to dangers.  The human body is subject to the influence of other bodies and  is exposed to decomposition.  Restlessness is the law of the life.  But the body of the  Universal Soul is all of matter; nothing can threaten it.  It flows on, but inside itself, and  as it is contained in the World Soul, it is eternal.   2. Pain occurs when the body is under threat of losing the image of the  soul, that is when a separation between body and soul becomes <101> possible.  In  other words, this is the beginning of death.  Pleasure occurs when (VI.4.19) the  equilibrium is restored, when the soul readjusts is to the body.  "Pain is consciousness  of a separation from the body, which is deprived of the image of the soul.”79  But the  body of the world is inextricably bound to the Soul, being its necessary unfoldment in  the form of space and time.  3. External perception is purely an internal phenomenon of the soul: It  demands the meeting of two opposing elements. By right, we all have the perception of  all things in the form of νόησις [intellection] that is in a latent form.  In order for what  is virtual to become actual, an impression has to occur in the body; then the thought  goes to the fore, and φαντασία [imagination], occurs at the meeting.  This however, is  nothing but a phenomenon of sympathy <102> with an external phenomenon.   Perception presupposes firstly multiple external bodies, and secondly, an organ  of perception in the perceiving body.  However, there is no outer body to the body of  the world, and (II.8.2) the World Soul has no organ.  4. Memory.  Plotinus disentangles the relationship of consciousness and  memory and saw that there is no consciousness where there is no prolongation [p.56] of  the past in the present, i.e. memory.  But memory belongs to a being that is making  progress, which is fallen and seeks itself (IV.4)80.  In the same Ennead, IV.4.681, he  explains the conditions of memory: its condition is time.  But the World Soul does not  occupy time; time is in it, goes out of it, but [the Soul] is not in it, dominating it,  expressing it, but eminently in the form of eternity.  5. Reasoning remains.  Kirchner argues that the Universal Soul reasons and  </p><div id="pagenum"><p>397</p></div><p id="page">35   <103> has λογισμός [reasoning] as its essential function.  He quotes V.3.3: ψυχήν ἐν  λογισμοῖς εἶναι, but the context is sufficient proof that it is not a question of the  Universal Soul, but of the human soul. This is a clerical error.   We see from this examination that the World Soul does not perform any  specific function of consciousness.  Should we conclude that it is unconscious?  The  text seems to indicate otherwise, IV.4.24: συναίσθησιν μὲν αὑτῦ ὥσπερ ἡμεῖς ἡμῶν  συναισθανόμεθα82.  But συναίσθησις does not mean consciousness.  Let us analyze the  word that will tell us about the nature of the Universal Soul.   Quoting a few texts.  IV.5.5 ὥσπερ ἐλέγετο…  (These concern hearing, that is  external perception): “One can say about the affection of hearing what we said of  vision; that is a certain συναίσθησις [conscious perception] as in an animal.” <104>  The word here means the sympathy of an organ with the body which it perceives, as in  an animal where all the parts correspond.  And, indeed, the soul is a living thing.   IV.4.45: “Within any animal each of the parts contributes to the whole and there is a  συναίσθησις where all are completely in rapport with the whole.”  The meaning of the  word here is consensus, reciprocal agreement.  This is the fundamental meaning of the  word.   Returning to our text: “The Universal Soul must be attributed to have  συναίσθησις [conscious perception] of itself, just as we have συναίσθησις [conscious  perception] of ourselves; but it should not be attributed to the sensation, αἴσθησις  [sense perception] such as this is always the sensation of a foreign object.”  We cannot  attribute sensation to the Universal Soul, friends we must give it συναίσθησις  [conscious perception].  Our συναίσθησις [conscious perception] of ourselves is an  agreement of αἴσθησις [sense perception] and is consequently one consciousness.  But  συναίσθησις [conscious perception] of the whole may not be <105> consciousness,  since there is no αἴσθησις [sense perception].  Συναίσθησις [conscious perception] may  therefore mean accidental consciousness, in the [p.57] case where unified elements are  elements of consciousness.  We translate this word as "internal synthetic unity."   If it is not consciousness, what is it? V.3.13: “The synthetic unity of everything  seems to me to be, when a multiplicity converges towards unity, the thought, τὸ νοεῖν.”   Plotinus repeats incessantly: the lower function of the Universal Soul is to produce; its  superior function is to contemplate.  Its divine part is within Intellect.   But what is this thought?  Is this consciousness?  We shall see that Plotinus’  νόησις [intellection] is a superior function of the human soul, but which does not </p><div id="pagenum"><p>398</p></div><p id="page">36   strictly belong to it.  The truly human function is λογίζεσθαι [reasoning].  With <106>  intellection we go out of ourselves.  The understanding then is not conscious, and if we  keep the word’s meaning it manages to create an imagination, φαντασία, in which it is  reflected, as in a mirror.  In other words, there is consciousness where there is a  diminution of νοῦς, a progress which shows a decline, where there is action and  weakness of contemplation.  Consciousness occurs after a fall: as it falls into the body,  it substitutes for the eternity of thought, the continuity of progress over time, that is,  consciousness.   The συναίσθησις of the Universal Soul is then the unity of all, the convergence  of all the parts which is characteristic of the pure Idea <107>.  Each human soul  contains the reason of his body and this reason is included in the universal reason.  All  individual souls are contained within the Universal Soul and each is conscious, but if  we take them all synthetically within the Universal Soul, there is no longer  consciousness.  This unconsciousness is, if you like, something at which we arrive,  starting from consciousness, but by way of enrichment, and assuming that within the  eternal, our consciousness develops in time.  Being given the Soul in the νοῦς, there is  nothing to add to it for it to become aware, but something to lose.   It takes a great effort to represent this form of being, but it is not impossible to  arrive at it.  It will take the realisation that thought is explained by the Intellect.  It was  said that the Platonic Ideas [p.58] were thoughts <108> of God, but by basing it on  Plotinus.  It is quite the opposite; according to Plotinus, the act of thinking can get  clearer only if we go back to the intelligible, to νοῦς.  How?  I am conscious of the  image of a triangle.  It is conscious because I represent it for a certain time and within a  certain space.  To advance to the idea of a triangle, I will disregard particular images;  but as long as I represent it in time, I place under it the idea of a general image.  If I  want to represent the pure idea to myself, I go out of consciousness, I coincide with the  intelligible, and I am no longer me83.   Yet, there is a conscious Socrates.  It is only the unfolding of the eternal idea of  Socrates into space and time, and consequently if we want to pass from Socrates to his  Idea, it will be necessary to assume a pure coincidence with the intelligible, where all  consciousness <109> will be abolished; to move to the idea of Socrates, or of the  triangle, it is necessary to infinitely intensify the image of the triangle or Socrates.  And  conversely, to descend from the Idea to the image, from thought to consciousness, there  is nothing to add, there is only impoverishment.  Aristotle said that we cannot think </p><div id="pagenum"><p>399</p></div><p id="page">37   without an image; but it is more than conscious thought.  This is the super-conscious  thinking that Plotinus attributed to the Universal Soul.   This conception of consciousness is absolutely opposed to the modern  conception.  For us consciousness is something simple.  The state of consciousness is  the type of individuality.  Plato had already made the soul a μῖξις [mixture].  For  Plotinus, it is a mixture, something that occurs between thought, or upper limit, and  materiality, lower limit.  A triangle is between the idea of the triangle and the  indefiniteness of space and time. <110> Similarly, a soul can be resolved into pure  materiality and the idea of this soul.  Finally, there is the movement of this lower limit  to the upper limit, and this movement is consciousness.   So, we can understand why Plotinus called Soul the hypostasis that unfolds the  Ideas in space and time.  If consciousness was bare essence, it might seem surprising  that he had given the name of Soul to a being that is not conscious: and this is why the  term Universal Soul surprises us.  But consciousness is an accompaniment; the Soul  could bypass it if need be.  The essence of the Soul is its function as a vehicle for the  generative reasons.  [p.59]  <111>  Having solved this problem, Plotinus resolves the necessary relations for  the fundamental problem of the origin of the individual soul.  Firstly, the problem of life.  What part does nature and the moral person play in  the formation of our physical person?  The living body is a collaboration between nature and the soul.  It is nature that  produces the body; the Universal Soul at least, in the form of nature, and on the other  hand the individual soul makes [is] its body.  The living body is the meeting point of  these two operations.  What is the respective role of these two causes?  Essential texts: VI.4.15.  The human body exists before the soul has come <112>  to take possession of it, but it had the ability to receive it, it was in his vicinity, he  received a warmth and illumination.  He was prepared for it because it was a body that  was not without participation in the soul; because nature has already sketched the body.   VI.7.7:  “What prevents the Universal Soul from preparing a sketch, because it is the  universal logos before the individual souls are inserted?  This sketch would be like a  preliminary illumination of matter, and then the individual soul going back over these  lines, organizes them part by part.  And so each soul becomes the body to which it has  been added, having thus accomplished his figure, like one who being part of a dance  chorus <113> is in keeping with the role assigned to it.” </p><div id="pagenum"><p>400</p></div><p id="page">38   Interpretation.   Let us represent it as a person who sees figures when looking at clouds, or a rug  in the form of geometric lines running in all directions.  In a sense it is not without  participation of the soul, because it took a geometer to draw these lines.  If I look at it, I  can unravel a determined figure there, a hexagon, and then I will see nothing else.  In a  sense it is I who trace, and in another sense it is the manufacturer of the fabric.  The  design is there; but it is by projecting something from me that I have produced this  design there, and even I could project the whole design by imagination; but I found the  design ready-made, and I chose what was more agreeable to my imagination.  In a  sense <114> this is analogous to the body being produced by both nature and the  individual soul.  [p.60]  In the first sense it is simply part of the whole, in the second  sense the soul adds nothing by fitting in to it, but is detached from everything.  As  Plotinus says, there is superposition of the sensible man on intelligible man.  Let us try to go beyond these comparisons and go back to theoretical principles.   The principle was clarified by Porphyry, Elevations  84, §14: “There are two kinds of  generation; one causal and the other is by composition.  Simple substances are  generated by way of causation, as ψυχή [soul] is by νοῦς, but there is also genesis by  composition.  However, living bodies are generated in two ways at the same time, by a  cause, and by composition”.  The method of composition is the path of the physical; we  would say that a body <115> is shaped physically by composition.  The other mode is  one in which a higher cause descends into matter, which is the procession.  Today we distinguish between two theories that explain life85.  Firstly, the  mechanistic explanation in which it is assumed that the phenomena of life are the result  of physico-chemical forces that cause the combination of molecules.  Plotinus refuted  the principle of this theory, arguing that organization cannot come from inertia.   Secondly the theory that a principle of a psychological order would descend towards  the material, would manage to pull the molecules within its orbit, to magnetise them in  its direction.  Plotinus’ solution is not to accept any of these two extreme explanations86.   Matter alone cannot constitute the living.  The individual soul cannot produce life  because it is <16> in the presence of the work of the Universal Soul, and it cannot  organise constituted matter.  There will be cooperation of the two forces.  The soul  must submit to the laws of nature:  it can only lean towards matter in seeking to give </p><div id="pagenum"><p>401</p></div><p id="page">39   itself a body; but at the same time the body aspires to life because it is the work of the  Universal Soul.  It is the meeting point that constitutes life.   It is a very profound solution.  If the problem is theoretically conceivable, we  find that the physico-chemical forces can generate something that already imitates life  fairly closely; bodies that are organized chemically happen to rub shoulders with the  living.  It lacks a beginning, and it would seem that there must be something coming  from above.  But this something [p.61] would make nothing if matter was not already  by <117> itself ready to be organised.  All is happening as if life could only be added if  these forces were already quite prepared and advancing there.   More generally, the conceivable causality between the different degrees of  nature seems to be something like this.  We neither conceive how lower forces would  manage to create new properties by themselves, nor how superior forces would come to  impose refractory matter.  Everything happens as if the superior forces were there,  waiting for the moment when the lower forces will sketch the form to be received.  So,  the higher forces, attracted by their image descend into the lower forces to continue the  movement87.   <118>  The first consequence to be drawn concerns the problem of freedom.   We have just looked at how life can be reconciled with natural forces.  We need to find  how the freedom he attributes to the soul is reconciled with the necessity of nature.   The solution is in the theory of the formation of the body.   IV.3.13.  The question is posed in narrow form: to what extent is the choice of a  body free?  It is neither necessary nor voluntary.  “Souls neither descend of their own  free will nor are they sent.  It is not necessity, because the descent is made by virtue of  an internal inclination which brings the soul to the descent, as one is brought to  marriage.  It is indeed necessity, but it seems as though νοῦς obeys necessity when it  stays where it is.”88  In other words, if being free consists in remaining entirely what we  are, the descent is not pure freedom.  But if necessity consists in undergoing an external  influence, then the descent is not necessary because it is consistent with a natural  inclination of the soul.   Plotinus generalises the problem.  To what extent, once the body is chosen, are  we independent of nature in which we are inserted?  III.1.7: “There is a doctrine - that  of the Stoics89 - according to whom there is only one principle, which would bind all  things to each other and determine each of them by generative reasons.  Close to this is  the doctrine which says that any state and any movement, of either us or the whole is </p><div id="pagenum"><p>402</p></div><p id="page">40   derived from the Universal Soul - Heraclitus.  [p.62]  In this doctrine, all our  representations and all our tendencies occur <120> by necessary causes, so that our  freedom is only a word.”   Thus, the formula for necessity is: a single cause develops  all of these effects.  “It is a question of finding the solution which, firstly, leaves no  phenomenon without a cause and maintains the continuation and order of things, and  which secondly, allows us to be something.”90  Thus the problem is: preserve causality  without sacrificing our freedom.  <121>    8. The Fall of Souls    <122> We turn to the individual soul. What is it? What relationship does it have with  the World Soul, with Intellect, with the One?  What relationship do we maintain with  nature, intelligence and God?  The question that immediately arises is the relationship  of the human soul to the Soul of all.  It is to know whether the most natural solution is  real: that of Vacherot and Kirchner91.  According to them, the human soul derives  purely and simply from the World Soul as the effect of the cause and a part of the  whole.   We know that the One generates Intellect, and Intellect the World Soul.  It  seems natural to say that the World Soul <  > individual souls92, and this solution is  similar to the Stoic solution. <123> Finally Plotinus spoke of three hypostases: The  One, Intellect, and Universal Soul.  It seems natural, since there is nothing to make the  individual souls come out, as there is for the nature of the Universal Soul.   If it is claimed that the human soul was created by the World Soul you will  certainly need to say what the nature of this derivation is.  Is it a derivation in time, as a  temporal cause generates its effect?  No, because our soul predates its birth, predates its  body since it survives it; it is eternal like the World Soul.  Therefore there is no  derivation in time.  [p.63] There remains the hypothesis of the derivation outside of time that comes  out of the Soul just like the theorems of a definition.  This solution is also unacceptable,  because for Plotinus there is a criterion of this kind of metaphysical derivation:  the  thing derived is lower and consequently possesses other functions.  However, Plotinus  nowhere says that it has inferiority of this kind; the <124> functions of the human soul </p><div id="pagenum"><p>403</p></div><p id="page">41   are the same as those of the Universal Soul.  He even said that each individual soul  would have been able to create the world and did not do so because it was beaten to it  by the Universal Soul.  If the system seems to demand a pantheistic derivation, Plotinus  expresses himself in terms which exclude this derivation.   Richter states the insoluble difficulty.  According to Zeller there are at least two  hypotheses between which it floats: identify the Universal Soul and the human soul;  distinguish between human souls and the Universal Soul; but the contradiction is very  rough.  The relation of souls to the Soul of the whole is not at all simple.  There is  certainly no independence, but also no derivation.  When red light comes out of white  light through a prism, one cannot say that it has white light as its cause; it is not a  causal relationship.  Before presenting the solution, <125> it is necessary to solve another question as  to how and why individual souls become detached from the Universal Soul, because at  first they are in it or with it. Do they abandon it?  First there were mythical answers.  The Universal Soul derives from νοῦς, and  hence is lower.  The result is that in nature, which is the manifestation of the Soul in  space and time, there is not the same harmony as within Intellect: the unity of the world  is not perfect.  III.2.16: “The Universal Soul is a logos that opposes some of its parts,  and thus in nature it generates struggle and war.  It is similar to the plan of a drama that  contains a thousand battles within its unity.”  So, if the infinitely many bodies that the  World Soul sketches and animates carry within themselves traces of discord, it is  natural that the individual souls which will be fitted in to it follows the gradient of  inclination <126> that bodies draw.  III.2.17: “Every part of the whole pulls all it can to  it”; and this would be egoism which would therefore dominate the world of embodied  souls, because that which dominates [p.64] each part is the desire to live.  Egoism is the  law of life, because in space and time each party aims at being the whole; the harmony  disappears.   In fact, it is on moral grounds that Plotinus first explains the fall of souls into  bodies.  At the beginning of V93, he wonders "why and how were they able to forget  God their father, they being divine, and ignoring him in themselves?  The principle of  all evil is audacity, that is desire, the desire to belong only to oneself”.  The desire for  self-existence is the origin of separation. </p><div id="pagenum"><p>404</p></div><p id="page">42    Of what does this audacity consist?  And where does it come from in souls?   They exaggerated to themselves their importance because of an effect of a mirage.   <127> IV.3.12: “The souls of men, having contemplated their image in the  mirror of Bacchus, have yearned to be down here”.  This mirror is matter in general,  refraction of the Universal Soul, matter that offers every human soul a body like his.   Attracted by the promise of independence, the soul rushes, and then it is a prisoner,  chained; and this is the punishment for wanting to live.   Plotinus claims that this doctrine is from all of time.  In IV.8.1, he attributes it to  Empedocles, “for whom it is a law for sinful souls to fall down here, and with the  knowledge that having fled from God, they came here to become the slave of furious  discord”.  Similarly, Plato said that the soul is chained and entombed within the body.   Plotinus adds that this is not just theory, but a fact of experience.  We know the passage  IV.894 where he speaks of the passage of the soul to Intellect <128> and then to the  One.  Coming out of this state, the soul feels itself descend, καταβαίνειν.  The fall is  therefore a fact that can be experienced.   Therefore, in a sense the soul falls into the body by free choice and as a mistake.  What is it the result of its fall?  It is twofold.   Firstly, when it lived in the Universal Soul, it participated in the administration  of the whole world, and as the world is eternal, the individual soul is free of concern as  it rests within the Universal Soul; but when it falls into a body placed between other  bodies and is destroyed by them, worry about the body and concern for life  commences.  [p.65] Secondly, the human soul possesses all the Ideas in the Universal Soul,  which is bound by its higher part with the whole of Intellect.  But as soon as it takes a  body, it possesses more than a part.  It possesses by right <129> all of the ideas, in  which it can always be reinstated with effort; but in fact, it concentrates on a part of  Intellect refracted in space and time.  VI.4.16: "Of the whole of Intellect, it jumped to a  part.  It's as if the scholar who possesses the complete science did not envisage more  than one proposition in it."  Moreover, for Plotinus, every proposition reflects the  whole science.  “The soul thus becomes a particular being, because it focuses its  activity on the body.”  The same idea energetically expressed in Porphyry’s άφορμαί  [rational tendencies], §39: “The soul inclining towards matter is reduced to deprivation  and the exhaustion of its own strength.  Instead when it goes back up to νοῦς it finds the  fullness of its strength.  These are the states of poverty and abundance”. </p><div id="pagenum"><p>405</p></div><p id="page">43    Thus, it is by an effect of their audacity that individual souls have jumped out of  the breast of the Universal Soul <130> into the body.  Hence, they experienced a  diminution of themselves, because they focus on the body and no longer possess that  part of the intelligible world which by right would belong to them whole.   This is the moral point of view.  But already, in IV.3, we see a new explanation  appearing - §695: “Perhaps it is the multiple element of souls that pulls down, pulling  with it the souls themselves, they and their representations”.  In IV.796, he explains that  the individual soul made his body.  So, there would be a physical point of view: the fall  would not be the effect of a choice and punishment for audacity, it would be a natural,  necessary, automatic process.  The soul would no longer fall into a body that it must  suffer:  it would be productive.  Audacity, fall, and punishment would be the moral  aspect of a process that would be natural; the soul being something that partakes of the  Idea, but <131> carries within itself a multiplicity which, as a weight that is too heavy,  pulls it into space and time; so that it becomes the creator of a body by this dividing  activity.   It is necessary to briefly review the Universal Soul and its relation to the whole  of nature.  It is the generative reason of the world.  It develops in space and time,  creating nature which is found to be [p.66] a large organism whose parts are all  sympathetic.  On the other hand, each of the component parts of nature is itself an  organism, provided we know how to distinguish the parts properly; and there must be  generative reasons for all the component parts.  There are therefore one logos, a  universal fabricator of the world, and particular logoi which are the creators of parts of  the universe.   These logoi are ideas, deprived in some way, taken out of eternity, or <132>  rather, extended in space and time.  Therefore, the root of the logoi is in Intellect.   What are the Ideas which correspond respectively to souls fabricating bodies  and to the Universal Soul?  For individual souls, each corresponds to a certain Idea that  represents it eternally in the intelligible world.  Plotinus is less precise about the  Universal Soul, but it is clear.  He says that the Universal Soul is generated by νοῦς,  which is the totality of the intelligibles.  While the Universal Soul is represented in the  intelligible by all the Ideas, it is an extension of the intelligible considered in its  entirety.   Now, for Plotinus, each of the Ideas is in a certain way representative of the  entire νοῦς, it contains all others and carries within it the totality of the others in virtual </p><div id="pagenum"><p>406</p></div><p id="page">44   form:  as in geometry, a proposition fully encompasses the science in its entirety.   <133>   Let us draw the conclusions.  Take a human soul that is represented by a certain  Idea in the intelligible world.  This soul prolonging an Idea that is representative, as an  idea, of any intelligible whole, could, if need be make everything made by the  Universal Soul, an extension of the whole of the intelligible.  The soul of Socrates,  extending the idea of Socrates which is in a sense νοῦς, could create the world.  IV.3.6:  “Why did the Universal Soul, which has the same nature as individual souls, produce  the world, and not each of the particular souls, while each also contains everything in  it?”  The idea has nothing of the paradoxical: if it were my soul, my soul would be the  whole world; if I do not create is because I find myself in the presence of a universal  dream that displaces my dream; to the question posed, Plotinus responds that this is due  to the fact that it has been beaten to it <134> by the Universal Soul.  It is not a question  of time, but the individual souls are pre-empted in law by the Universal Soul [p.67]  which is their superior by degree.  And if one soul can create the world it will be this  one.  Every soul expresses everything from a particular point of view, whereas the  Universal Soul is placed at all points of view at the same time.   Each human soul tends to make the world, but more particularly tends to create  the particular body that expresses his point of view.  Then the Universal Soul which  also manufactures the body of Socrates, but at the same time the idea of Socrates tends  to constitute his body.  This body can therefore be considered as mechanically  produced by nature, and as created by the idea of Socrates.  The fall of the soul is  nothing other than the process by which the soul, according to its natural tendency,  suddenly finds itself encountering a body already fat with <135> the universal logos.   There is a natural insertion and in a certain sense, a fall.   I suppose a white beam falling on a prism and refracted into a thousand multi- coloured rays.  I chose the red ray.  White light is the Universal Soul, the multi- coloured rays, bodies; the red ray the body of Socrates.  In a sense it is the work of the  white light that produces the full spectrum; but in another sense, it is merely an  extension of a red ray that already existed in the white light.  In a sense it extends the  white light, in another sense the red light.  In the same sense, each living body is both  the work of the Universal Soul which creates all bodies, but as inserted into the whole  of the matter, and of the particular soul which comes to go into one of these bodies to  shine on everything else, and in this way to create it. </p><div id="pagenum"><p>407</p></div><p id="page">45    <136>  We now understand in what sense bodies are the natural works of  human souls manifesting their power, and in what sense this insertion is a fall, since by  taking refuge in it the soul’s powers are decreased.  The insertion is at the same time a  natural process and a kind of fall.   <137>  We have started studying the operation by which the soul takes a body,  and we found that Plotinus put forward two alternative points of view, the moral point  of view of the fall where the taking of a body is the cause of audacity for immediate,  selfish means, resulting in a decline, and the physical point of view, where the fall into  the sensible world no longer appears as a morally qualified act, but as [p.68] a physical  fact, natural and, in a sense, necessary, which comes under the general law of  procession through which everything radiates unity.   Is there a transition from one point of view to another in the mind of Plotinus?   Does he have a passage between the fall into the sensible world considered a moral act  and the fall into the sensible world considered physically?   It certainly exists in Plotinus’ mind.  <138>  In IV.3.12-13, the descent is firstly  presented as a kind magical operation: “The soul is drawn into the body like the forces  and powerful attraction of magic.  It is a kind of fascination; therefore, this again is the  moral perspective; but furthermore, there is a necessity that makes every soul descend  at its time, as if it was called by a messenger.”  And then: “The soul automatically  descends into his body.”   There is the same difference as regards the choice of a body.   “The soul goes to the body, which is the image of its preference and of its  original disposition” – “to the body which was prepared by the resemblance of its  disposition” – “to the suitable and similar body”.  It is the moral perspective.   But another expression: "The soul is going to insert into the body that is  necessary for it".97   In Section 8 of Ennead 4, Plotinus constantly speaks <139> of the body as if it  was manufactured by the soul:  it is the logos added to matter that makes the body.   Thus, there is an insensible transition in his thinking from one point of view to the  other.   But does it follow that there is logical kinship between the two ideas?  Is it  possible to reconcile the idea that the soul has chosen a body by sinning and the idea  that an internal necessity makes it enter into space and time?  We do not explicitly find </p><div id="pagenum"><p>408</p></div><p id="page">46   it in the Enneads, but it is easy to do if we refer to the meaning of these different terms  in Plotinus: idea, soul, time and space.   In the intelligible world, all ideas are given one inside the other.  Each idea is  representative of all the others.  In the intelligible world, everything is whole;  everything is the same and everything is different.  Thus, all the ideas of individual  souls are <140> data in each other.  [p.69] This is because we are outside of space and time.  It is different in time  and space.  In the intelligible world, harmony stems precisely from the fact that each  part is the whole; but as a place of space can only contain one object, and a moment of  time a single event, each soul, by taking a body, will exclude all the other souls from a  certain place and a certain time, and as it carries within it a vague representation of the  entire world, it aspires to take up all the room.  It cannot do it, being limited by other  souls, especially the World Soul that anticipates it.  The individual soul is therefore  restrained.  However, this restraint is precisely the very definition of sin, which,  considered physically is the natural descent of the soul into space and time; <141> that  is called sin or fall by very definition even when interpreted morally.   I.8.14: “Entering matter, establishes the fall of the soul.  It weakens, since all its  powers can no longer take action, and what prevents it is matter which forces it to curl  in on itself, to tighten”.  In other words, we can say that sin is a cause, but also that it is  an effect.  In reality, it is both at the same time; it is the same as the necessary, physical  descent, of the soul into the body.  There are two aspects of the same operation: moral  if it is considered, physical if we simply describe it.   The theory of the fall into the sensible world is therefore very complex.   < 142 >  We will compare this conception to that of Plato.  The object of Plato's  philosophy was the resolution of the sensible in intelligible, things in Ideas.  This is the  path of the dialectic.  The reverse process, the descent of the intelligible to the sensible  had been indicated by Plato in mythical form.  What Plotinus did was to take elements  of Platonic philosophy and to restore continuity to them through a process that starts  from the Good and descends to the Ideas, culminating in the sensible world.  The  important part of this procession is the procession of Ideas to the sensible world, and it  is the soul that effects the passage, hence importance of the theory of the Soul in <143>  Plotinus.   There is a World Soul and individual souls.  They play the same role of  lowering the intelligible into the sensible.  Plotinus believed that the main points of this </p><div id="pagenum"><p>409</p></div><p id="page">47   theory are found in Plato, and indeed they are indicated, [p.70] but without being  connected to each other; these are only the stations along the procession.   The Universal Soul is a mixture of divisible essence and indivisible essence  (Timaeus) 98.  According to Plotinus, Plato would have meant that the Soul is the  vehicle of Ideas, being Idea from above and sensible world at the bottom.  Indeed, Plato  presents it neither as creative nor as organizing things: it is a conservative power of  movement.  It is true that for Plotinus, the Universal Soul creates the material world;  but Plato ( Laws, X) already said that the World Soul is prior to all bodies.  Even in  <144> the Timaeus, it is mathematically composed, so that we would be right to put it  among these intermediate essences, between the intelligible and sensible.  Plato  prepares Plotinus for this point of view.   Moreover, we find in the Timaeus the indication of a theory of time, the moving  image of eternity99.  But for Plato, time is primarily the movement of the heavens,  which is maintained by the World Soul: already it is, if not creative, at least supportive  of duration.  In Plotinus, the World Soul is what develops the eternal idea in duration.     For the human soul, there are fewer relationships.  In Plotinus, it is already  something intermediary between the pure idea and the sensible thing, less than one,  more than the other.  And we already find the theory of a fall of the soul into <145> the  body, and the idea that this incarnation is done by a natural process.  Only in Plato are  both theories given without there being reconciliation, one in the Phaedrus , the other in  the Laws100.  In addition, we do not see the exact relationship of the human soul with  the idea: it is relative, but the idea is a kind, the soul is individual.  What is lacking is an  indication of the procession.   Here again Plotinus completed Plato, but he had to part from him.  First, how  can the soul come out of the Idea?  Plotinus’ solution is that it is essential that the Idea  is already individual.  Then the passage becomes easy; the Good generates the Ideas by  radiation and if they are supposed to contain souls virtually they are individual.  It  suffices to assume a fall into time and space <146> in order to pass from the idea to the  soul.   Furthermore, every individual soul is going to end up in a body.  On the other  hand the Universal Soul flourishes in the material world.  However, it is required that  everything that [p.71] comes out of the individual soul to flourish in space and time is  perfectly coordinated with what comes out of the Universal Soul.  But the individual  soul extends one intelligible, the Universal Soul all of the intelligibles: in other words, </p><div id="pagenum"><p>410</p></div><p id="page">48   every intelligible is representative of all the intelligibles; each particular idea of all  other ideas.  Yet, it is an essential point of Plato that everything does not participate in  everything.  <147>  9. The Theory of Consciousness    <148>  We will now take the human soul incarnated in a body and study its main  properties. At the forefront is consciousness.   Plotinus is the only ancient philosopher who has presented a theory of  consciousness, which has even reached the idea of consciousness.  He did not find a  fixed terminology for doing so, hence there are great difficulties, and we understand  that historians of philosophy have made mistakes.   Richter recognizes that the concept of consciousness is at the bottom of many  theories of Plotinus, but believes that he has not made it clear.  Zeller still claims that  Plotinus <149> contradicts himself and sometimes said that pure Intelligence thinks  itself - Vth Ennead -  and sometimes Ist Ennead - that consciousness is only possible  for the imagination.  We believe just the opposite.  Νοῦς is the only one to think itself,  and consciousness implies a set of images: it simply means thinking itself; this is not  being conscious, as we shall see in detail.   Let us try to fully understand the texts taking into account the fact that Plotinus’  terminology is not fixed.   Among the terms that have been translated as consciousness, we find the word  συναίσθησις [conscious perception].  What does that mean?  IV.5.5: “One can say  hearing what we have said about the view; the condition is a συναίσθησις, like that of  the parts of an animal.”  The word here has a clear meaning.  [p.72] But for Plotinus  <150> perception is sympathy of the organ with the object with which it vibrates in  unison.  The word signifies sympathy.  Similarly, I.1.9: "The discursive mind, in  making a choice of impressions coming from the sensation contemplates the Ideas and  contemplates them as a συναίσθησις [conscious perception], because authentic διάνοια  is a likeness and an internal communication with the outside world.”  Again, the  meaning is clear.  Plotinus attributes to διάνοια the role of searching for an Idea within  νοῦς that it approximates to the sensation.   It has this role in perception.  The word  here means the sympathetic communication between διάνοια and the material object  which is going to be picked up within the representation.  Sympathy is the fundamental </p><div id="pagenum"><p>411</p></div><p id="page">49   meaning of the word.  Step by step we are moving towards the meaning of  consciousness.   If it is a sympathy, more particularly it may be the sympathy of the <151> parts  of a being one for the other, their agreement with each other.  IV.4.45: “In an animal,  there is sympathy of each organ towards all the others and of the whole for the whole.”   IV.4.9: “The Universal Soul will no longer be whole; there will be various powers in  the diverse parts of the world; there will be no more συναίσθησις.”  This is already the  more particular sense of consensus, of inner harmony.   In this second sense, we'll go within the meaning of consciousness.  Let us  suppose that for Plotinus consciousness is, from a certain point of view, sympathy, a  harmony between the different parts of the Soul; then the word may mean  consciousness.  In III.8.4, Plotinus attributes to nature a space of slumbering  consciousness: “Nature remains within its <152> own equilibrium and within a sort of  συναίσθησις.”  Here this consciousness is an internal consensus; an equilibrium.   V.3.13: “συναίσθησις is the αἴσθησις [perception] of a plurality.”   The word can  therefore mean consciousness, but it is not the fundamental sense of the word.   We can already see a certain conception of consciousness.  Plotinus fell upon a  quite modern conception of consciousness at the first attempt.  Consciousness is  primarily synthesis, assimilation, sympathetic communication of all parts of the soul.   Contemporary psychology admits increasingly of unconscious states of mind.  For a  state to become conscious there must be assimilation, that we do it within the current of  our personality.  [p.73] Plotinus said that it is something of this kind.  Consciousness  would be a power possessed by the soul. <153>   Plotinus often uses the word άντίληψις [sense perception].  At V.1.12, he asks  himself "how it is that we have certain ideas (justice and beauty) without being aware  of it."  When the part of the soul is not communicating with the part of the soul that  feels, then it does not cross the whole soul; we become conscious of a part of the soul  when there is transmission and consequently άντίληψις.  IV.8.8: “We do not know what  is happening in a part of the soul: it has to have penetrated the whole soul.” This is  Plotinus’ first meaning.   But this is only the least important part of his theory.  Consciousness is  primarily a certain unification of impressions from below, but it is much more a  division <154> of elements, instead of going up, descending.  The soul is an  intermediate essence between νοῦς and the body.  It therefore has two functions: first, </p><div id="pagenum"><p>412</p></div><p id="page">50   to unite the impressions that come from the body and from there into consciousness;  secondly, to bring down the Ideas, again into consciousness.  Consciousness occurs  either by the unification that comes from below, or by division that comes from above.   In the second direction, it is analysis of the Ideas.   IV.3.30.  We constantly participate in pure thinking, in νοῦς, but we are not  conscious of it, “because thought is one thing, consciousness of thought is something  else.  We always think, but we are not fully conscious of it”.  What is necessary for  consciousness to join the thought?  “The pure act of thought is hiding within, having  not yet proceeded to the <155> outside.  But the logos having developed and directed  the imaginative power reveals it as in a mirror: then conscious perception of thought  occurs.”102   Therefore, for the Idea to come into consciousness, it must be coupled with an  image that it is reflected in the imagination, the faculty for forming images with  sensations, and especially keeping them under the gaze of consciousness.   Important passage: I.4.10.  Consciousness is not essential for thought, neither  for virtue or happiness.  The hero does not know he acts with [p.74] courage;  consciousness of an act only weakens the energy.  “The intense life is that which does  not dissolve in feelings.”  How and when does consciousness occur?  “Consciousness  of thought appears to be born when <156> thought bends back on itself and when this  thought which takes place in the direction of the life of the soul is as if it were pushed  backwards, just like the image in a mirror rests on the free and shiny surface… In the  soul, when there is tranquillity of the surface on which images of thought are revealed,  we perceive them and we have so to speak, sensible knowledge.”  Consciousness  occurs when pure thought divides, like falling on a mirror.   We have already found this image of the mirror in the theory of the fall of the  soul.  The soul perceiving its image in matter like in a mirror is seduced and drops.   This is the same image, and basically, it's the same idea.  For him, consciousness is  <157> a transient state, the state of the soul after the fall.  Consciousness is less than  thought, more than mere materiality.  The sphere of consciousness is coextensive with  that of the soul; and this is because it is aware that the soul is superior to materiality and  inferior to pure thought.   It follows that consciousness is coextensive with the life of the soul.  The soul  sits in the intermediate realm between the sensible and the intelligible, and the same for  consciousness, which also remains in the intermediate plane; it is a becoming, progress. </p><div id="pagenum"><p>413</p></div><p id="page">51    In essence it is therefore something unstable.  It is not of being but change.  It is  a movement that can take two directions: sometimes aspiration upwards, sometimes  descent.  This perpetual oscillation in the soul is consciousness. I.1.11: “Consciousness  must occur because we do not always use what we possess: we do use it when we direct  our mean powers either up or down.”  Consciousness is essentially, instability.   It always comes down to saying that it is a deprivation: it is the effect and also a  sign of the fall.  In V.8.11, Plotinus says "To become aware, is to stay out of what is  grasped”.  Plotinus explained that to understand beauty, you must be merged with the  beautiful itself; it is an [p.75] intimate union and sympathy.  Things that fall most  clearly under consciousness are precisely those which are most foreign to us:  thus so,  we are more conscious of disease than health.  “But we are unconscious of ourselves  and the things that are truly ours.  But in this state of unconsciousness we are <159> in  more complete ownership ourselves, of everything that belongs to us, and we are stirred  to make our being coincide with the science of ourselves.”  IV.4.4: “We can possess  something more strongly unconsciously than if we knew; because if we knew we would  possess it as something else, whereas, being unaware, we tend to be at one with what  we have.”  Consciousness always involves an exteriority of the subject relative to the  object.   This is diametrically opposed to the modern conception, according to which  adequate knowledge is consciousness, where there is perfect coincidence of the knower  and the object known, but for Plotinus, consciousness involves externality.   What consequences are to be drawn?  A being that grasps through  consciousness cannot grasp itself.  On the other <160> hand it is the attribute of the  soul and it sits between the sensible and the intelligible.  Therefore, the soul does not  know itself, and this should not be through consciousness.  Plotinus has drawn these  consequences.   Firstly. The soul does not know itself.  V.3.9.  Why should we deny the soul the  power to think itself?  “This is because we have reserved it the function to look outside  and to engage in the unrest.”  The soul is condemned to live externally to itself, never  being fully itself, what it wanted to be.   Secondly, the being that knows itself is pure Intellect.  It thinks itself and it  alone thinks.   What does Plotinus understand <161> by νοῦς?  This is not a faculty of the  soul.  The soul can rise up to Intellect, but on the condition of rising above itself.  </p><div id="pagenum"><p>414</p></div><p id="page">52   Intellect does not sit in souls but is self-sufficient, it exists in itself.  It is something in  which individual souls may participate but is not in the souls.  The Idea is independent  of the soul:  the soul can return with effort to [p.76] the Idea from where it descended.   In V.3.3, Plotinus clearly explains: “The soul falls towards the sensitive life, it rises to  Intellect, but Intellect does not come to it, it is we who ascend Intellect”.   It is basically Plato’s conception, so it is surprising to see the opinion of Zeller  (2nd ed., p. 518).  According to him, one cannot see how νοῦς may be <162> both our  reason and a being above us, nor how the soul distinguishes itself from it radically and  nevertheless defines itself by it.  Souls participate in the world of Ideas to the extent  that they can participate in it; but distinguish themselves from it because they went out  of it; and yet are explained by it because they are their image.  The real difficulty is  rather to understand how this superior Intellect, which is exterior to the soul, and by the  same token a stranger to consciousness, can think itself, furthermore, be alone in  thinking itself.  How is it possible?   Let us first recall why Plotinus puts νοῦς above all consciousness.  I.4.10: "The  activity of νοῦς remains hidden in us because it has nothing to do with the sensible  world, because it is through <163> the intermediary of the sensation that it has to work  on consciousness.  But why wouldn’t νοῦς and Soul that surrounds it, act before the  sensation and generally before consciousness?  For there must be an act prior to  consciousness, because thinking and being are one.”  Thus, for νοῦς thinking and being  are one and νοῦς has no consciousness because it has no sensation.  How will it  understand?   Νοῦς is the κόσμος νοητός [intelligible world].  This world contains all the  Ideas, all of which are related to each other.  Each idea is a νοητός [intelligible]  therefore an object of thought; but on the other hand, each idea contains all other  possible ideas wrapped up in it.  So, one side of each intelligible is one object of  thought <164> and the other contains all the other intelligibles.  But in that capacity can  we therefore not say that it thinks them?  What is thinking if not containing Ideas in  oneself?   Plotinus tells us that in the Intellect there is movement, but this movement is "an  immobile and tranquil movement”, an evolution that for each intelligible consists in  browsing through the whole series of intelligibles; [p.77] but this review does not  occupy time: it all occupies a single moment that is eternity.  There is therefore a  reflection of the idea on itself, and finally a thought that has nothing in common with </p><div id="pagenum"><p>415</p></div><p id="page">53   consciousness of distinct moments that are heterogeneous and successive.  It is this  course of thought by itself that is the thought of νοῦς thinking itself.   Text. V.3.13: “Thought <165> seems to be when a plurality of terms come to  coincide, a συναίσθησις [conscious perception] of everything, while a certain thing  thinks itself, which is strictly speaking νοεῖν [noesis - the exercise of reason].”   The word συναίσθησις here means internal synthesis.  When all the intelligibles  come to blend into each other, then there is the thought of thought.  It is the presence of  all intelligibles in every intelligible that constitutes the thought of thought by itself, the  νοῦς is thinking itself.  If Plato did not name his intelligible world νοῦς, it is because he  did not accept the participation of all the ideas in each other.  If he had accepted it, he  would have called this world νοῦς because the thought of thought would have been  wholly present everywhere to itself, there would have been thought of thought.  That is  why Plotinus has spoken of a thought.   <166>  Thus thinking means penetration of the intelligibles, each by the others.   Let us clarify this idea again, and the theory of consciousness at the same time.   In V.3, Plotinus seeks the required condition for self-knowledge.  He finds it is  only possible by a coincidence of that which knows with what is known.  If there is  only one footprint, then knowledge is imperfect.  For self-knowledge, it must therefore  be an absolutely simple principle that requires the identity of subject and object.  In  sensation, there is knowledge of exterior modifications to the being that senses.  In  discursive intelligence, it either synthesises sensations, and then it is more than  sensation, or it materialises Ideas; but it is always different from what it knows.  Self- knowledge <167> cannot appear to be that which is both νόησις [intelligence,  understanding] and νοητόν [intelligible], that is to say νοῦς.   We discussed the difficulties raised by the problem of consciousness.  To  understand Plotinus’ Idea, we must first make a clean sweep of our current conceptions.   We represent an Idea to ourselves as something subsequent to consciousness.  To  represent it [p.78] as being independent is to project it outside of consciousness.  The  idea is the centre around which consciousness gravitates, and which is given first.   Consciousness is only a diminution.  How could we get to place ourselves in the state  of soul which is that of the Ancients?   Here is the significant idea of identity: A = A.  How I am conscious of it  <168>?  It is because I change constantly, that I constantly pay attention to myself and  this idea at the same time.  Furthermore, I see this idea as an image.  Finally, I'm </p><div id="pagenum"><p>416</p></div><p id="page">54   exterior to it; it is a stranger to me.  So, it is for these three reasons I am conscious at  the same time that I think.  I abstract from that which, at any moment comes back to  me, of these images, of this exteriority, in respect of the Idea.  I have the pure Idea, but  I have, so to speak, coincided with it; I shall participate in its eternity, unconscious in a  sense, and yet coinciding with my thoughts: it thinks itself within the unconscious.   The Greeks took an idea, took it to the state of <169> purity, and saw nothing  more in consciousness than something that comes out diminished.  Because if this idea  is thought thinking outside of time, moving from eternity to time, there is nothing to  add.  It is necessary that Idea degenerates into image, eternity into time, interiority into  exteriority.   This amounts to saying that the ancients did not allocate to consciousness and  the person the eminent dignity that we have attributed to them103.  Putting personal  thoughts at the centre of things is a very modern idea.  For the ancients, consciousness  is intermediate between the intelligible, which is hyperconscious, and the sensible,  which is unconscious.  V.9.7: “It is not because Intellect thinks that the Idea exists, it is  because the Idea exists that Intellect thinks.”  Consciousness is like an accessory.  A  word referring to it incessantly is παρακολούθημα, accompaniment.  It joins the Idea in  its descent, but in the opposite sense to that given to it by modern materialists, for  whom consciousness is superadded to more complex movements of the cerebral  substance; consequently, it is something inferior to it.  In contrast, for Plotinus, it is an  attenuation of something superior to it.  It is not phosphorescence [emission of light  without any perceptible heat] that illuminates the movement; it is darkness, a shadow  that the Idea projects below it.                        </p><div id="pagenum"><p>417</p></div><p id="page">55   [p.263] Notes  All references to Bergson’s works are given in the text of the Centennial Edition, Paris,  PUF, 1959.  Notes on  The Lectures on Plotinus    PRELIMINARY NOTE    Bergson * indicated to a German translation of Mueller, extracts translated into English  and to the French translation of Bouillet.  He was very critical of the latter: “it is less a  translation than a paraphrase”- he hardly uses it when quoting passages of Plotinus; at  least we find no literal quotation from Bouillet’s translation of it.  Bergson was a good  Hellenist and the late Philippe Soulez had a French translation of book A of Aristotle's  Metaphysics done by Bergson himself.  It is most likely that Bergson translates directly  from Greek to French.  When it seemed useful to refer to the Enneads text itself, it is É.  Bréhiers’ translation which is cited.  At this time (1996), a new translation of the  Enneads is currently being published, by P. Hadot (three volumes published, Treatise  38, Paris, 1988 Treatise 50, Paris, 1990 Treatise 9, Paris, 1994).    1. “Plotinus is a Greek uniquely inspired Greeks."  This is a point on which Bergson  hesitated.  The course of Clermont-Ferrand, vol. IV, p.147, reflects on the  influence of the Christianity; the course at the Lycée Henri IV, in the same  volume, p.146, ms. P.192-117 reflects more on the influence of Judaism; this  course at the École Normale Supérieure supports the contrary thesis of Hellenic  autarky [The word "autarky" is from the Greek: αὐτάρκεια, which means "self- sufficiency"]; Bergson’s latest position on this point can be found in Two Sources  of Morality and Religion , p.1161:  “The philosophy of Plotinus, in which the  development culminates, and which owes as much to Aristotle as it does to Plato,  is unquestionably mystic.  If it has undergone the influence of Eastern thought, so  very much alive in the Alexandrian world, this occurred without the knowledge of  Plotinus himself, who thought he was merely condensing all Greek philosophy,  with the whole object of opposing it to foreign doctrines.”[A. Audra and C  Brereton translation, p.219]    2. Porphyre, Vie de Plotin , ed. and trans., É. Bréhier  in Éditions des Belles Lettres,  en tête de l’Ennéade I, p. 1-31.  See also: J.

Lasserre, Berlin, 1996.    5. “A system which combines all the principal ideas of Greek philosophy.”  This  synthetic thesis sheds light on Bergson's understanding of Greek philosophy.  It  helps to clarify the meaning of his attention to Plotinus; not only attention on a  particular author, but wholly on an author who condenses in himself and  summarizes all the Greek philosophy.  Having thus reduced the infinite historical  diversity to the determined and the finite, Bergson goes out of mere scholarship  and gives a critical and resolute judgment, not only on Greek philosophy, but on  all those who, at least at times, withdrew, “hardly having done little more than  repeating Plotinus” ( Mélanges , p. 1076).

With the mention of "Gordian", we can assume a  reference to the Life of Plotinus, §. 3:  his interest in Persian and Indian thought  motivates Plotinus to follow the Emperor Gordian to Persia; “…but Gordian was  defeated in Mesopotamia. Plotinus barely escaped and fled to Antioch.”    12. Hegel, in his history of philosophy praises courtiers for not having allowed the  founding of Platonopolis.    13. On Amelius: L.

That of Plotinus, of course.  We leave these tracks of speaking style, where the  word translated a living thought, following its idea without caring about  "reattaching the [railway] carriages."   </p><div id="pagenum"><p>419</p></div><p id="page">57   15. Although the writing is not very legible, the manuscript seems to be: “Everything  he experienced”.  Either there is an accidental slip of the tongue for “everything  he wrote", or that is what Bergson thought; either way the slip of the tongue is  revealing.    16.

One can compare the whole paragraph with Creative Evolution , p.578    31. A word is missing in the manuscript. One can compensate, perhaps, with  "decline", which would then be taken up a few lines down. See below, n.33.    32.

"Ecstasy is a form of sympathy, but not the only one."  One can take on the living  progress of Bergsonian thought by comparing this phrase with those of the lesson  on the ‘Alexandrian School’, ms. p. 184, vol. IV, p. 149.  It is by such phrases that  one understands the organic unity of Bergson's thought through its development.  See, for example. Introduction, p. 8-9.    36. A word is missing in the manuscript.    37. See note 38.    38. It is in fact a treatise of Porphyry sent to Iamblichus; the closest passage that  Bergson quotes is found in Stobaeus, XXI, 27, Commentary on Alcibiades ,  preface (ed. Segonds, Part 1, p.3-7).  It does not seem that the idea appears in the  Commentary on the Timaeus .    39. Ennead II.9.6.    40. Ennead IV.8.1.    41. Ennead II.4. 7.    42. Ibid.    43. Ennead IV.7.8.    44. Ennead V.4.    45. Ennead V.1.8: “Therefore our theories are nothing new and they are not modern;  they were laid down long ago, but not developed and we are now the exegetes  (interpreters) of these old doctrines, whose antiquity is testified by Plato’s  writings.    46. The manuscript states: didactique     47. Phaedrus , 259 b-d.    48. Republic, III, 415 a-b.    49. Phaedrus , 246 a-d.    50. One can easily imagine that it is precisely this mythical part which was of most  interest to Bergson since it deals with becoming that is not reduced to fixed Ideas.   On the last sentence of this paragraph, see the end of the lesson on Zeno in the  Black Notebook: "Anyway, you should always accept, in the presence of motion,  either that reality is absurd or it is an illusion"(ms. P.35, vol. IV, p.179).    51. L. Couturat’s latin thesis, De platonicis mythis , 1986.   </p><div id="pagenum"><p>421</p></div><p id="page">59   52. Ennead IV.2.2.    53. Here is the sentence in question. As Plotinus quotes it: "In the indivisible essence  and always identical to itself, essence becomes divisible in bodies, the demiurge  made in mixing them, a third form of essence as space"(Timaeus, 69 d)    54. In this phrase the term ‘wholly’ [ tout] does not appear in the manuscript.    55. Ennead III.5.9.  One can compare with text translated by Bréhier: “Myths, if they  are really myths, separate the circumstances of the story in time, and often  distinguish between beings that are confused and not distinguished by their rank  or their powers ... but after we have been educated myths can teach, leaving us  free, if we have understood them, to reunite their scattered data.”    [p.266]    56. Ennead V.7.1.    57. The manuscript reads: "It is basically the modern approach.”  It is also Bergson’s  in Creative Evolution , p.489-490.    58. Illuminating sentence for understanding the suture between Matter and Memory   and Creative Evolution , as two aspects of the same problem; personal  consciousness is first placed in the conditions of life of the individual ( M & M),  then in the more general conditions of the whole system of living beings ( EC).    59. One easily recognises here the two ready-made garments which are spoken of in  Creative Evolution , p.493.   But let's not jump to conclusions without having read  Lesson 9 of this course and in particular the last pages.    60. Stobaeus, Ecolgae Philosophorum , 4 vol., repr. Berlin, ed. C. Wachsmuth, O.  Hense, Berlin, 5 vol., 1884-1923; repr. in 4 vol., 1958, Part I, p. 488.    61. Timaeus, 34d-36e.    62. Bergson said otherwise in his lectures on ‘The History of Greek Philosophy’ at  the Lycée Henri IV, ms. P 192-117, Vol IV, p.146: "We recognize without  difficulty the ψυχή of the Stoics in the World Soul (of Plotinus) ". Both assertions  are perhaps not as opposed as it seems. As judgments on the history of ideas,  there was undoubtedly a transition from one thesis to its opposite.  But as these  Plotinian themes serve to support the reflection of Bergson himself, this evolution  shows a deepening of his thinking more than the development of his erudition and  its exegesis.  The first point of view is largely integrated in Matter and Memory   and the second is already moving in the direction of Creative Evolution  and  perhaps leaves the area of research which will be the one of the Two Sources .    63. Hypothetical sentence. The manuscript reads: "But this defect in production  within becoming, logos has not gained the upper hand, but what wins out is a  deterioration of the idea that the logos accidentally brought with it."- This does  not seem intelligible. </p><div id="pagenum"><p>422</p></div><p id="page">60   64. Under this title Bergson quotes the Aphormai pros ta noeta (“Starting points for  the intelligibles”), better known by its Latin title Sententiae Ad Intelligibilia  Ducentes, ed. E. Lamberz, Leipzig, 1975.    65. Ennead II.3.17: “This matter is like the bitter deposit left by higher beings; it  spreads this bitterness and communicates it to the universe.” - Note that the term  "bitter dregs" used by Bergson, may be borrowed from the translation of Bouillet  (vol.1, p.192): “The matter of which it (the universe) is composed is in a way the  bitter dregs of the higher principles…”.    66. The word remote has been added by the editor.    67. Ennead III.6.19.    68. A word is missing in the manuscript.    69. Ennead II.3.18: “The Universal Soul must contemplate the great beings and  always bear towards intelligible nature and to God.”    70. The whole sentence is: “διενόθη, ȍ όυ νοῦ ἒργον ἀλλά  ψυχῇς μεριστήν ἐνέργειαν  ἔχει ἐν μεριστῇ  φύσει”,  “Reflection is not the function of the Intellect, but of the  Soul whose act is divided in a divisible Nature”.    71. Essai sur les données immédiates de la conscience  (Time and Free Will ), p. 133- 134.  See also the Lecture on Spinoza in Cours, Vol. III , p.86-89.    72. We can compare this expression of the widening of perception with that discussed  in La pensée et le mouvant , “La perception du changement” (“The Perception of  Change”), p. 1370.    73. Bergson has already alluded to the text above, see n.34.    [p.267]    74. Ennead VI.9.9.    75. Ennead VI.9.9.    76. E. Zeller, La philosophie des Grecs , III, 2, Plotinus, S 4, ‘Nous’.  Bergson is often  critical of Zeller in this course, ms. P.81, 91, 124, 161, etc.  It does not prevent  him from being very indebted to him, as we shall sometimes indicate.  Moreover,  read, a complimentary note on Zeller about his ideas on Socrates, infra in the  hand-written notebook, p.81.  It reminds us that the background of the education  Bergson received in Greek philosophy consists of Émile Boutroux’s courses at the  École Normale Supérieure - three volumes ( Lectures on Socrates, Lectures on  Plotinus, Lectures on Aristotle ) have been published in recent years by Éditions  Universitaires with the help of Jérôme de Gramont.  Just after the war of 1870  Boutroux was Zeller’s student, and he even translated the first volume of his  Philosophie der Griechen  into French.  It would also be interesting to carefully  compare the two methods used by Bergson and Boutroux in their history of </p><div id="pagenum"><p>423</p></div><p id="page">61   philosophy.  Neither of them separates scholarship and speculation. They want to  find every historical thought as both a living thought and as a possible truth,  within the framework of a debate where exegesis remains constantly deployed  together with a questioning of the content.  But in doing so, Boutroux, having a  more discreet personality, a community attitude and an approach that so subtly  insinuates, it is often unclear about what he thinks. Conversely, Bergson is more  personally committed and mobilises thinkers to favour his way of thinking.    77. For an essay about the genesis of bodies, see Creative Evolution , p. 653.    78. Which is the Bergsonian meaning, see Creative Evolution , p.718, note p. 722-723.    79. Bréhier translated this passage IV, 4, 19 as: "Pain is knowledge of a weakening of  the body, being deprived of the image which it possesses; pleasure is the  knowledge that the animal has of the reinstallation of the soul in the image of the  body."    80. Ennead IV.4.4.    81. Ennead IV.4.6.  This is probably the most anti-Zenonian (in Bergson’s terms) of  Plotinus’ texts that can support the theory of the ancient influence of Plotinus on  Bergson.    82. Ennead IV.4.24: "We must therefore give it (the universe) an intimate sense of  itself similar to the one we have of ourselves."    83. Regarding the presentation and critique of these concepts, see, for example,  Mélanges , p. 1056 and 1059.    84. Aphormai , see n.64 above.    85. Creative Evolution , p. 413-414.    86. Ibid.    87. We agree that the preceding pages are a document of prime importance and  irreplaceable for immediately grasping the genesis of the theses of Creative  Evolution .    88. Here is the translation of Bréhier: “The arrival of the souls is not voluntary and  they have not been sent; or at least their will does not consist of a will of choice;  they move towards the body without reflection, like jumping from instinct, or like  the inclination without reflection to desire marriage.”    89. The underlined expressions are Bergson’s notes, which he inserts into the  quotation.    90. Ennead III.1.8.  91. See Bergson’ own bibliography, ms. p.27-28, Vol. IV, p.26-28.   </p><div id="pagenum"><p>424</p></div><p id="page">62   92. An illegible word. Substitute with generates or produces.    93. Compare with Bouillet’s translation: "Empedocles said that it is a law for sinful  souls to fall down here, that he himself is far from God and came to earth to be  the slave of furious discord."    [p.268]    94. Bergson is probably referring here to Ennead IV.8.6, but the reference is not very  clear.    95. Read Ennead IV.3.6.    96. Ennead IV.7.1-2.    97. Sic.     98. Timaeus, 34 d-e.    99. Timaeus, 37 d.    100. Phaedrus , 248 a - 249 b; Laws, X, 892 a - 899 d.    101. Bergson has already quoted this passage above and the following, ‘Lectures on  Plotinus’, ms. P. 103-104.    102. The two sentences quoted by Bergson are in the reverse order in Plotinus’ text.    One could not better mark the distance between Plotinus and Bergson than he has done  himself.     </p><div id="pagenum"><p>425</p></div></div></div>
