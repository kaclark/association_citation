We are good at it. So good, we  often forget to put the pieces back together again.  This skill is perhaps most finely honed in science. There we  not only routinely break problems down into bite-sized chunks  and mini-chunks, we then very often isolate each one from its  environment by means of a useful trick. We say ceteris par­ ibus-all other things being equal. In this way we can ignore  the complex interactions between our problem and the rest of  the universe.  llya Prigogine, who won the Nobel Prize in 1977 for his  work on the thermodynamics of nonequilibrium systems, is  net satisfied, however, with merely taking things apart. He has  spent the better part of a lifetime trying to "put the pieces  back together again"-the pieces in this case being biology  and physics, necessity and chance, science and humanity .  Born in Russia in 1917 and raised in Belgium since the age  of ten, Prigogine is a compact man with gray hair, cleanly chis­ eled features, and a laserlike intensity. Deeply interested in  archaeolo gy, art, and history, he brings to science a remark­ able polymathic mind. He lives with his engineer-wife, Ma­ rina, and his son, Pascal, in Brussels, where a cross­ disciplinary team is busy exploring the implications of his  ideas in fields as disparate as the social behavior of ant colo­ nies, diffusion reactions in chemical systems and dissipative  processes in quantum field theory.  He spends part of each year at the Ilya Prigogine Center for  Statistical Mechanics and Thermodynamics of the University  of Texas in Austin. To his evident delight and surprise, he was  xi </p><div id="pagenum"><p>12</p></div><p id="page">ORDER OUT OF CHAOS xii  awarded the Nobel· Prize for his work on "dissipative struc­ tures" arising out of nonlinear processes in nonequilibrium  systems. The coauthor of this volume, Isabelle Stengers, is a  philosopher , chemist, and historian of science who served for  a time as part of Prigogine 's Brussels team. She now lives in  Paris and is associated with the Musee de Ia Villette.  In Order Out of Chaos they have given us a landmark-a  work that is contentious and mind-energizing, a book filled  with flashing insights that subvert many of our most basic as­ sumptions and suggest fresh ways to think about them.  Under the title La nouvelle alliance, its appearance in  France in 1979 triggered a marvelous scientific free-for-all  among prestigious intellectuals in fields as diverse as entomol­ ogy and literary criticism.  It is a measure of America's insularity and cultural ar­ rogance that this book, which is either published or about to  be published in twelve languages, has taken so long to cross  the Atlantic. The delay carries with it a silver lining, however,  in that this edition includes Prigogine 's newest findings, par­ ticularly with respect to the Second Law of thermodynamic s,  which he sets into a fresh perspectiv e.  For all these reasons, Order Out of Chaos is more than just  another book: It is a lever for changing science itself, for com­ pelling us to reexamine its goals, its methods, its epistemol­ ogy-its world view. Indeed, this book can serve as a symbol  of today's historic transformation in science-one that no in­ formed person can afford to ignore.  Some scholars picture science as driven by its own internal  logic, developing according to its own laws in splendid isola­ tion from the world around it. Yet many scientific hypothese s,  theories, metaphors, and models (not to mention the choices  made by scientists either to study or to ignore various prob­ lems) are shaped by economic, cultural, and political forces  · operating outside the laboratory.  I do not mean to suggest too neat a parallel between the nature  of society and the reigning scientific world view or "paradigm."  Still less would I relegate science to some "superstruc ture,.  mounted atop a socioeconomic "base," as Marxists are wont to  do. But science is not an "independent variable.'' It is an open  system embedded in society and linked to it by very dense feed­ back loops. It is powerfully influenced by its external environ-</p><div id="pagenum"><p>13</p></div><p id="page">xiii FOREWORD: SCIENCE AND CHANGE  ment, and, in a general way, its development is shaped by cultural  receptivity to its dominant ideas.  Take that body of ideas that came together in the seven­ teenth and eighteenth centuries under the heading of "classi­ cal science" or "Newtonian ism." They pictured a world in  which every event was determined by initial conditions that  were, at least in principle, determinable with precision. It was  a world in which chance played no part, in which all the pieces  came together like cogs in a cosmic machine.  The acceptance of this mechanistic view coincided with the  rise of a factory civilization. And divine dice-shooting seems  hardly enough to account for the fact that the Age of the Ma­ chine enthusiastically embraced scientific theories that pic­ tured the entire universe as a machine.  This view of the world led Laplace to his famous claim that,  given enough facts, we could not merely predict the future but  retrodict the past. And this image of a simple, uniform; me­ chanical universe not only shaped the development of science,  it also spilled over into many other fields. It influenced the  framers of the American Constitution to create a machine for  governing, its checks and balances clicking like parts of a  clock. Metternich , when he rode forth to create his balance of  power in Europe, carried a copy of Laplace's writings in his  baggage. And the dramatic spread of factory civilization, with  its vast clanking machines, its heroic engineering break­ throughs, the rise of the railroad, and new industries such as  steel, textile, and auto, seemed merely to confirm the image of  the universe as an engineer' s Tinkertoy.  Today, however, the Age of the Machine is screeching to a  halt, if ages can screech-and ours certainly seems to. And  the decline of the industrial age forces us to confront the pain­ ful limitations of the machine model of reality.  Of course, most of these limitations are not freshly dis­ covered. The notion that the world is a clockwork, the planets  timelessly orbiting, all systems operating deterministically in  equilibrium, all subject to universal laws that an outside ob­ server could discover-this model has come under withering  fire ever since it first arose.  In the early nineteenth century, thermodynamics chal­ lenged the timelessness implied in the mechanistic image of  the universe. If the world was a big machine, the ther­ modynamicists declared, it was running down, its useful en-</p><div id="pagenum"><p>14</p></div><p id="page">ORDER OUT OF CHAOS xiv  ergy leaking out. It could not go on forever, and time,  therefore, took on a new meaning. Darwin's followers soon  introduced a contradictory thought: The world-machine might  be running down, losing energy and organization, but biolog­ ical systems, at least, were running up, becoming more, not  less, organized.  By the early twentieth century , Einstein had come along to  put the observer back into the system: The machine looked  different-indeed, for all practical purposes it was different­ depending upon where you stood within it. But it was still a  deterministic machine, and God did not throw dice. Next, the  quantum people and the uncertainty folks attacked the model  with pickaxes, sledgehammers, and sticks of dynamite.  Nevertheless, despite all the ifs, ands, and buts, it remains  fair to say, as Prigogine and Stengers do, that the machine par­ adigm is still the "reference point" for physics and the core  model of science in general. Indeed, so powerful is its con­ tinuing influence that much of social science, and especially  economics, remains under its spell.  The importance of this book is not simply that it uses orig­ inal arguments to challenge the Newtonian model, but also  that it shows how the still valid, though much limited, claims  of Newtonian ism might fit compatibly into a larger scientific  image of reality. It argues that the old "universal laws" are not  universal at all, but apply only to local regions of reality. And  these happen to be the regions to which science has devoted  the most effort.  Thus, in broad-str oke terms, Prigogine and Stengers argue  that traditional science in the Age of the Machine tended to  emphasize stability, order, uniformity, and equilibrium. It con­ cerned itself mostly with closed systems and linear relation­ ships in which small inputs uniformly yield small results.  With the transition from an industrial society based on  heavy inputs of energy, capital, and labor to a high-technology  society in which information and innovation are the critical  resources, it is not surprising that new scientific world models  should appear.  What makes the Prigoginian paradigm especially interesting  is that it shifts attention to those aspects of reality that charac­ terize today's accelerated social change: disorder, instability,  diversity, disequilibrium, nonlinear relationships (in which </p><div id="pagenum"><p>15</p></div><p id="page">xv FOREWORD: SCIENCE AND CHANGE  small inputs can trigger massive consequences) , and tem­ porality-a heightened sensitivity to the flows of time.  The work of Ilya Prigogine and his colleagues in the so­ called "Brussels school" may well represent the next revolu­ tion in science as it enters into a new dialogue not merely with  nature, but with society itself.  The ideas of the Brussels school, based heavily on Pri­ gogine's work, add up to a novel, comprehensive theory of  change.  Summed up and simplified, they hold that while some parts of  the universe may operate like machines, these are closed systems,  and closed systems, at best, form only a small part of the physical  universe. Most phenomena of interest to us are, in fact, open  systems, exchanging energy or matter (and, one might add, infor­ mation) with their environment. Surely biological and social sys­ tems are open, which means that the attempt to understand them  in mechanistic terms is doomed to failure.  This suggests, moreover, that most of reality, instead of  being orderly, stable, and equilibria!, is seething and bubbling  with change, di sorder, and process.  In Prigoginian terms, all systems contain subsystems,  which are continual ly "fluctuating." At times, a single fluctua­ tion or a combination of them may become so powerful, as a  result of positive feedback, that it shatters the preexisting or­ ganization. At this revolutionary moment-the authors call it  a "singular moment" or a "bifurcation point"-it is inherently  impossible to determine in advance which direction change  will take: whether the system will disintegrate into "chaos" or  leap to a new, more differentiated, higher level of "order" or  organiza tion, which they call a "dissipative structure." (Such  physical or chemical structures are termed dissipative be­ cause, compared with the simpler structures they replace, they  require more energy to sustain them.)  One of the key controversies surrounding this concept has  to do with Prigogine's insistence that order and organization  can actual ly arise "spontaneously" out of disorder and chaos  through a process of "self-organiza tion."  To grasp this extremely powerful idea. we first need to make  a distinction between systems that are in "equilibri um," sys-</p><div id="pagenum"><p>16</p></div><p id="page">ORDER OUT OF CHAOS xvi  terns that are "near equilibrium," and systems that are "far  from equilibrium."  Imagine a primitive tribe. If its birthrate and death rate are  equal, the size of the population remains stable. Assuming ad­ equate food and other resources, the tribe forms part of a local  system in ecological equilibrium.  Now increase the birthrate. A few additional births (without  an equivalent number of deaths) might have little effect. The  system may move to a near-equilibria! state. Nothing much  happens. It takes a big jolt to produce big consequences in  systems that are in equilibria] or near-equilibria] states.  But if the birthrate should suddenly soar, the system is  pushed into a far-from-equilibrium condition, and here non­ linear relationships prevail. In this state, systems do strange  things. They become inordinately sensitive to external influ­ ences. Small inputs yield huge, startling effects. The entire  system may reorganize itself in ways that strike us as bizarre.  Examples of such self-reorganization abound in Order Out  of Chaos. Heat moving evenly through a liquid suddenly, at a  certain threshold, converts into a convection current that radi­ cally reorganizes the liquid, and millions of molecule s, as if on  cue, suddenly form themselves into hexagonal cells.  Even more spectacula r are the "chemical clocks" described  by Prigogine and Stengers . Imagine a million white ping-pong  balls mixed at random with a million black ones, bouncing  around chaotically in a tank with a glass win dow in it. Most of  the time, the mass seen through the window would appear to  be gray, but now and then, at irregular moments, the sample  seen through the glass might seem black or white, depending  on the distribution of the balls at that moment in the vicinity of  the window.  Now imagine that suddenly the window goes all white, then  all black, then all white again, and on and on, changing its  color completely at fixed intervals-l ike a clock ticking.  Why do all the white balls and all the black ones suddenly  organize themselves to change color in time with one another?  By all the traditional rules, this should not happen at all. Yet, if  we leave ping-pong behind and look at molecules in certain chemi­ cal reactions, we find that precisely such a self-organization or  ordering can and does occur--despite what classical physics and  the probability theories of Boltzmann tell us.  In far-from-equilibrium situations other seemingly spon-</p><div id="pagenum"><p>17</p></div><p id="page">xvii FOREWORD: SCIENCE AND CHANGE  taneous, often dramatic reorganizations of matter within time  and space also take place. And if we begin thinking in terms of  two or three dimensions, the number and variety of such pos·  sible structures become very great.  Now add to this an additional discovery. Imagine a situation  in which a chemical or other reaction produces an enzyme  whose presence then encourages further production of the  same enzyme. This is an example of what computer scientists  would call a positive-feedback loop. In chemistry it is called  "auto-cata lysis." Such situations are rare in inorganic chemis·  try. But in recent decades the molecular biolo gists have found  that such loops (along with inhibitory or "negative" feedback  and more complicated "cross-catalytic" processes) are the  very stuff of life itself. Such processes help explain how we go  from little lumps of DNA to complex living organisms.  More generally, therefore, in far-from-equilibrium condi­ tions we find that very small perturbations or fluctuations can  become amplified into gigantic, structure-breaking waves.  And this sheds light on all sorts of "qualitative" or "revolu·  tionary" change proce sses. When one combines the new in­ sights gained from studying far-from-equilibrium states and  nonlinear processes, along with these complica ted feedback  systems, a whole new approach is opened that makes it possi­ ble to relate the so-called hard sciences to the softer sciences  of life-and perhaps even to social processes as well.  (Such findings have at least analogical significance for so­ cial, economic or political realities. Words like "revolution,"  "economic crash," "technological upheaval," and "paradigm  shift" all take on new shades of meaning when we begin think­ ing of them in terms of fluctuations, feedback amplifica tion,  dissipative structures, bifurcations, and the rest of the Prigogi­ nian conceptual vocabulary.) It is these panoramic vistas that  are opened to us by Order Out of Chaos.  Beyond this, there is the even more puzzling, pervasive is·  sue of time.  Part of today's vast revolution in both science and culture is  a reconsideration of time, and it is important enough to merit a  brief digression here before returning to Prigogine's role in it.  Take history, for example. One of the great contributions to  historiography has been Braudel's division of time into three  scales-" geographical time," in which events occur over the </p><div id="pagenum"><p>18</p></div><p id="page">ORDER OUT OF CHAOS xviii  course of aeons; the much shorter "social time" scale by  which economies, states, and civilizations are measured; and  the even shorter scale of "individual time"-the history of  human events.  In social science, time remains a largely unmapped terrain.  Anthropology has taught us that cultures differ sharply in the  way they conceive of time. For some, time is cyclical-history  endlessly recurrent. For other cultures, our own included,  time is a highway stretched between past and future, and peo­ ple or whole societies march along it. In still other cultures,  human lives are seen as stationary in time; the future advances  toward us, instead of us toward it.  Each society , as I've written elsewhere, betrays its own  characteristic "time bias"-the degree to which it places em­ phasis on past, present, or future. One lives in the past. An­ other may be obsessed with the future.  Moreover, each culture and each person tends to think in  terms of "time horizons." Some of us think only of the imme­ diate-the now. Politicians, for example, are often criticized  for seeking only immediate, short-term results. Their time  horizon is said to be influenced by the date of the next elec­ tion. Others among us plan for the long term. These differing  time horizons are an overlooked source of social and political  friction-pe rhaps among the most important.  But despite the growing recognition that cultural con­ ceptions of time differ, the social sciences have developed little  in the way of a coherent theory of time. Such a theory might  reach across many disciplines, from politics to group dynam­ ics and interpersonal psycholo gy. It might, for example, take  account of what, in Future Shock, I called "durational expec­ tancies"-our culturally induced assumptions about how long  certain processes are supposed to take.  We learn very early, for example, that brushing one's teeth  should last only a few minutes, not an entire morning, or that  when Daddy leaves for work, he is likely to be gone approx­ imately eight hours, or that a "mealtime" may last a few min­ utes or hours, but never a year. (Television, with its division of  the day into fixed thirty-or sixty-minute intervals, subtly  shapes our notions of duration. Thus we normally expect the  hero in a melodrama to get the girl or find the money or win  the war in the last five minutes. In the United States we expect </p><div id="pagenum"><p>19</p></div><p id="page">xix FOREWORD: SCIENCE AND CHANGE  commercials to break in at certain intervals.) Our minds are  filled with such durational assumptions. Those of children are  much different from those of fully socialized adults, and here  again the differences are a source of conflict.  Moreover, children in an industrial society are "time  trained"-they learn to read the clock, and they learn to dis­ tinguish even quite small slices of time, as when their parents  tell them, "You've only got three more minutes till bedtime!"  These sharply honed temporal skills are often absent in  slower-moving agrarian societies that require less precision in  daily scheduling than our time-obsessed society.  Such concepts, which fit within the social and individual  time scales of Braude!, have never been systematically de­ veloped in the social sciences. Nor have they, in any signifi­ cant way, been articulated with our scientific theories of time,  even though they are necessar ily connected with our assump­ tions about physical reality. And this brings us back to Pri­ gogine, who has been fascinated by the concept of time since  boyhood. He once said to me that, as a young student, he was  struck by a grand contradiction in the way science vie wed  time, and this contradiction has been the source of his life's  work ever since.  In the world model constructed by Newton and his fol­ lowers, time was an afterthou ght. A moment, whether in the  present, past, or future, was assumed to be exactly like any  other moment. The endless cycling of the planets-indeed,  the operations of a clock or a simple machine-can, in princi­ ple, go either backward or forward in time without altering the  basics of the system. For this reason, scientists refer to time in  Newtonian systems as "reversible."  In the nineteenth century, however, as the main focus of  physics shifted from dynamics to thermodynamics and the  Second Law of thermodynamics was proclaimed, time sud­ denly became a central concern. For, according to the Second  Law, there is an inescapable loss of energy in the universe.  And, if the world machine is really running down and ap­ proaching the heat death, then it follows that one moment is no  longer exactly like the last. You cannot run the universe back­ ward to make up for entropy. Events over the long term cannot  replay themselv es. And this means that there is a direc­ tionality or, as Eddington later called it, an "arrow" in time. </p><div id="pagenum"><p>20</p></div><p id="page">ORDER OUT OF CHAOS xx  The whole universe is, in fact, aging. And, in turn, if this is  true, time is a one-way street. It is no longer reversible, but  irreversible.  In short, with the rise of thermod ynamics, science split  down the middle with respect to time. Worse yet, even those  who saw time as irreversible soon also split into two camps.  After all, as energy leaked out of the system, its ability to  sustain organized structures weakened, and these, in turn,  broke down into less organized, hence more random ele­ ments. But it is precisely organiza tion that gives any system  internal diversity . Hence, as entropy drained the system of en­ ergy, it also reduced the differences in it. Thus the Second  Law pointed toward an increasingly homogeneous-and, from  the human point of view, pessimistic- future.  Imagine the problems introduced by Darwin and his fol­ lowers! For evolution, far from pointing toward reduced organ­ ization and diversity, points in the opposite direction.  Evolution proceeds from simple to complex, from "lower" to  "higher" forms of life, from undifferentiated to differentiated  structures. And, from a human point of view, all this is quite  optimistic. The universe gets "better" organized as it ages,  continually advancing to a higher level as time sweeps by.  In this sense, scientific views of time may be summed up as  a contradiction within a contradiction.  It is these paradoxes that Prigogine and Stengers set out to  illuminate, asking, "What is the specific structure of dynamic  systems which permits them to 'distinguish' between past and  future? What is the minimum complexity involved?"  The answer, for them, is that time makes its appearance  with randomne ss: "Only when a system behaves in a suffi­ ciently random way may the difference between past and fu­ ture, and therefore irreversibility , enter its descripti on."  In classical or mechanistic science, events begin with "ini­ tial condition s," and their atoms or particles follow "world  lines" or trajectories. These can be traced either backward  into the past or forward into the future. This is just the op­ posite of certain chemical reactions, for example, in which two  liquids poured into the same pot diffuse until the mixture is  uniform or homogeneou s. These liquids do not de-diffuse  themselves. At each moment of time the mixture is different,  the entir e process is "time-orient ed."  For classical science, at least in its early stages, such pro-</p><div id="pagenum"><p>21</p></div><p id="page">xxi FOREWORD: SCIENCE AND CHANGE  cesses were regarded as anomalies, peculiarities that arose  from highly unlikely initial conditions.  It is Prigogine and Stengers' thesis that such time-depen­ dent, one-way processes are not merely aberrations or devia­ tions from a world in which time is irreversible. If anything,  the opposite might be true, and it is reversible time, associated  with "closed systems" (if such, indeed, exist in reality), that  may well be the rare or aberrant phenomenon.  What is more, irreversible processes are the source of  order-hence the title Order Out of Chaos. It is the processes  associated with randomness, openness, that lead to higher lev­ els of organization, such as dissipative structures.  Indeed, one of the key themes of this book is its striking  reinterpretation of the Second Law of thermodyna mics. For  according to the authors, entropy is not merely a downward  slide toward disorganiza tion. Under certain conditions, en­ tropy itself becomes the progenitor of order.  What the authors are proposing, therefore, is a vast syn­ thesis that embraces both reversible and irreversible time, and  shows how they relate to one another, not merely at the level of  macroscopic phenomena, but at the most minute level as well.  It is a breathtaking attempt at "putting the pieces back to­ gether again." The argument is complex, and at times beyond  easy reach of the lay reader. But it flashes with fresh insight  and suggests a coherent way to relate seemingly uncon­ nected-even contradictory-philosophical concepts.  Here we begin to glimpse, in full richness, the monumental  synthesis proposed in these pages. By insisting that irrevers­ ible time is not a mere aberrat ion, but a characte ristic of much  of the universe, they subvert classical dynamic s. For Pri­ gogine and Stengers, it is not a case of either/or. Of course,  reversibility still applies (at least for sufficiently long times)­ but in closed systems only. Irreversibility applies to the rest of  the universe.  Prigogine and Stengers also undermine conventional views  of thermodynamics by showing that, under nonequilibrium  conditio ns, at least, entropy may produce, rather than de­ grade, order, organization-and therefore life.  If this is so, then entropy, too, loses its either/or character.  While certain systems run down, other systems simul­ taneously evolve and grow more coherent. This mutualistic, </p><div id="pagenum"><p>22</p></div><p id="page">ORDER OUT OF CHAOS xxii  nonexclusive view makes it possible for biology and physics to  coexist rather than merely contradict one another.  Finally, yet another profound synthesis is implied-a new  relationship between chance and necessity.  The role of happenstance in the affairs of the universe has  been debated, no doubt, since the first Paleolithic warrior ac­ cidently tripped over a rock. In the Old Testament, God's will  is sovereign, and He not only controls the orbiting planets but  manipulates the will of each and every individual as He sees  fit. As Prime Mover, all causality flows from Him, and all  events in the universe are foreordained. Sanguinary conflicts  raged over the precise meaning of predestination or free will,  from the time of Augustine through the Carolingian quarrels.  Wycliffe, Huss, Luther, Calvin-all contributed to the debate.  No end of interpreters attempted to reconcile determinism  with freedom of will. One ingenious view held that God did  indeed determine the affairs of the universe, but that with re­ spect to the free will of the individual, He never demanded a  specific action. He merely preset the range of options avail­ able to the human decision-maker. Free will downstairs oper­ ated only within the limits of a menu determined upstairs.  In the secular culture of the Ma chine Age, hard-line deter­ minism has more or less held sway even after the challenges of  Heisenberg and the "uncertaintists ." Even today, thinkers  such as Rene Thorn reject the idea of chance as illusory and  inherently unscientific.  Faced with such philosophical stonewalling, some defenders  of free will, spontaneity , and ultimate uncertainty , especially  the existentialists, have taken equally uncompromising stands.  (For Sartre, the human being was "completely and always  free," though even Sartre, in certain writings, recognized  practical limitations on this freedom.)  Two things seem to be happening to contemp orary concepts  of chance and determinism. To begin with, they are becoming  more complex. As Edgar Morin, a leading French sociologist­ turned-epistemologist, has written:  "Let us not forget that the problem of determinism has  changed over the course of a century .... In place of the idea  of sovereign, anonymous, permanent laws directing all things  in nature there has been subs tituted the idea of laws of interac­ tion .... There is more: the problem of determinism has be-</p><div id="pagenum"><p>23</p></div><p id="page">xxiii FOREWORD: SCIENCE AND CHANGE  come that of the order of the universe. Order means that there  are other things besides 'Jaws': that there are constraints, in­ variances, constancies, regularities in our universe .... In  place of the homogenizing and anonymous view of the old de­ terminism, there has been substituted a diversifying and evo­ lutive view of determinati ons."  And as the concept of determinism has grown richer, new  efforts have been made to recognize the co-presence of both  chance and necessity, not with one subordinate to the· other,  but as full partners in a universe that is simultaneously  organizing and de-organizing itself.  It is here that Prigogine and Stengers enter the arena. For they  have taken the argument a step farther. They not only demonstrate  (persuasivel y to me, though not to critics like the mathematician,  Rene Thorn) that both determinism and chance operate, they also  attempt to show how the two fit together.  Thus, according to the theory of change implied in the idea  of dissipative structures, when fluctuations force an existing  system into a far-from-equilibrium condition and threaten its  structure, it approaches a critical moment or bifurcation point.  At this point, according to the authors, it is inherently impos­ sible to determine in advance the next state of the system.  Chance nudges what remains of the system down a new path  of development. And once that path is chosen (from among  many), determinism takes over again until the next bifurcation  point is reached.  Here, in short, we see chance and necessity not as irreconcil­ able opposites, but each playing its role as a partner in destiny.  Yet another synthesis is achieved.  When we bring reversible time and irreversible time, disor­ der and order, physics and biology, chance and necessity all  into the same novel frame, and stipulate their interrelation­ ships, we have made a grand statemen t-arguable, no doubt,  but in this case both powerful and majestic.  Yet this accounts only in part for the excitement occasioned  by Order Out of Chaos. For this sweeping synthesis, as I have  suggested, has strong social and even political overtones. Just  as the Newtonian model gave rise to analogies in politics, di­ plomacy, and other spheres seemingly remote from science,  so, too, does the Prigoginian model lend itself to analogical  extension. </p><div id="pagenum"><p>24</p></div><p id="page">ORDER OUT OF CHAOS· xxfv  By offering rigorous ways of modeling qualitative change,  for example, they shed light on the concept of revolution. By  explaining how successive instabilities give rise to transforma­ tory change, they illuminate organization theory. They throw a  fresh light, as well, on certain psycholo gical processes-inno­ vation, for example, which the authors see as associated with  "nonaverage " behavior of the kind that arises under nonequi­ librium conditions.  Even more significant, perhaps, are the implications for the  study of collectiv e behavior. Prigogine and Stengers caution  against leaping to genetic or sociobiological explanations for  puzzling social behavior. Many things that are attributed to  biological pre-wiring are not produced by selfish, determinist  genes, but rather by social interactions under nonequilibrium  conditions.  (In one recent study, for instance, ants were divided into  two categories: One consisted of hard workers, the other of  inactive or "lazy" ants. One might overhastily trace such  traits to genetic pr edisposition. Yet the study found that if the  system were shattered by separating the two groups from one  another, each in turn developed its own subgroups of hard  workers and idlers. A significant percenta ge of the "lazy" ants  suddenly turned into hardworking Stakhano vites.)  Not surprisingly , therefore, the ideas behind this remarkable  book are beginning to be researched in economics, urban  studies, human geography , ecology, and many other disci­ plines.  No one-not even its authors-can appreciate the full im­ plications of a work as crowded with ideas as Order Out of  Chaos. Each reader will no doubt come away puzzled by some  passages (a few are simply too technical for the reader without  scientific training); startled or stimulated by others (as their  implications strike home); occasional ly skeptical ; yet intellec­ tually enriched by the whole. And if one measure of a book is  the degree to which it generates good questions, this one is  surely successful.  Here are just a couple that have haunted me.  How, outside a laboratory, might one define a .. fluctua­ tion"? What, in Prigoginian terms, does one mean by ••cause"  or "effect"? And when the authors speak of molecules com­ municating with one another to achieve coherent, synchro-</p><div id="pagenum"><p>25</p></div><p id="page">xxv FOREWORD: SCIENCE AND CHANGE  nized change, one may assume they are not anthropomorphiz·  ing. But they raise for me a host of intriguing issues about  whether all parts of the environment are signaling all the time,  or only intermittentl y; about the indirect, second, and nth  order communic ation that takes place, permitting a molecule  or an organism to respond to signals which it cannot sense for  lack of the necessary receptors. (A signal sent by the environ­ ment that is undetectable by A may be received by B and con­ verted into a different kind of signal that A is properly  equipped to receive-so that B serves as a relay/converter,  and A responds to an environmental change that has been sig­ naled to it via second-order commun ication.)  In connection with time, what do the authors make of the  idea put forward by Harvard astronomer David Layzer, that  we might conceive of three distinct "arrows of time"-one  based on the continued expansion of the universe since the Big  Bang; one based on entropy; and one based on biological and  historical evolution?  Another question: How revolutionary was the Newtonian  revolution? Taking issue with some historians, Prigogine and  Stengers point out the continuity of Newton's ideas with al­ chemy and religious notions of even earlier vintage. Some  readers might conclude from this that the rise of Newtoni­ anism was neither abrupt nor revolutionary. Yet, to my mind,  the Newtonian breakthrough should not be seen as a linear  outgrowth of these earlier ideas. Indeed, it seems to me that  the theory of change developed in Order Out of Chaos argues  against just such a "continuist" vie w.  Even if Newtonian ism was derivative, this doesn't mean  that the intc;:rnal structure of the Newtonian world-model was  actually the same or that it stood in the same relationship to its  external environment.  The Newtonian system arose at a time when feudalism in  Western Europe was crumbling-when the social system was,  so to speak, far from equilibrium. The model of the universe  proposed by the classical scientists (even if partially deriva­ tive) was applied analogously to new fields and dissemin ated  successfully, not just because of its scientific power or "right­ ness," but also because an emergent industrial society based  on revolutionary principles provided a particularly receptive  environment for it.  As suggested earlier, machine civilization, in searching for </p><div id="pagenum"><p>26</p></div><p id="page">ORDER OUT OF CHAOS .xxvi  an explanation of itself in the cosmic order of things, seized  upon the Newtonian model and rewarded those who further  developed it. It is not only in chemical beakers that we find  auto-cata lysis, as the authors would be the first to contend.  For these reasons, it still makes sense to me to regard the  Newtonian knowledge system as, itself, a "cultural dissipative  structure" born of social fluctuation.  Ironically , as I've said, I believe their own ideas are central  to the latest revolution in science, and I cannot help but see  these ideas in relationship to the demise of the Machine Age  and the rise of what I have called a "Third Wave" civil ization.  Applying their own terminology, we might characterize to­ day's breakdown of industrial or "Second Wave" society as a  civilizational "bifurcation," and the rise of a more differenti­ ated, "Third Wave" society as a leap to a new "dissipative  structure" on a world scale. And if we accept this analogy,  might we not look upon the leap from Newtonianism to Pri­ goginianism in the same way? Mere analogy, no doubt. But  illuminating, nevertheless.  Finally, we come once more to the ever-challenging issue of  chance and necessity . For if Prigogine and Stengers are right  and chance plays its role at or near the point of bifurcation,  after which deterministic proc esses take over once more until  the next bifurcation, are they not embedding chance, itself,  within a deterministic framework? By assigning a particular  role to chance, don't they de-chance it?  This question, however, I had the pleasure of discussing  with Prigogine, who smiled over dinner and replied, "Yes.  That would be true. But, of course, we can never determine  when the next bifurcation will arise." Chance rises phoenix­ like once more.  Order out of Chaos is a brilliant, demanding, dazzling book­ challenging for all and richly rewarding for the attentive reader. It  is a book to study, to savor, to reread-and to question yet again. It  places science and humanity back in a world in which ceteris  paribus is a myth-a world in which other things are seldom held  steady, equal, or unchanging. In short, it projects science into  today's revolutionary world of instability, disequilibrium, and tur­ bulence. In so doing, it serves the highest creative function-it  helps us create fresh order. </p><div id="pagenum"><p>27</p></div><p id="page">PREFACE  MAN'S NEW DIALOGUE  WITH NATURE  Our vision of nature is undergoing a radical change toward the  multiple, the temporal, and the complex. For a long time a  mechanistic world view dominated Western science. In this  view the world appeared as a vast automato n. We now under­ stand that we live in a pluralistic world. It is true that there are  phenomena that appear to us as deterministic and reversible,  such as the motion of a frictionless pendulum or the motion of  the earth around the sun. Reversible processes do not know  any privileged direction of time. But there are also irreversible  processes that involve an arrow of time. If you bring together  two liquids such as water and alcoh ol, they tend to mix in the  forward direction of time as we experience it. We never ob­ serve the reverse process, the spontaneous separation of the  mixture into pure water and pure alcohol. This is therefore an  irreversible process. All of chemistry involves such irrevers­ ible processes.  Obviously , in addition to deterministic processes, there  must be an element of probability involved in some basic pro­ cesses, such as, for example, biological evolution or the evolu­ tion of human cultures. Even the scientist who is convinced of  the validity of deterministic descriptions would probably hesi­ tate to imply that at the very moment of the Big Bang, the  moment of the creation of the universe as we know it, the date  of the publication of this book was already inscribed in the  laws of nature. In the classical view the basic processes of  nature were considered to be deterministic and reversible.  Processes involving randomness or irreversibility were consid­ ered only exceptions. Today we see everywhere the role of  irreversible processes, of fluctuations_  Although We stern science has stimulated an extremely fruit- xxvii </p><div id="pagenum"><p>28</p></div><p id="page">ORDER OUT OF CHAOS xxviii  ful dialogue between man and nature, some of its cultural con­ sequences have been disastrous. The dichotomy between the  "two cultures" is to a large extent due to the conflict between  the atemporal view of classical science and the time-oriented  view that prevails in a large part of the social sciences and  humanities. But in the past few decades, something very dra­ matic has been happening in science, something as unex­ pected as the birth of geometry or the grand vision of the  cosmos as expressed in Newton's work. We are becoming  more and more conscious of the fact that on all levels, from  elementary particles to cosmology, randomness and irrevers­ ibility play an ever-increasing role. Science is rediscovering  time. It is this conceptual revolution that this book sets out to  describe.  This revolution is proceeding on all levels, on the level of  elementary particles, in cosmology, and on the level of so­ called macroscopic physics, which comprises the physics and  chemistry of atoms and molecules either taken individually or  considered globally as, for example, in the study of liquids or  gases. It is perhaps particularly on this macroscopic level that  the reconceptualization of science is most easy to follow. Clas­ sical dynamics and modern chemistry are going through a pe­ riod of drastic change. If one asked a physicist a few years ago  what physics permits us to explain and which problems re­ main open, he would have answered that we obviously do not  have an adequate understanding of elementary particles or of  cosmological evolution but that our knowledge of things in be­ tween was pretty satisfactory. Today a growing minority , to  which we belong, would not share this optimism: we have only  begun to understand the level of nature on which we live, and  this is the level on which we have concentrated in this book.  To appreciate the reconceptualization of physics taking  place today, we must put it in proper historical perspective .  The history of science is far from being a linear unfolding that  corresponds to a series of successive approximations toward  some intrinsic truth. It is full of contradictions, of unexpected  turning points. We have devoted a large portion of this book to  the historical pattern followed by Western science, starting  with Newton three centuries ago. We have tried to place the  history of science in the frame of the history of ideas to inte­ grate it in the evolution of Western culture during the past </p><div id="pagenum"><p>29</p></div><p id="page">xxfx MAN'S NEW DIALOGUE WITH NATURE  three centuries. Only in this way can we appreciate the unique  moment in which we are presently living.  Our scientific heritage includes two basic questions to  which till now no answer was provided. One is the relation  between disorder and order. The famous law of increase of  entropy -describes the world as evolving from order to disor­ der; still, biological or social evolution shows us the compl�x  emerging from the simple. How is this possible? How can  structure arise from disorder? Great progress has been real­ ized in this question. We know now that nonequilib rium, the  flow of matter and energy, may be a source of order.  But there is the second question, even more basic: classical  or quantum physics describes the world as reversible, as  static. In this description there is no evolution, neither to  order nor to disorder; the "information," as may be defined  from dynamics, remains constant in time. Therefore there is  an obvious contradiction between the static view of dynamics  and the evolutionary paradigm of thermodynamics. What is  irreversibility? What is entropy? Few questions have been dis­ cussed more often in the course of the history of science. We  begin to be able to give some answers. Order and disorder are  complicated notions: the units involved in the static descrip­ tion of dynamics are not the same as those that have to be  introduced to achieve the evolutionary paradigm as expressed  by the growth of entropy. This transition leads to a new con­ cept of matter, matter that is "active," as matter leads to irre­ versible processes and as irreversible processes organize  matter.  The evolutionary paradigm, including the concept of en­ tropy, has exerted a considerable fascination that goes far  beyond science proper. We hope that our unification of dynam­ ics and thermodynamics will bring out clearly the radical nov­ elty of the entropy concept in respect to the mechanistic world  view. Time and reality are closely related. For humans, reality  is embedded in the flow of time. As we shall see, the irrevers­ ibility of time is itself closely connected to entropy. To make  time flow backw ard we would have to overcome an infinite  entropy barrier.  Traditionally science has dealt with universals, humanities  with particulars. The convergence of science and humanities  was emphasized in the French title of our book, La Nouvelle </p><div id="pagenum"><p>30</p></div><p id="page">ORDER OUT OF CHAOS xxx  Alliance, published by Gallimard, Paris, in 1979. However , we  have not succeeded in finding a proper English equivalent of  this title. Furthermore, the text we present here differs from  the French edition, especially in Chapters VII through IX. Al­ though the origin of structures as the result of nonequilibrium  processes was already adequately treated in the French edi­ tion (as well as in the translations that followed), we had to  entirely rewrite the third part, which deals with our new re­ sults concerning the roots of time as well as with the formula­ tion of the evolutionary paradigm in the frame of the physical  sciences.  This is all quite recent. The reconceptualiz ation of physics  is far from being achieved. We have decided, however, to pre­ sent the situation as it seems to us today. We have a feeling of  great intellectual excitement : we begin to have a glimpse of the  road that leads from being to becoming. As one of us has de­ voted most of his scientific lif e to this problem, he may per­ haps be excused for expressing his feeling of satisfaction, of  aesthetic achievement, which he hopes the reader will share.  For too long there appeared a conflict between what seemed  to be eternal, to be out of time, and what was in time. We see  now that there is a more subtle form of reality involving both  time and eternity.  This book is the outcome of a collective effort in which  many colleagues and friends have been involved. We cannot  thank them all individually. We would like, however, to single  out what we owe to Erich Jantsch, Aharon Katchalsky, Pierre  Resibois, and Leon Rosenfeld, who unfortunately are no  longer with us. We have chosen to dedicate this book to their  memory.  We want also to acknowledge the continuous support we  have received from the Instituts Internationaux de Physique et  de Chimie, founded by E. Solvay, and from the Robert A.  Welch Foundation.  The human race is in a period of transition. Science is likely  to play an important role at this moment of demographic ex­ plosion. It is therefore more important than ever to keep open  the channels of communication between science and society.  The present development of Western science has taken it out­ side the cultural environment of the seventeen th centu.ry, in  which it was born. We believe that science today carries a uni-</p><div id="pagenum"><p>31</p></div><p id="page">xxxi MAN'S NEW DIALOGUE WITH NATURE  versal message that is more acceptable to different cultural  traditions.  During the past decades Alvin Toffier's books have been im­ portant in bringing to the attention of the public some features  of the "Third Wave" that character izes our time. We are there­ fore grateful to him for having written the Foreword to the  English-la nguage version of our book. English is not our na­ tive language. We believe that to some extent every language  provides a different way of describing the common reality in  which we are embedded. Some of these character istics will  survive even the most careful translation. In any case, we are  most grateful to Joseph Early, Ian MacGilvray, Carol  Thurston, and especially to Carl Rubino for their help in the  preparation of this English-language version. We would also  like to express our deep thanks to Pamela Pape for the careful  typing of the successiv e versions of the manuscr ipt. </p><div id="pagenum"><p>32</p></div><p id="page"></p><div id="pagenum"><p>33</p></div><p id="page">INTRODUCTION  THE CHALLENGE TO  SCIENCE  1  It is hardly an exaggera tion to state that one of the greatest  dates in the history of mankind was April28, 1686, when New­ ton presented his Principia to the Royal Society of London. It  contained the basic laws of motion together with a clear for­ mulation of some of the fundamental concepts we still use to­ day, such as mass, accelera tion, and inertia. The greatest  impact was probably made by Book III of the Principia, titled  The System of the World, which included the universal law of  gravitation. Newton's contemporaries immediately grasped  the unique importance of his work. Gravitation became a topic  of conversation both in London and Paris.  Three centuries have now elapsed since Newton's Principia.  Science has grown at an incredible speed, permeating the life  of all of us. Our scientific horizon has expanded to truly fan­ tastic proportions. On the microscopic scale, elementary par­ tide physics studies processes involving physical dimensions  of the order of w-ts em and times of the order of I0-22 sec­ ond. On the other hand, cosmology leads us to times of the  order of 1010 years, the "age of the universe." Science and  technology are closer than ever. Among other factors, new  biotechnologies and the progress in information techniques  promise to change our lives in a radical way.  Running parallel to this quantitative growth are deep quali­ tative changes whose repercussions reach far beyond science  proper and affect the very image of nature. The great founders  of Western science stressed the universality and the eternal  character of natural laws. They set out to formulate general  schemes that would coincide with the very ideal of rationality . </p><div id="pagenum"><p>34</p></div><p id="page">ORDER OUT OF CHAOS 2  As Roger Hausheer says in his fine introduction to Isaiah  Berlin's Against the Current, "They sought all-embr acing  schemas, universal unifying frameworks, within which every­ thing that exists could be shown to be systematically -i.e.,  logically or causally-interconne cted, vast structures in which  there should be no gaps left open for spontaneou s, unattended  developm ents, where everything that occurs should be, at  least in principle, wholly explicable in terms of immutable  general laws." t  The story of this quest is indeed a dramatic one. There were  moments when this ambitious program seemed near comple­ tion. A fundamental level from which all other properties of  matter could be deduced seemed to be in sight. Such moments  can be associa ted with the formulation of Bohr's celebrated  atomic model, which reduced matter to simple planetary sys­ tems formed by electrons and protons. Another moment of  great suspense came when Einstein hoped to condense all the  laws of physics into a single "unified field theory." Great prog­ ress has indeed been realized in the unification of some of the  basic forces found in nature. Still, the fundamental level re­ mains elusive. Wherever we look we find evolution, diver­ sification, and instabilities. Curiously , this is true on all levels,  in the field of elementary particles, in biology, and in astro­ physics, with the expanding universe and the formation of  black holes.  As we said in the Preface, our vision of nature is undergoing  a radical change toward the multiple, the temporal, and the  complex . Curiously , the unexpected complexity that has been  discovered in nature has not led to a slowdown in the progress  of science, but on the contrary to the emergence of new con­ ceptual structures that now appear as essential to our under­ standing of the physical world-the world that includes us. It  is this new situation, which has no precedent in the history of  science, that we wish to analyze in this book.  The story of the transformation of our conceptions about  science and nature can hardly be separated from another  story, that of the feelings aroused by science. With every new  intellectual program always come new hopes, fears, and ex­ pectations. In classical science the emphasis was on time-in­ dependent laws. As we shall see, once the particular state of a  system has been measured, the reversible laws of classical sci-</p><div id="pagenum"><p>35</p></div><p id="page">3 THE CHALLENGE TO SCIENCE  ence are supposed to determine its future, just as they had  determined its past. It is natural that this quest for an eternal  truth behind changing phenomena aroused enthusiasm. But it  also came as a shock that nature described in this way was in  fact debased: by the very success of science, nature was  shown to be an automato n, a robot.  The urge to reduce the diversity of nature to a web of illu­ sions has been present in Western thought since the time of  Greek atomists. Lucretius, following his masters Democritus  and Epicurus, writes that the world is "just" atoms and void  and urges us to look for the hidden behind the obvious: "Still,  lest you happen to mistrust my words, because the eye cannot  perceive prime bodies, hear now of particles you must admit  exist in the world and yet cannot be seen. "2  Yet it is well known that the driving force behind the work of  the Greek atomists was not to debase nature but to free men  from fear, the fear of any supernatur al being, of any order that  would transcend that of men and nature. Again and again Lu­ cretius repeats that we have nothing to fear, that the essence of  the world is the ever-changing associations of atoms in the  void.  Modern science transmuted this fundamentally ethical  stance into what seemed to be an established truth; and this  truth, the reduction of nature to atoms and void, in turn gave  rise to what Lenoble3 has called the "anxiety of modern  men." How can we recognize ourselves in the random world  of the atoms? Must science be defined in terms of rupture be­ tween man and nature? '�JI bodies, the firmament, the stars,  the earth and its kingdoms are not equal to the lowest mind;  for mind knows all this in itself and these bodies nothing. "4  This "Pensee" by Pascal expresses the same feeling of alien­ ation we find among contempo rary scientists such as Jacques  Monod:  Man must at last finally awake from his millenary  dream; and in doing so, awake to his total solitude, his  fundamental isolation. Now does he at last realize that,  like a gypsy, he lives on the boundary of an alien world. A  world that is deaf to his music. just as indifferent to his  hopes as it is to his suffering or his crimes.s </p><div id="pagenum"><p>36</p></div><p id="page">ORDER OUT OF CHAOS 4  This is a paradox. A brilliant breakthrough in molecular bi­ ology, the decipher ing of the genetic code, in which Monod  actively participat ed, ends upon a tragic note. This very prog­ ress, we are told, makes us the gypsies ,0f the universe. How  can we explain this situation? Is not science a way of com­ munication, a dialogue with nature?  In the past, strong distinctions were frequently made be­ tween man's world and the supposedly alien natural world. A  famous passage by Vico in The New Science describes this  most vividly:  ... in the night of thick darkness enveloping the earliest  antiquity , so remote from ourselves, there shines the eter­ nal and never failing light of a truth beyond all question:  that the world of civil society has certainly been made by  men, and that its principles are therefore to be found  within the modifica tions of our own human mind.  Whoever reflects on this cannot but marvel that the phi­ losophers should have bent all their energies to the study  of the world of nature, which, since God made it, He  alone knows; and that they should have neglected the  study of the world of nations, or civil world, which, since  men had made it, men could come to know. 6  Present -day research leads us farther and farther away from  the opposition between man and the natural world. It will be  one of the main purposes of this book to show, instead of rup­ ture and opposition, the growing coherence of our knowledge  of man and nature.  In the past, the questioning of nature has taken the most di­ verse forms. Sumer discovered writing; the Sumerian priests  speculated that the future might be written in some hidden  way in the events taking place around us in the present. They  even systematized this belief, mixing magical and rational ele­ ments. 7 In this sense we may say that Western science, which  originated in the seventeenth century, only opened a new  chapter in the everlasting dialogue between man and nature. </p><div id="pagenum"><p>37</p></div><p id="page">5 THE CHALLENGE TO SCIENCI:  Alexandre Koyres has defined the innovation brought about  by modern science in terms of "experimentatio n." Modern  science is based on the discovery of a new and specific form of  communica tion with nature-that is, on the conviction that  nature responds to experimental interrogation. How can we  define more precisely the experime ntal dialogue? Experimen­ tation does not mean merely the faithful observation of facts  as they occur, nor the mere search for empirical connections  between phenomena, but presupposes a systematic interac­ tion between theoretical concepts and observation.  In hundreds of different ways scientists have expressed ttieir  amazement when, on determining the right question, they dis­ cover that they can see how the puzzle fits together. In this  sense, science is like a two-partner game ir;t which we have to  guess the behavior of a reality unrelated to our beliefs, our  ambitions, or our hopes. Nature cannot be forced to say any­ thing we want it to. Scientific investigation is not a mono­ logue. It is precisely the risk involved that makes this game  exciting.  But the uniqueness of Western science is far from being ex­ hausted by such methodological considerations. When Karl  Popper discussed the normative description of scientific ra­ tionality, he was forced to admit that in the final analysis ra­ tional science owes its existence to its success; the scientific  method is applicable only by virtue of the astonishing points  of agreement between preconceived models and experimental  results.9 Science is a risky game, but it seems to have dis­ covered questions to which nature provides consistent an­ swers.  The success of Western science is an histor ical fact, unpre­ dictable a priori, but which cannot be ignored. The surprising  success of modern science has led to an irreversible transfor­ mation of our relations with nature. In this sense, the term  "scientific revolution" can legitimately be used. The history of  mankind has been marked by other turning points, by other  singular conjunctions of circumstances leading to irreversible  changes. One such crucial event is known as the "Neolithic  revolution." But there, just as in the case of the "choices"  marking biological evolution, we can at present only proceed  by guesswork, while there is a wealth of information concern­ ing decisive episodes in the evolution of science. The so-called </p><div id="pagenum"><p>38</p></div><p id="page">ORDER OUT OF CHAOS 6  "Neolithic revolution" took thousands of years. Simplifying  somewhat , we may say the scientific revolution started only  three ·Centuries ago. We have what is perhaps a unique oppor­ tunity to apprehend the specific and intelligible mixture of  "chance" and "necessity" marking this revolution.  Science init iated a successful dialogue with nature. On the  other hand, the first outcome of this dialogue was the discov­ ery of a silent world. This is the paradox of classical science.  It revealed to men a dead, passive nature, a nature that be­ haves as an automaton which, once programmed, continues to  follow the rules inscribed in the program. In this sense the  dialogue with nature isolated man from nature instead of  bringing him closer to it. A triumph of human reason turned  into a sad truth. It seemed that science debased everything it  touched.  Modern science horrified both its opponents, for whom it  appeared as a deadly danger, and some of its supporters , who  saw in man's solitude as "discovered" by science the price we  had to pay for this new rationality.  The cultural tension associated with classical science can be  held at least partly responsible for the unstable position of sci­ ence within society; it led to an heroic assumption of the harsh  implications of rationality, but it led also to violent rejection.  We shall return later to present-da y antiscience movements.  Let us take an earlier example-the irrationalist movement in  Germany in the 1920s that formed the cultural background to  quantum mechanics. to In oppositio n to science, which was  identified with a set of concepts such as causality , determi­ nism, reductioni sm, and rationality , there was a violent up­ surge of ideas denied by science but seen as the embodiment  of the fundamental irrationality of nature. Life, destiny, free­ dom, and spontaneity thus became manifestations of a shad­ owy underworld impenetrable to reason. Without going into  the peculiar sociopolitical context to which it owed its vehe­ ment nature, we can state that this rejection illustrates the  risks associated with classical science. By admitting only a  subjective meaning for a set of experiences men believe to be  significant, science runs the risk of transferring these into the  realm of the irrational, bestowing upon them a formidable  power.  As Joseph Needham has emphasized, Western thought has </p><div id="pagenum"><p>39</p></div><p id="page">7 THE CHALLENGE TO SCIENCE  always oscillated between the world as an automaton and a  theology in which God governs the universe. This is what  Needham calls the "characteristic European schizo­ phrenia. "II In fact, these visions are connected. An automa­ ton needs an external god.  Do we really have to make this tragic choice? Must we  choose between a science that leads to alienation and an anti­ scientific metaphysical view of nature? We think such a choice  is no longer necessary, since the changes that science is under­ going today lead to a radically new situation . This recent evo­ lution of science gives us a unique opportunity to reconsider  its position in culture in general. Modern science originated in  the specific context of the European seventeenth century. We  are now approaching the end of the twentieth century, and it  seems that some more universal message is carried by sci­ ence, a message that concerns the interaction of man and na­ ture as well as of man with man.  What are the assumptions of classical science from which we  believe science has freed itself today? Gene rally those center­ ing around the basic conviction that at some level the world is  simple and is governed by time-reversible fundamental laws.  Today this appears as an excessive simplification. We may  compare it to reducing buildings to piles of bricks. Yet out of  the same bricks we may construct a factory, a palace, or a  cathedral. It is on the level of the building as a whole that we  apprehend it as a creature of time, as a product of a culture, a  society, a style. But there is the additional and obvious prob­ lem that, since there is no one to build nature, we must give to  its very "bricks"-that is, to its microscopic activity-a de­ scription that accounts for this building process.  The quest of classical science is in itself an illustration of a  dichotomy that runs throughout the history of Western  thought. Only the immutable world of ideas was traditionally  recognized as "illuminated by the sun of the intelligible," to  use Plato's expression. In the same sense, only eternal laws  were seen to express scientific rationality. Temporality was  looked down upon as an illusion. This is no longer true today. </p><div id="pagenum"><p>40</p></div><p id="page">ORDER OUT OF CHAOS 8  We have discovered that far from being an illusion, irrevers·  ibility plays an essential role in nature and lies at the origin of  most processes of self-organization. We find ourselves in a  world in which reversibility and determinism apply only to  limiting, simple cases, while irreversibility and randomness  are the rules. .  The denial of time and complexity was central to the cultur al  issues raised by the scientific enterprise in its classical defini­ tion. The challenge of these concepts was also deci sive for the  metamor phosis of science we wish to describe. In his great  book The Nature of the Physical World, Arthur Eddingtonl2  introduced a distinction between primary and secondary laws.  "Primary laws" control the behavior of single particles, while  "secondary laws" are applicable to collections of atoms or  molecules. To insist on secondary laws is to emphasize that  the description of elementary behaviors is not sufficient for  understanding a system as a whole. An outstanding case of a  secondary law is, in Eddington's view, the second law of ther­ modynamics, the law that introduces the "arrow of time" in  physics. Eddington writes: "From the point of view of phi­ losophy of science the conception associated with entropy  must, I think, be ranked as the great contribution of the nine­ teenth century to scientific thought. It marked a reaction from  the view that everything to which science need pay attention is  discovered by a microscopic dissection of objects." 13 This  trend has been dramatically amplified today.  It is true that some of the greatest successes of modern sci­ ence are discoveries at the microscopic level, that of mole­ cules, atoms, or elementary particles. For example, molecular  biology has been immensely successful in isolating speci fic  molecules that play a central role in the mechanism of life. In  fact, this success has been so overwhelming that for many sci­ entists the aim of research is identified with this "microscopic  dissection of objects," to use Eddington's expression. How­ ever, the second law of thermodynamics presented the first  challenge to a concept of nature that would explain away the  complex and reduce it to the simplicity of some hidden world.  Today interest is shifting from substance to relation, to com­ munication, to time.  This change of perspective is not the result of some arbi­ trary decision. In physics it was forced upon us by new dis-</p><div id="pagenum"><p>41</p></div><p id="page">9 THE CHALLENGE TO SCIENCE  coveries no one could have foreseen. Who would have  expected that most (and perhaps all) elementary particles  would prove to be unstable? Who would have expected that  with the experimental confirmation of an expanding universe  we could conceive of the history of the world as a whole?  At the end of the twentieth century we have learned to un­ derstand better the meaning of the two great revolutions that  gave shape to the physics of our time, quantum mechanics and  relativity. They started as attempts to correct classical me­ chanics and to incorporate into it the newly found universal  constants. Today the situation has changed. Quantum me­ chanics has given us the theoretical frame to describe the in­ cessant transformations of particles into each other. Similarly,  general relativity has become the basic theory in terms of  which we can describe the thermal history of our universe in  its early stages.  Our universe has a pluralistic, complex character . Struc­ tures may disappear, but also they may appear. Some pro­ cesses are, as far as we know, well described by deterministic  equations, but others involve probabilistic processes.  How then can we overcome the apparent contradiction be­ tween these concepts? We are living in a single universe. As  we shall see, we are beginning to appreciate the meaning of  these probl ems. Moreover , the importance we now give to the  various phenomena we observe and describe is quite different  from, even opposite to, what was suggested by classical physics.  There the basic processes, as we mentioned , are considered as  deterministic and reversible. Processes involving randomness  or irreversibility are considered to be exception s. Today we  see everywhere the role of irreversible processes, of fluctua­ tions. The models considered by classical physics seem to us  to occur only in limiting situations such as we can create ar­ tificially by putting matter into a box and then waiting till it  reaches equilibrium.  The artificial may be deterministic and reversible. The natu­ ral contains essential elements of randomness and irrevers­ ibility. This leads to a new view of matter in which matter is no  longer the passive substance described in the mechanistic  world view but is associated with spontaneous activity. This  change is so profound that, as we stated in our Preface, we can  really speak about a new dialogue of man with nature. </p><div id="pagenum"><p>42</p></div><p id="page">ORDER OUT OF CHAOS 10  This book deals with the conceptual transformation of sci­ ence from the Golden Age of classical science to the present.  To describe this transformation we could have chosen many  roads. We could have studied the problems of elementary par­ ticles. We could have followed recent fascinating develop­ ments in astrophysics. These are the subjects that seem to  delimit the frontiers of science. However, as we stated in our  Preface, over the past years so many new fea�ures of nature at  our level have been discovered that we decided to concentrate  on this intermediate level, on problems that belong mainly to  our macroscopic world, which includes atoms, molecule s, and  especially biomolecules. Still it is important to emphasize that  the evolution of science proceeds on somewhat parallel lines at  every level, be it that of elementary particles, chemistry, biol­ ogy, or cosmology. On every scale self-organization, complex­ ity, and time play a new and unexpected role.  Therefore, our aim is to examine the significance of three  centuries of scientific progress from a definite viewpoint.  There is certainly a subjective element in the way we have  chosen our material. The problem of time is really the center  of the research that one of us has been pursuing all his life.  When as a young student at the University of Brussels he  came into contact with physics and chemistry for the first  time, he was astonished that science had so little to say about  time, especially since his earlier education had centered  mainly around history and archaeology. This surprise could  have led him to two attitudes, both of which we find ex­ emplified in the past: one would have been to discard the prob­ lem, since class ical science seemed to have no place for time;  and the other would have been to look for some other way of  apprehending nature, in which time would play a different,  more basic role. This is the path Bergson and Whitehead, to  mention only two philosophers. of our century, chose. The first  position would be a "positivistic" one, the second a "meta­ physical" one.  There was, however, a third path, which was to ask whether  the simplicity of the temporal evolution traditionally consid-</p><div id="pagenum"><p>43</p></div><p id="page">11 THE CHALLENGE TO SCIENCE  ered in physics and chemistry was due to the fact that atten­ tion was paid mainly to some very simplified situations, to  heaps of bricks in contrast with the cathedral to which we have  alluded.  This book is divided into three parts. The first part deals  with the triumph of classical science and the cultural con­ sequences of this triumph. Initially, science was greeted with  enthusias m. We shall then describe the cultural polarization  that occurred as a result of the existence of classical science  and its astonishing success. Is this success to be accepted as  such, perhaps limiting its implications, or must the scientific  method itself be rejected as partial or illusory? Both choices  lead to the same result-the collision between what has often  been called the "two cultures," science and the humanities.  These questions have played a basic role in Western thought  since the formulation of classical science. Again and again we  come to the problem, "How to choose?" Isaiah Berlin has  rightly seen in this question the beginning of the schism be­ tween the sciences and the humanities:  The specific and unique versus the repetitive and the uni­ versal, the concrete versus the abstract, perpetual move­ ment versus rest, the inner versus the outer, quality  versus quantity, culture-bound versus timeless principles,  mental strife and self-transformation as a permanent con­ dition of man versus the possibility (and desirability) of  peace, order, final harmony and the satisfaction of all ra- -tional human wishes-these are some of the aspects of  the contr ast.14  We have devoted much space to classical mechanics. In­ deed, in our view this is the best vantage point from which we  may contempla te the present-day transformation of science.  Classical dynamics seems to express in an especially clear and  striking way the static view of nature. Here time apparently is  reduced to a parameter, and future and past become equiv­ alent. It is true that quantum theory has raised many new  problems not covered by classical dynamics but it has never­ theless retained a number of the conceptual positions of classi­ cal dynamic s, particularl y as far as time and process are  concerned. </p><div id="pagenum"><p>44</p></div><p id="page">ORDER OUT OF CHAOS 12  As early as at the beginning of the nineteenth century,  precisely when classical science was triumphant, when the  Newtonian program dominated French science and the latter  dominated Europe, the first threat to the Newtonian con­ struction loomed into sight. In the second part of our study we  shall follow the development of the science of heat, this rival to  Newton's science of gravity, starting fro m the first gauntlet  thrown down when Fourier formulated the law governing the  propagat ion of heat. It was, in fact, the first quantitative de­ scription of something inconceivable in classical dynamics­ an irreversible process.  The two descendants of the science of heat, the science of  energy conversion and the science of heat engines, gave birth  to the first "nonclassical" science-thermod ynamics. The  most original contribution of thermod ynamics is the cele­ brated second law, which introduced into physics the arrow of  time. This introduction was part of a more global intellectual  move. The nineteenth century was really the century of evolu­ tion; biology, geology, and sociology emphasized processes of  becoming, of increasing complexity . As for thermodynamic s,  it is based on the distinction of two types of processes: revers­ ible processes, which are independent of the direction of time,  and irreversible processes, which depend on the direction of  time. We shall see examples later. It was in order to distinguish  the two types of processes that the concept of entropy was  introduced, since entropy increases only because of the irre­ versible processes.  During the nineteenth century the final state of thermody­ namic evolution was at the center of scientific research. This  was equilibrium thermod ynamics. Irreversible processes were  looked down on as nuisances, as disturban ces, as subjects not  worthy of study. Today this situation has completely changed.  We now know that far from equilibrium, new types of struc­ tures may originate spontaneo usly. In far-from-equilibrium  conditions we may have transformation from disorder, from  thermal chaos, into order. New dynamic states of matter may  originate, states that reflect the interaction of a given system  with its surroundings. We have called these new structures dis­ sipative structures to emphasize the constructive role of dis­ sipative processes in their formation.  This book describes some of the methods that have been </p><div id="pagenum"><p>45</p></div><p id="page">13 THE CHALLENGE TO SCIENCE  developed in recent years to deal with the appearance and evo­ lution of dissipative structures. Here we find the key words  that run throughout this book like leitmotivs: nonlinearity, in­ stability, fluctuations. They have begun to permeate our view  of nature even beyond the fields of physics and chemistry  proper.  We cited Isaiah Berlin when we discussed the opposition be­ tween the sciences and the humanities. He opposed the specific  and unique to the repetitive and the universal. The remarkable  feature is that when we move from equilibrium to far-from­ equilibrium conditions, we move away from the repetitive and  the universal to the specific and the unique. Indeed, the laws  of equilibrium are universal. Matter near equilibrium behaves  in a "repetitive" way. On the other hand, far from equilibrium  there appears a variety of mechanisms corresponding to the  possibility of occurrence of various types of dissipative struc­ tures. For example, far from equilibrium we may witness the  appearance of chemical clocks, chemical reactions which be­ have in a coherent, rhythmical fashion. We may also have pro­ cesses of self-organization leading to nonhomogeneous  structures to nonequilibrium crystals.  We would like to emphasize the unexpected character of this  behavior . Every one of us has an intuitive view of how a chemi­ cal reaction takes place; we imagine molecules floating  through space, colliding, and reappeari ng in new forms. We  see chaotic behavior similar to what the atomists described  when they spoke about dust dancing in the air. But in a chemi­ cal clock the behavior is quite different. Oversimplif ying some­ what, we can say that in a chemical clock all molecules change  their chemical identity simultaneously, at regular time inter­ vals. If the molecules can be imagined as blue or red, we  would see their change of color following the rhythm of the  chemical clock reaction.  Obviously such a situation can no longer be described in  terms of chaotic behavior. A new type of order has appeared .  We can speak of a new coherence, of a mechanism of "com­ munication" among molecules. But this type of communic a­ tion can arise only in far-from-equilibrium conditions. It is  quite interesting that such communic ation seems to be the rule  in the world of biology. It may in fact be taken as the very basis  of the definition of a biological system. </p><div id="pagenum"><p>46</p></div><p id="page">ORDER OUT OF CHAOS 14  In addition, the type of dissipative structure depends crit­ ically on the conditions in which the structure is formed. Ex­ ternal fields such as the gravitational field of earth, as well as  the magnetic field, may play an essential role in the selection  mechanism of self-organization.  We begin to see how, starting from chemistry, we may build  complex structures, complex forms, some of which may have  been the precursors of life. What seems certain is that these  far-from-equilibrium phenomena illustrate an essential and un­ expected property of matter: physics may henceforth describe  structures as adapted to outside conditions. We meet in rather  simple chemical systems a kind of prebiological adaptation  mechanism. To use somewhat anthropomorphic language : in  equilibrium matter is "blind," but in far-from-equilibrium con­ ditions it begins to be able to perceive , to "take into account ,"  in its way of functioning , differences in the external world  (such as weak gravitational or electrical fields).  Of course, the problem of the origin of life remains a diffi­ cult one, and we do not think a simple solution is imminent.  Still, from this perspective life no longer appears to oppose the  "normal" laws of physics, struggling against them to avoid its  normal fate-its destruction. On the contrary, life seems to  express in a specific way the very conditions in which our bio­ sphere is embedded, incorporating the nonlinearities of chemi­ cal reactions and the far-from-equilibrium conditions imposed  on the biosphere by solar radiation.  We have discussed the concepts that allow us to describe the  formation of dissipative structur es, such as the theory of bifur­ cations. It is remarkable that near-bifurcations systems pre­ sent large fluctuations. Such systems seem to "hesitate"  among various possible directions of evolution, and the fa­ mous law of large numbers in its usual sense breaks down. A  small fluctuation may start an entirely new evolution that will  drastically change the whole behavior of the macroscopic sys­ tem. The analogy with social phenomena, even with history, is  inescapa ble. Far from opposing "chance" and "necessity," we  now see both aspects as essential in the description of non­ linear systems far from equilibrium.  The first two parts of this book thus deal with two conflict­ ing views of the physical universe: the static view of classical  dynamic s, and the evolutionary view associated with entropy. </p><div id="pagenum"><p>47</p></div><p id="page">15 THE CHALLENGE TO SCIENCE  A confrontation between these views has become unavoid­ able. For a long time this confrontation was postponed by con­ sidering irreversibility as an illusion, as an approximat ion; it  was man who introduced time into a timeless universe. How­ ever, this solution in which irreversibility is reduced to an illu­ sion or to approximations can no longer be accepted, since we  know that irreversibility may be a source of order, of co­ herence, of organization.  We can no longer avoid this confrontation. It is the subject  of the third part of this book. We describe traditional attempts  to approach the problem of irreversibility first in classical and  then in quantum mechani cs. Pioneering work was done here,  especially by Boltzmann and Gibbs. However , we can state  that the problem was left largely unsolved. As Karl Popper  relates it, it is a dramatic story: first, Boltzmann thought he  had given an objective formulation to the new concept of time  implied in the second law. But as a result of his controversy  with Zermelo and others, he had to retreat.  In the light of history-or in the darkness of history­ Boltzmann was defeated, according to all accepted stan­ dards, though everybody accepts his eminence as a phys­ icist. For he never succeeded in clearing up the status of  his Ji-theorem; nor did he explain entropy increase ... .  Such was the pressur e that he lost faith in himself .. .. 15  The problem of irreversibility still remains a subject of lively  controve rsy. How is this possible one hundred fifty years after  the discovery of the second law of thermodynam ics? There are  many aspects to this question, some cultural and some techni­ cal. There is a cultural component in the mistrust of time. We  shall on several occasions cite the opinion of Einstein. His  judgment sounds final: time (as irreversibility) is an illusion. In  fact, Einstein was reiterating what Giordano Bruno had writ­ ten in the sixteenth century and what had become for cen­ turies the credo of science: "The universe is, therefore, one,  infinite, immobile .... It does not move itself locally .... It  does not generate itself .... It is not corruptible .... It is not  alterable ... . "16 For a long time Bruno's vision dominated  the scientific view of the Western world. It is therefore not  surprising that the intrusion of irreversibility , coming mainly </p><div id="pagenum"><p>48</p></div><p id="page">ORDER OUT OF CHAOS 16  from the engineering sciences and physical chemistry, was re·  ceived with mistrust. But there are technical reasons in addi·  tion to cultural ones. Every attempt to "derive" irreversibility  from dynamics necessarily had to fail, because irreversibility  is not a universal phenomenon. We can imagine situations that  are strictly reversible, such as a pendulum in the absence of  friction, or planetary motion. This failure has led to dis·  couragement and to the feeling that, in the end, the whole con­ cept of irreversibility has a subjective origin. We shall discuss  all these problems at some length. Let us say here that today  we can see this problem from a different point of view, since  we now know that there are different classes of dynamic sys­ tems. The world is far from being homogeneous. Therefore the  question can be put in different terms: What is the specific  structure of dynamic systems that permits them to "dis­ tinguish" past and future? What is the minimum complexity  involved?  Progress has been realized along these lines. We can now be  more precise about the roots of time in nature. This has far­ reaching consequences. The second law of thermodynam ics,  the law of entropy, introduced irreversibility into the mac­ roscopic world. We now can understand its meaning on the  microscopic level as well. As we shall see, the second law cor­ responds to a selection rule, to a restriction on initial condi­ tions that is then propagated by the laws of dynamics.  Therefore the second law introduces a new irreducible ele­ ment into our description of nature. While it is consistent with  dynamics, it cannot be derived from dynamics.  Boltzmann already understood that probability and irrevers­ ibility had to be closely related. Only when a system behaves  in a sufficiently random way may the difference between past  and future, and therefore irreversibility, enter into its descrip:­ tion. Our analysis confirms this point of view. Indeed, what is  the meaning of an arrow of time in a deterministic description  of nature? If the future is already in some way contained in the  present, which also contains the past, what is the meaning of  an arrow of time? The arrow of time� a manifestation of the  fact that the future is not given, that, as the French poet Paul  Valery emphasized , "time is constructi on." 17  The experience of our everyday life manifests a radical dif­ ference between time and space. We can move from one point </p><div id="pagenum"><p>49</p></div><p id="page">17 THE CHALLENGE TO SCIENCE  of space to anot her. However , we cannot turn time around. We  cannot exchange past and future. As we shall see, this feeling  of impossibility is now acquiring a precise scientific meaning.  Permitted states are separated from states that are prohibited  by the second law of thermodynamics by means of an infinite  entropy barrier. There are other barriers in physics. One is the  velocity of light, which in our present view limits the speed at  which signals may be transmitted. It is essential that this bar­ rier exist; if not, causality would fall to pieces. Similarly, the  entropy barrier is the prerequisite for giving a meaning tQ com­ munication. Imagine what would happen if our future would  become the past for other people! We shall return to this later.  The recent evolution of physics has emphasized the reality  of time. In the process new aspects of time have been un­ covered. A preoccupation with time runs all through our cen­ tury. Think of Einstein, Proust, Freud, Teilhard, Peirce, or  Whitehead.  One of the most surprising results of Einstein's special the­ ory of relativity, published in 1905, was the introduction of a  local time associated with each observer. However, this local  time remained a reversible time. Einstein's problem both in  the special and the general theories of relativity was mainly  that of the "commu nication" between observers, the way they  could compare time intervals. But we can now investigate time  in other conceptual contexts.  In classical mechanics time was a number characterizing the  position of a point on its trajectory. But time may have a dif­ ferent meaning on a global level. When we look at a child and  guess his or her age, this age is not located in any special part  of the child's body. It is a global judgment. It has often been  stated that science spatializes time. But we now discover that  another point of view is possible. Consider a landscape and its  evolution: villages grow, bridges and roads connect different  regions and transform them. Space thus acquires a temporal  dimension ; following the words of geographer B. Berry, we  have been led to study the "timing of space."  But perhaps the most important progress is that we now  may see the problem of structure , of order, from a different  perspectiv e. As we shall show in Chapter VIII, from the point  of view of dynami cs, be it classical or quantum, there can be  no one time-directed evolution. The "information" as it can be </p><div id="pagenum"><p>50</p></div><p id="page">ORDER OUT OF CHAOS 18  defined in terms of dynamics remains constant in time. This  sounds paradoxical. When we mix two liquids, there would  occur no "evolution" in spite of the fact that we cannot, with­ out using some external device, undo the effect of the mixing.  On the contrary, the entropy law describes the mixing as the  evolution toward a "disorder," toward the most probable  state. We can show now that there is no contradiction between  the two descriptions, but to speak about information, or order,  we have to redefine the units we are considering. The impor­ tant new fact is that we now may establish precise rules to go  from one type of unit to the other. In other words, we have  achieved a microscopic formulation of the evolutionary para­ digm expressed by the second law. As the evolutionary para­ digm encompasses all of chemistry as well as essential parts of  biology and the social sciences , this seems to us an important  conclusion. This insight is quite recent. The process of recon­ ceptualization occurring in physics is far from being complete.  However, our intention is not to shed light on the definitive  acquisitions of science, on its stable and well-established re­ sults. What we wish to do is emphasize the conceptual cre­ ativeness of scientific activity and the future prospects and  new problems it raises. In any case, we now know that we are  only at the beginning of this exploratio n. We shall not see the  end of uncertainty or risk. Thus we have chosen to present  things as we perceive them now, fully aware of how incomplete  our answers are.  Erwin Schrodinger once wrote, to the indignation of many phi­ losophers of science:  . . . there is a tendency to forget that all science is boundl  up with human culture in general, and that scientific find­ ings, even those which at the moment appear the mostj  advanced and esoteric and difficult to grasp, are meaning-!  less outside their cultural context. A theoretical science!  unaware that those of its constructs considered relevanti  and momentou:s arc de:stined eventually to be framed inl  concepts and words that have a grip on the educated com-I  I I  I </p><div id="pagenum"><p>51</p></div><p id="page">19 THE CHALLENGE TO SCIENCE  munity and become part and parcel of the general world  picture-a theoretical science, I say, where this is forgot­ ten, and where the initiated continue musing to each  other in terms that are, at best, understood by a small  group of close fellow travellers, will necessar ily be cut off  from the rest of cultural mankind ; in the long run it is  bound to atrophy and ossify however virulently esoteric  chat may continue within its joyfully isolated groups of  experts.t8  One of the main themes of this book is that of a strong inter­ action of the issues proper to culture as a whole and the inter­ nal conceptual problems of science in particular. We find  questions about time at the very heart of science. Becoming,  irreversibility-these are questions to which generations of  philosophers have also devoted their lives. Today, when his­ tory-be it economic, demographic, or political-is moving at  an unprecedented pace, new questions and new interests re­ quire ·us to enter into new dialogues, to look for a new co­ herence.  However , we know the progress of science has often been  described in terms of rupture, as a shift away from concrete  experience toward a level of abstraction that is increasingly  difficult tc, grasp. We believe that this kind of interpretation is  only a reflection, at the epistemological level, of the historical  situation in which classical science found itself, a conse­ quence of its inability to include in its theoretical frame vast  areas of the relationship between man and his environment.  There doubtless exists an abstract development of scientific  theories. However, the conceptual innovations that have been  decisive for the development of science are not necessar ily of  this type. The rediscovery of time has roots both in the inter­ nal history of science and in the social context in which sci­ ence finds itself today. Discoveries such as those of unstable  elementary particles or of the expanding universe clearly be­ long to the internal history of science, but the general interest  in nonequilibrium situations, in evolving systems, may reflect  our feeling tha t humanity as a whole is today in a transition  period. Many results we shall report in Chapters V and VI, for  example those on oscilla ting chemical reactions, could have  been discovered many years ago, but the study of these non-</p><div id="pagenum"><p>52</p></div><p id="page">ORDER OUT OF CHAOS 20  equilibrium problems was repressed in the cultural and ideo­ logical context of those times.  We are aware that asserting this receptiveness to cultural  content runs counter to the traditional conception of science.  In this view science develops by freeing itself from outmoded  forms of understanding nature; it purifies itself in a process  that can be compared to an "ascesis" of reason. But this in  turn leads to the conclusion that science should be practiced  only by communities living apart, uninvolved in mundane  matters. In this view, the ideal scientific community should be  protected from the pressures, needs, and requirements of so­ ciety. Scientific progress ought to be an essentially autono­ mous process that any "outside" influence, such as the  scientists 's participation in other cultural, social, or economic  activities, would merely disturb or delay.  This ideal of abstraction, of the scientist's withdrawal, finds  an ally in still another ideal, this one concerning the vocation  of a "true" research er, namely, his desire to escape from  worldly vicissitudes. Einstein describes the type of scientist  who would find favor with the ·�ngel of the Lord" should the  latter be given the task of driving from the "T emple of Sci­ ence" all those who are "unworthy''-it is not stated in what  respects. They are generally  ... rather odd, uncommuni cative, solitary fellows, who  despite these common characteristics resemble one an­ other really less than the host of the banished.  What led them into the Temple? ... one of the stron­ gest motives that lead men to art and science is flight  from everyday life with its painful harshness and  wretched dreariness, and from the fetters of one's own  shifting desires. A person with a finer sensibility is driven  to escape from personal existence and to the world of  objective observing (Schauen) and understanding. This  motive can be com pared with the longing that irresistibly  pulls the town-dweller away from his noisy, cramped  quarters and toward the silent, high mountains, where  the eye ranges freely through the still, pure air and traces  the calm contours that seem to be made for eternity.  With this negative motive there goes a positive one. Man  seeks to form for himself, in whatever manner is suitable </p><div id="pagenum"><p>53</p></div><p id="page">21 tHE CHALLENGE TO SCIENCE  for him, a simplified and. lucid image of the world (Bild  der Welt), and so to overcome the world of experience by  striving to replace it to some extent by this image.I9  The incompatibility between the ascetic beauty sought after  by science, on the one hand, and the petty swirl of worldly  experience so keenly felt by Einstein, on the other, is likely to  be reinforced by another incompatibil ity, this one openly Man­ ichean, between science and society , or, more precisely, be·  tween free human creativity and political power. In this case, it  is not in an isolated community or in a temple that research  would have to be carried out, but in a fortress, or else·in a  madhouse, as Duerrenmatt imagined in his play The Physi­ cists.20 There, three physicists discuss the ways and means of  advancing physics while at the same time safeguarding man­ kind from the dire consequences that result when political  powers appropriate the results of its progress. The conclusion  they reach is that the only possible way is that which has al­ ready been chosen by one of them; they all decide to pretend  to be mad, to hide in a lunatic asylum. At the end of the play,  as Fate would have it, this last refuge is discovered to be an  illusion. The director of the asylum, who has been spying on  her patient, steals his results and seizes world power.  Duerrenmatt's play leads to a third conception of scientific  activity: science progresses by reducing the complexity of re­ ality to a hidden simplicity. What the physicist Moebius is try­ ing to conceal in the madhouse is the fact that he has  successfully solved the problem of gravitation, the unified the­ ory of elementary particles, and, ultimately, the Principle of  Universal Discovery, the source of absolute power. Of course,  Duerrenmatt simplifies to make his point, yet it is common ly  held that what is being sought in the "Temple of Science" is  nothing less than the "formula" of the universe. The man of  science, already port rayed as an ascetic, now becomes a kind  of magician, a man apart, the potential holder of a universal  key to all physical phenomena,. thus endowed with a poten­ tially omnipotent knowledge. This brings us back to an issue  we have already raised: it is only in a simple world (especially  in the world of classical science, where complexity merely  veils a fundamental simplicity) that a form of knowledge that  provides a universal key can exist. </p><div id="pagenum"><p>54</p></div><p id="page">ORDER OUT OF CHAOS 22  One of the problems of our time is to overcome attitudes  that tend to justify and reinf orce the isolation of the scientific  commun ity. We must open new channels of communi cation  between science and society. It is in this spirit that this book  has been written. We all know that man is altering his natural  environment on an unprecedented scale. As Serge Moscovici  puts it, he is creating a "new nature. "21 But to understand this  man-made world, we need a science that is not merely a tool  submissive to external interests, nor a cancerous tumor irre­ sponsibly growing on a substrate society.  1\.vo thousand years ago Chuang Tsu wrote:  How [ceaselessly] Heaven revolves! How [constantly]  Earth abides at rest! Do the Sun and the Moon contend  about their respective places? Is there someone presiding  over and directing those things? Who binds and connects  them together? Who causes and maintains them without  trouble or exertion? Or is there perhaps some secret  mechanism in consequence of which they cannot but be  as they are ?22  We believe that we are heading toward a new synthesis, a  new naturalism. Perhaps we will eventually be able to combine  the Western tradition, with its emphasis on experimentation  and quantitative formulations, with a tradition such as the Chi­ nese one, with its view of a spontaneous, self-organizing  world. Toward the beginning of this Introduction , we cited  Jacques Monod. His conclusion was: "The ancient alliance  has been destroyed; man knows at last that he is alone in the  universe's indifferent immensity out of which he emerged only  by chance. "23 Perhaps Monod was right. The ancient alliance  has been shattered . Our role is not to lament the past. It is to  try to discover in the midst of the extraordinary diversity of  the sciences some unifying thread. Each great period of sci­ ence has led to some model of nature. For classical science it  was the clock; for nineteenth-century science, the period of  the Industrial Revolution, it was an engine running down.  What will be the symbol for us? What we have in mind may  perhaps be expressed best by a reference to sculpture, from  Indian or pre-Columbian art to our time. In some of the most </p><div id="pagenum"><p>55</p></div><p id="page">23 THE CHALLENGE TO SCIENCE  beautiful manifestations of sculpture, be it in the dancing  Shiva or in the miniature temples of Guerrero, there appears  very clearly the search for a junction between stillness and  motion, time arrested and time passing. We believe that this  confrontation will give our period its uniqueness. </p><div id="pagenum"><p>56</p></div><p id="page">I  I </p><div id="pagenum"><p>57</p></div><p id="page">BOOK ONE  THE DEWSION OF  THE UNIVERSAL </p><div id="pagenum"><p>58</p></div><p id="page"></p><div id="pagenum"><p>59</p></div><p id="page">CHAPTER I  THE TRIUMPH OF  REASON  The New Moses  Nature and Natures laws lay hid in night:  God said, let Newton be! and all was light.  -Alexan der Pope,  Proposed Epitaph for Isaac 'Newton,  who died in 1727  There is nothing odd in the dramatic tone employedc by Pope.  In the eyes of eighteenth-century England, Newton was the  "new Moses" who had been shown the "tables of the law."  Poets, architects, and sculptors joined to propose monuments;  a whole nation assembled to celebrate this unique event: a  man had discovered the language that nature speaks-and  obeys.  Nature compelled, his piercing Mind obeys,  And gladly shows him all her secret Ways;  'Gainst Mathematicks she has no Defence,  And yields t'experimental Consequence .1  Ethics and politics drew upon the Newtonian episode for ma­ terial on which to "ground" their arguments. Thus De­ saguliers transposed the meaning of the new natural order into  a political lesson: a constitutional monarchy is the best possi­ ble system of government, since the King, like the Sun, has  his power limited by it.  Like Ministers attending ev'ry Glance  Six Worlds sweep round his Throne in Mystick Dance.  27 </p><div id="pagenum"><p>60</p></div><p id="page">ORDER OUT OF CHAOS 28  He turns their Motion from his Devious Course,  And bends their Orbits by Attractive Force;  His Pow'r coerc'd by Laws, still leave them free,  Directs, but not Destroys, their Liberty;2  Although he himself did not encroach upon the domain of the  moral sciences, Newton had no hesitation regarding the uni­ versal nature of the laws set out in his Principia. Nature is  "very consonant and conformable to herself," he asserts in  the celebrated Question 31 of his Opticks-and this strong and  elliptical statement conceals a vast claim: combustion, fer­ mentation, heat, cohesion, magnetism ... there is no natural  process which would not be produced by these active forces­ attractions and repulsion s-that govern both the motion of the  stars and that of freely falling bodies.  Already a national hero before his death, nearly a century later  Newton was to become, mainly through the powerful influence  exerted by Laplace, the symbol of the scientific revolution in  Europe. Astronomers scanned a sky ruled by mathema tics.  The Newtonian system succeeded in overcoming all obsta­ cles. Furthermore, it opened the way to mathematical meth­ ods by which apparent deviations could be accounted for and  even be used to infer the existence of a hitherto unknown  planet. The prediction of the existence of the planet Neptune  was the consecration of the prophetic power inherent in the  Newtonian vision.  At the dawn of the nineteenth century, Newton's name  tended to signify anything that claimed exemplarity. However,  conflicting interpretations of his method are given. Some saw  it as providing a blueprint for quantitative experimentation ex­ pressible in mathemati cs. For them, chemistry found its New­ ton in Lavoisier, who pioneered the systematic use of the  balance. This was indeed a decisive step in the definition of a  quantitative chemistry that took mass conservation as its  Ariadne's thread. According to others, the Newtonian strat­ egy consisted in isolating some central, specific fact and then  using it as the basis for all further deductions concerning a  given set of phenomena. In this perspectiv e Newton's genius  was located in his pragmatism. He did not try to explain grav­ itation; he took it as a fact. Similarly, each discipline should </p><div id="pagenum"><p>61</p></div><p id="page">29 THE TRIUMPH OF REASON  then take some central unexplained fact as its startm!; point.  Physicians thus felt that they were authorized by Newton to  refashion the vitalist conception and to speak of a "vital  force" sui generis, the use of which would give the description  of living phenomena a hoped-for systematic consistency . This  is the same role that affinity, taken as the specificalJy chemical  force of interaction, was calJed upon to play.  Some "true Newtonians" took exception to this prolifera­ tion of forces and reasserted the universality of the explana­ tory power of gravitation. But it was too late. The term  Newtonian was now applied to everything that dealt with a  system of Jaws, with equilibrium, or even to all situations in  which natural order on one side and moral, social, and politi­ cal order on the other could be expressed in terms of an all­ embracing harmony . Romantic philosophers even discovered  in the Newtonian universe an enchanted world animated by  natural forces. More "orthodox" physicists saw in it a me­ chanical world governed by mathema tics. For the positivists it  meant the success of a procedure, a recipe to be identified  with the very definition of science.3  The rest is literature-o ften Newtonian literature: the har­ mony that reigns in the society of stars, the elective affinities  and hostilities giving rise to the "social life" of chemical com­ pounds appear as processes that can be transposed into the  world of human society. No wonder that this period appears as  the Golden Age of Classical Science.  Thday Newtonian science still occupies a unique position.  Some of the basic concepts it introduced represent a definitive  acquisition that has survived all the mutations science has  since undergone. However , today we know that the Golden  Age of Classical Science is gone, and with it also the convic­ tion that Newtonian rationality, even with its various conflict­ ing interpretations, forms a suitable basis for our dialogue with  nature.  A central subject of this book is that of the Newtonian tri­ umph, the continual opening up of new fields of investigation  that have extended Newtonian thought right down to the pres­ . ent day. It also deals with doubts and struggles that arose from  this triumph. Today we are beginning to see more clearly the  limits of Newtonian rationality. A more consistent conception </p><div id="pagenum"><p>62</p></div><p id="page">ORDER OUT OF CHAOS 30  of science and of nature seems to be emerging. This new con­ ception paves the way for a new unity of knowledge and cul­ ture.  A Dehumanized World  ... May God us keep  From single Vision and Newtons sleep!  -William Blake,  in a letter to Thomas Butts  dated November 22, 1802  There is no better illustration of the instability of the cultural  position of Newtonian science than the introduction to a  UNESCO colloquium on the relationship between science and  culture:  For more than a century the sector of scientific activity  has been growing to such an extent within the surround­ ing cultural space that it seems to be replacing the totality  of the culture itself. Some believe that this is merely an  illusion due to its high growth rate and that the lines of  force of this culture will soon reassert themselves and  bring science back into the service of man. Others con­ sider that the recent triumph of science entitles it at last  to rule over the whole of culture which, moreove r, would  deserve to go on being known as such only because it was  transmit ted through the scientific apparatus . Others  again, appalled by the danger of man and society being  manipula ted if they come under the sway of science, per­ ceive the spectre of cultural disaster looming in the dis­ tance.4  In this statement science appears as a cancer in the body of  culture, a cancer whose proliferation threatens to destroy the  whole of cultural life. The question is whether we can domi­ nate science and control its development, or whether we shall  be enslaved. In only one hundred fifty years, science has been </p><div id="pagenum"><p>63</p></div><p id="page">31 THE TRIUMPH OF REASON  downgraded from a source of inspiration for Western culture  to a threat. Not only does it threaten man's material existence,  but also, more subtly, it threatens to destroy the traditions and  experiences that are most deeply rooted in our cultural life. It  is not just the technolo gical fallout of one or another scientific  breakthrough that is being accused, but "the spirit of science"  itself.  Whether the accusation refers to a global skepticism exuded  by scientific culture or to specific conclusions reached  through scientific theories, it is often asserted today that sci­ ence is debasing our world. What for generations had been a  source of joy and amazement withers at its touch. Everything  it touches is dehumaniz ed.  Oddly enough, the idea of a fatal disenchantment brought  about by scientific progress is an idea held not only by the  critics of science but often also by those who defend or glorify  it. Thus, in his book The Edge of Objectivity, historian C. C.  Gillispie expresses sympathy for those who criticize science  and constantly endeavor to blunt the "cutting edge of objec­ tivity":  Indeed, the renewals of the subjective approach to nature  make a pathetic theme. Its ruins lie strewn like good in­ tentions aU along the ground traversed by science, until it  survives only in strange corners like Lysenkoism and an­ throposophy, where nature is socialized or moralized.  Such survivals are relics of the perpetual attempt to es­ cape the consequences of western man's most charac­ teristic and successful campaign , which must doom to  conquer. So like any thrust in the face of the inevitable,  romantic natural philosophy has induced every nuance of  mood from desperation to heroism. At the ugliest, it is  sentimental or vulgar hostility to intellect. At the noblest,  it inspired Diderot's naturalistic and moralizing science,  Goethe's personification of nature, the poetry of Words­ worth, and the philosophy of Alfred North Whitehead , or  of any other who would find a place in science for our  qualitative and aesthetic appreciation of nature. It is the  science of those who would make botany of blossoms and  meteorology of sunsets. 5 </p><div id="pagenum"><p>64</p></div><p id="page">ORDER OUT OF CHAOS 32  Thus science leads to a tragic, metaphysical choice. Man has  to choose between the reassuring but irrational temptation to  seek in nature a guarantee of human values, or a sign pointing  to a fundamental corelatedness, and fidelity to a rationality  that isolates him in a silent world.  The echoes of another leitmotiv-domi nation-mingle with  that of disenchantment. A disenchanted world is, at the same  time, a world liable to control and manipula tion. Any science  that conceives of the world as being governed according to a  universal theoretical plan that reduces its various riches to the  drab applications of general laws thereby becomes an instru­ ment of domination. And man, a stranger to the world, sets  himself up as its master.  This disenchantment has taken various forms in recent de­ cades. It is outside the aim of this book to study systematically  the various forms of antiscience. In Chapter III we shall pre­ sent a fuller reaction of Western thought to the surprising tri­ umph of Newtonian rationality. Here let us only note that at  present there is a shift of popular attitudes to nature associated  with a widespread but in our opinion erroneous belief that  there exists a fundamental antagonism between science and  "naturalism." To illustrate at least some of the forms anti­ scientific criticism has taken in recent years, we have chosen  three examples. First, Heidegger, whose philosophy holds a  deep fascination for contempo rary thought. We shall also refer  to the criticisms stated by Arthur Koestler and by the great  historian of science, Alexander Koyre.  Martin Heidegger directs his criticism against the very core  of the scientific endeavor, which he sees as fundamentally re­ lated to a permanent aim, the domination of nature. Therefore  Heidegger claims that scientific rationality is the final accom­ plishment of something that has been implicitly present since  ancient Gr eece, namely, the will to dominate, which is at work  in any rational discussion or enterprise, the violence lurking in  all positive and communicable knowledge. Heidegger em pha­ sizes what he·calls the technolo gical and scientific "framing"  (Geste/1), 6 which leads to the general setting to work of the  world and of men.  Thus Heidegger does not present a detailed analysis of any  particula r techno logical or scientific product or process. What  he challenges is the essence of technolo gy, the way each thing </p><div id="pagenum"><p>65</p></div><p id="page">33 THE TRIUMPH OF REASON  is taken into account. Each theory is part of the implemen ta­ tion of the master plan that makes up Western history. What  we call a scientific "theory" implies, following Heidegger , a  way of questioning things by which they are reduced to en­ slavement. The scientist, like the technologi st, is a toy in the  hands of the will to power disguised as thirst for knowledge;  his very approach to things subjects them to systematic vio­ lence.  Modern physics is not experimental physics because it  uses experimental devices in its questioning of nature.  Rather the reverse is true. Because physics, already as  pure theory, requests nature to manifest itself in terms of  predictable forces, it sets up the experiments precisely  for the sole purpose of asking whether and how nature  follows the scheme preconceived by science. 7  Similarly, Heidegger is not concerned about the fact that in­ dustrial pollution, for example, has destroyed all animal life in  the Rhine. What does concern him is that the river has been  put to man's service.  The hydroelectric plant is set into the current of the  Rhine. It sets the Rhine to supplying its hydraulic pres­ sure, which then sets the turbines turning .... The hy­ droelectric plant is not built into the Rhine river as was  the old bridge that joined bank wi'th bank for hundreds of  years. Rather the river is dammed up into the power  plant. What the river is now, namely, a water supplier,  derives from out of the essence of the power station.s  The old bridge over the Rhine is valued not as a proof of  soundly tested abilit y, of painstaking and accurate observa­ tion, but because it does not "use" the river.  Heidegger's criticisms, taking the very ideal of a positive,  communicable knowledge as a threat, echo some themes of  the antiscience movement to which we referred in the Intro­ duction. But the idea of an indissociable link between science  and the will to dominate also permeates some apparently very  different assessm ents of our present-da y situation. For in­ stance, under the very suggestiv e title "The Coming of the </p><div id="pagenum"><p>66</p></div><p id="page">ORDER OUT OF CHAOS 34  Golden Age, "9 Gunther Stent states that science is now reach­ ing its limits. We are close to a point of diminishing returns,  where the questions we direct to things in order to master  them become more and more complicated and devoid of inter­ est. This marks the end of progress, but it is the opportunity  for humanity to stop its frantic efforts, to end the age-old  struggle against nature, and to accept a static and comf ortable  peace. We wish to show that the relative dissociation between  the scientific knowledge of an object and the possibility of  mastering it, far from marking the end of science, signals a  host of new perspectives and problems. Scientific understand­ ing of the world around us is just beginning. There is yet  another idea of science that we feel is potentially just as detri­ mental, namely, the fascination with a mysterious science  that, by paths of reasoning inaccessible to common mortals,  will lead to results that can, in one fell swoop, challenge the  meaning of basic concepts such as time, space, causality ,  mind, or matter. This kind of "mystery science," the results of  which are imagined to be capable of shattering the framework  of any traditional conceptio n, has actually been encouraged  by the successive "revelations" of relativity and quantum me­ chanics. It is certainly true that some of the most imaginative  steps in the past, Einstein's interpretation of gravitation as a  space curvature or Dirac's antiparticles, for example, have  shaken some seemingly well-establ ished conceptio ns. Thus  there is a very delicate balance between the readiness to imag­ ine that science can produce anything and a kind of down-to­ earth realism. Today the balance is strongly shifting toward a  revival of mysticism, be it in the press media or even in science  itself, especially among cosmologis ts.IO It has even been sug­ gested by certain physicists and popularizers of science that  mysterious relationships exist between parapsychology and  quantum physics. Let us cite Koestler:  We have heard a whole chorus of Nobel Laureates in  physics informing us that matter is dead, causality is  dead, determinism is dead. If that is so, let us give them a  decent burial, with a requiem of electronic music. It is  time for us to draw the lesson from twentieth-century  post-mechanistic scienc e, and to get out of the strait-</p><div id="pagenum"><p>67</p></div><p id="page">36 THE TRIUMPH OF REASON  jacket which nineteenth-century materialism imposed on  our philosophical outlook. Paradoxically , had that out­ look kept abreast with modern science itself, instead of  lagging a century behind it, we would have been liberated  from that strait-jacket long ago .... But once this is rec­ ognized, we might become more receptive to phenomena  around us which one-sided emphasis on physical science  has made us ignore; might feel the draught that is blowing  through the chinks of the causal edifice; pay more atten­ tion to confluent ial events; include the paranormal phe­ nomena in our concept of normality; and realise that we  have been living in the "Country of the Blind." II  We do not wish to judge or condemn a priori. There may be in  some of the apparently fantastic propositions we hear today  some seed of new knowledge . Nevertheless, we believe that  leaps into the unimaginable are far too simple escapes from  the concrete complexity of our world. We do not believe we  shall leave the "Country of the Blind" in a day, since con­ ceptual blindness is not the main reason for the problems and  contradictions our society has failed to solve.  Our disagreement with certain criticisms or distortions of  science does not mean, however, that we wish to reject aJJ crit­ icisms. Let us take, for instance, the position of Alexander  Koyre, who has made outstanding contributions to the under­ standing of the development of modern science. In his study of  the significance and implications of the Newtonian synthesis,  Koyre wrote:  Yet there is something for which Newton-or better to  say not Newton alone, but modern science in general­ can still be made responsible: it is the splitting of our  world in two. I have been saying that modern science  broke down the barriers that separated the heavens and  the earth, and that it united and unified the universe. And  that is true. But, as I have said, too, it did this by sub­ stituting for our world of quality and sense perception,  the world in which we live, and love, and die, another  world-t he world of quantity, of reified geometry, a world  in which, though there is a place for everything, there is </p><div id="pagenum"><p>68</p></div><p id="page">ORDER OUT OF CHAOS 36  no place for man. Thus the world of science-the real  world-became estranged and utterly divorced from the  world of life, which science has been unable to explain­ not even to explain away by calling it "subjective."  True, these worlds are everyday-and even more and  more-connected by the praxis. Yet for theory they are  divided by an abyss.  1\vo worlds: this means two truths. Or no truth at all.  This is the tragedy of the modern mind which "solved  the riddle of the universe," but only to replace it by an­ other riddle: the riddle of itself.I2  However, we hear in the conclusions of Koyre the same  theme expressed by Pascal and Monod-this tragic feeling of  estrangement. Koyre 's criticism does not challenge scientific  thinking but rather classical science based on the Newtonian  perspective. We no longer have to settle for the previous di­ lemma of choosing between a science that reduces man to  being a stranger in a disenchanted world and antiscientifi c,  irrational protests. Koyre's criticism does not invoke the limits  of a "strait-jacket" rationality but only the incapacity of classi­ cal science to deal with some fundamental aspects of the  world in which we live.  Our position in this book is that the science described by  Koyre is no longer our science. Not because we are concerned  today with new, unimaginable objects, closer to magic than to  logic, but because as scientists we are now beginning to find  our way toward the complex processes forming the world with  which we are most familiar, the natural world in which living  creatures and their societies develop. Indeed, today we are be­ ginning to go beyond what Koyre called "the world of quan­ tity" into the world of "qualities" and thus of "becoming."  This will be the main subject of Books One and 1\vo. We be­ lieve it is precisely this transition to a new description that  makes this moment in the history of science so exciting. Per­ haps it is not an exaggerat ion to say that it is a period like the  time of the Greek atomists or the Renaissance, periods in  which a new view of nature was being born. But let us first  return to Newtonian science, certainly one of the great mo­ ments of human history. </p><div id="pagenum"><p>69</p></div><p id="page">37 THE TRIUMPH OF REASON  The Newtonian Synthesis  What lay behind the enthusiasm of Newton's contemp oraries,  their conviction that the secret of the universe, the truth about  nature, had finally been revealed? Several lines of thought,  probably present from the very beginning of humanity, con­ verge in Newton's synthesis: first of all, science as a way of  acting on our environment. Newtonian science is indeed an  active science; one of its sources is the knowledge of the medi­ eval craftsmen, the knowledge of the builders of machines.  This science provides the means for systematically acting on  the world, for predicting and modifying the course of natural  processes, for conceiving devices that can harness and exploit  the forces and material resources of nature.  In this sense, modern science is a continuation of the age­ less.efforts of man to organize and exploit the world in which  he lives. We have very scanty knowledge about the early  stages of this endeavor. However , it is possible, in retrospect,  to assess the knowledge and skills required for the "Neolithic  Revolution" to take place, when man gradually began to orga­ nize his natural and social environment, using new techniques  to exploit nature and to organize his society. We still use, or  have used until quite recently, Neolithic techniques- for ex­ ample, animal and plant species either bred or selected, weav­ ing, pottery, metalworki ng. Our social organization was for a  long time based on the same techniques of writing, geometry,  and arithmetic as those required to organize the hierarchically  differentiated and structured social groups of the Neolithic  city-states. Thus we cannot help acknowledging the continuity  that exists between Neolithic techniques and the scientific and  industrial revolutions.t3  Modern science has thus extended this ancient endeavor,  amplifying it and constantly speeding up its rhythm. Never­ theless, this does not exhaust the significance of science in the  sense given to it by the Newtonian synthesis.  In addition to the various techniques used in a given society,  we find a number of beliefs and myths that seek to understand  man's place in nature. Like myths and cosmologies, science's </p><div id="pagenum"><p>70</p></div><p id="page">ORDER OUT OF CHAOS 38  endeavor is to understand the nature of the world, the way it is  organized, and man's place in it.  From our standpoint it is quite irrelevant that the early spec­ ulations of the pre-Socratics appear to be adapted from the  Hesiodic myth of creation-tha t is, the initial polarization of  Heaven and Earth, the desir e aroused by Eros, the birth of the  first generations of gods to form the differentiated cosmic  powers, discord and strife, alternating atrocities and vendet­ tas, until stability is finally reached under the rule of Justice  (dike). What does matter is that, in the space of a few genera­ tions, the pre-Socratics collected, discussed, and criticized  some of the concepts we are still trying to organize in order to  understand the relation between being and becoming, or the  appearance of order out of a hypothetical ly undifferentiated  initial environment.  Where does the instability of the homogeneous come from?  Why does it differentiate spontaneou sly? Why do things exist  at all? Are they the fragile and mortal result of an injustice, a  disequilibrium in the static equilibrium of forces between con­ flicting natural powers? Or do the forces that create and drive  things exist autonomously -rival powers of love and hate lead­ ing to birth, growth, decline, and dispersion? Is change an illu­ sion or is it, on the contrary, the unceasing struggle between  opposites that constitutes things? Can qual itative change be  reduced to the motion in a vacuum, of atoms differing only in  their forms, or do atoms themselves consist of a multitude of  qualitatively different germs, each unlike the others? And last,  is the harmony of the world mathemati cal? Are numbers the  key to nature?  The numerical regularities among sounds that were dis­ covered by the Pythagoreans are still part of our present theo­ ries. The mathematical schemes worked out by the Greeks  form the first body of abstract thought in European history­ that is, a thought whose results are communicable and re­ producible for all reasoning human beings. The Greeks  achieved for the first time a form of deductiv e knowledge that  contained a degree of certainty unaffected by convictions, ex­ pectations, or passions.  The most impo rtant aspect common to Greek thought and  to modern science, which contrasts with the religious and </p><div id="pagenum"><p>71</p></div><p id="page">39 THE TRIUMPH OF REASON  mythicaI form of inquiry , is thus the emphasis on criticaI dis­ cussion and verification.14  Little is known about this pre-Socratic philosophy that grew  up in the lonian cities and the colonies of Magna Graecia.  Thus we can only speculate about the relationships that might  have existed between the development of theoretical and cos­ mological hypotheses and the crafts and technological ac­ tivities that tlourished in those cities. Tradition teUs that as a  result of a hostile religious and social reaction, philosophers  were accused of atheism and were either exiled or put to death.  This early "recall to order" may serve as a symbol of the im­ portance of social factors in the origin, and above alI the  growth, of conceptual innovations. To understand the success  of modem science we also have to explain why its fóunders  were as a rule not unduly persecuted and their theoretical ap­ proach repressed in favor of a form of knowledge more consis­ tent with social anticipations and convictions.  Be that as it may, from Plato and Aristotle onward, the limits  were set, and thought was channeled in socially acceptable  directions. ln partic ular, the distinction between theoretical  thinking and technologi cal activity was established. The  words we still use today-machine, mechanical, engineer­ have a similar meaning. They do not refer to rational knowl­ edge but to cunning and expediency . The idea was not to leam  about natural processes in order to utilize them more effec­ tively, but to deceive nature, to "machinate" against it-that  is, to work wonders and create effects extraneous to the "nat­ ural order" of things. The fields of practical manipulation and  that of the rational understanding of nature were thus rigidly  separated. Archimedes' status is merely that of an engineer;  his mathematical analysis of the equilibrium of machines is not  considered to be applicable to the world of nature, at least  within the framework of traditional physics. ln contrast, the  Newtonian synthesis expresses a systematic alliance between  manipulation and theoretical understanding.  There is a third important element that found its expression  in the Newtonian revolution. There is a striking contrast,  which each of us has probably experienced, between the quiet  world of the stars and planets and thé ephemeral, turbulent  world around uso As Mircea Eliade has emphasized, in many </p><div id="pagenum"><p>72</p></div><p id="page">ORDER OUT OF CHAOS 40  ancient civilizations there is a separation between profane  space and sacred space, a division of the world into an ordi·  nary space that is subject to chance and degradation and a  sacred one that is meaningful, independent of contingency and  history. This was the very contrast Aristotle established be­ tween the world of the stars and our sub lunar world. This con­ trast is crucial to the way in which Aristotle evaluated the  possibility of a quantitative description of nature. Since the  motion of the celestial bodies is not change but a "divine"  state that is eternally the same, it ntay be described by means  of mathematical idealizations. Mathematical precision and  rigor are not relevant to the sub lunar world. Imprecise natural  processes can only be subjected to an approximate descrip­ tion.  In any case, for an Aristotelian it is more interesting to  know why a process occurs than to describe how it occurs, or  rather, these two aspects are indivisible . One of the main  sources of Aristotle's thinking was the observation of em­ bryonic growth, a highly organized process in which interlock ­ ing, although apparently independent, events participate in a  process that seems to be part of some global plan. Like the de­ veloping embryo, the whole of Aristotelian nature is organized  according to final causes. The purpose of all change, if it is in  keeping with the nature of things, is to realize in each being the  perfection of its intelligible essence. Thus this essence, which,  in the case of living creatures, is at one and the same time their  final, formal, and effective cause, is the key to the understand­ ing of nature. In this sense the "birth of modern science," the  clash between the Aristotelians and Galileo, is a clash be­ tween two forms of rationality. IS  In Galileo 's view the question of "why," so dear to the Aris­ totelians, was a very dangerous way of addressing nature, at  least for a scientist. The Aristotelians, on the other hand, con­ sidered Galileo's attitude as a form of irrational fanaticism.  Thus, with the coming of the Newtonian system it was a  new universality that triumphed, and its emergence unified  what till then had appeared as divided. </p><div id="pagenum"><p>73</p></div><p id="page">41 THE TRIUMPH OF REASON  The Experimental Dialogue  We have already emphasized one of the essential elements of  modern science: the marriage between theory and pra ctice,  the blending of the desire to shape the world and the desire to  understand it. For this to be possible, it was not enough, de­ spite the empiricists' beliefs, merely to respect observed facts.  On certain points, including even the description of mechani­ cal motion, it was in fact Aristotelian physics that was more  easily brought into contact with empirical facts. The experi­ mental dialogue with nature discovered by modern science in­ volves activity rather than passive obse rvation. What must be  done is to manipula te physical reality, to "stage" it in such a  way that it conforms as closely as possible to a theoretical  description. The phenomenon studied must be prepared and  isolated until it approximates some ideal situation that may be  physically unattainable but that conforms to the conceptual  scheme adopted.  By way of example, let us take the description of a system of  pulleys, a classic since the time of Archime des, whose reason­ ing has been extended by modern scientists to cover all simple  machines. It is astonishing to find that the modern explanation  has eliminated, on the grounds that it is irrelevant, the very  thing that Aristotelian physics set out to explain, namely, the  fact that, using a typical image, a stone "resists" a horse's  efforts to pull it and that this resistance can be "overcome" by  applying traction through a system of pulleys. Nature, accord­ ing to Galileo, never gives anything away, never does some­ thing for nothing, and can never be tricked; it is absurd to  think that by cunning or by using some stratagem we can make  it perform extra work .I6 Since the work the horse is able to  perform is the same with or without the pulleys, the effect  produced must be the same. This then becomes the starting  point for a mechanical explanati on, which thus refers to an  idealized world. In this world the "new" effect-the stone fi­ nally set in motion-is of secondary importance; and the  stone's resistance is described only qualitatively , in terms of  friction and heating. Instead, what is described accurately is  the ideal situation, in which a relationship of equivalence links </p><div id="pagenum"><p>74</p></div><p id="page">ORDER OUT OF CHAOS 42  the cause, the work done by the horse, to the effect, the mo­ tion of the stone. In this ideal world, the horse can, in any  case, shift the stone, and the system of pulleys has the sole  effect of modifying the way the pulling efforts are transmitted ;  instead of moving the stone over a distance L, equal to the  distance it travels while pulling the rope, the horse only moves  it over a distance Lin, where n depends on the number of  pulleys. Like all simple machines, the pulleys form a passive  device that can only transmit motion without producing it.  The experimental dialogue thus corresponds to a highly spe­ cific procedure. Nature is cross-examined through experimen­ tation, as if in a court of law, in the name of a priori principles.  Nature's answers are recorded with the utmost accuracy, but  relevance of those answers is assessed in terms of the very  idealizations that guided the experiment. All the rest does not  count as information , but is idle chatter, negligible secondary  effects. It may well be that nature rejects the theoretical hy­ pothesis in question. Nevertheless, the latter is still used as a  standard against which to measure the implications and the  significance of the response, whatever it may be. It is precisely  this imperative way of questioning nature that Heidegger re­ fers to in his argument against scientific rationality.  For us the experimental method is truly an art-that is, it is  based on special skills and not on general rules. As such there  are never any guarantees of success and one always remains at  the mercy of triviality or poor judgment. No methodological  principle can eliminate the risk, for instance, of persisting in a  blind alley of inquiry. The experimental method is the art of  choosing an interesting question and of scanning all the con­ sequences of the theoretical framework thereby implied, all  the ways nature could answer in the theor etical language  chosen. Amid the concrete complexity of natural phenomena,  one phenomenon has to be selected as the most likely to em­ body the theory's implications in an unambiguous way. This  phenomenon will then be abstracted from its environment and  "staged" to allow the theory to be tested in a reproducible and  communicable way.  Although this experimental procedure was criticized right  from the outset, ignored by the empiricists, and attacked by  others on the grounds that it was a kind of torture, a way of  putting nature on the rack, it survived all the modifications of </p><div id="pagenum"><p>75</p></div><p id="page">43 THE TRIUMPH OF REASON  the theoretica l content of scientific descriptions and ultimately  defined the new method of investigation introduced by mod­ ern science.  Experimental procedure can even become a tool for purely  theoretical analysis. It is then a "thought experiment," the  imagining of experimental situations governed entirely by the­ oretical principles, which permits the exploration of the con­ sequences of these principles in a given situation. Such  thought experiments played a crucial role in Galileo's work,  and today they are at the center of investigations about the  consequences of the conceptual upheavals in contemp orary  physics, namely, relativity and quantum mechanics. One of  the most famous of such thought experiments is Einstein's fa­ mous train, from which an observer can measure the velocity  of propagation of a ray of light emitted along an embankment,  that is, moving at a velocity c in a reference system with re­ spect to which the train is moving at a velocity v. According to  classical reasoning, the observer on the train should attribute  to the light, which is traveling in the same direction as he is, a  velocity of c- v. However, this classical conclusion represents  precisely the absurdity that the thought experiment was de­ signed to expose. In relativity theory, the velocity of light ap­ pears as a universal constant of nature. Whatever inertial  referer.ce system is used, the velocity of light is always the  same. And since then Einstein's train has gone on exploring  the physical consequences of this fundamental change.  The experimental method is central to the dialogue with na­ ture established by modern science. Nature questioned in this  way is, of course, simplified and occasionally mutilated. This  does not deprive it of its capacity to refute most of the hypoth­ eses we can imagine. Einstein used to say that nature says  "no" to most of the questions it is asked, and occasionally  "perhaps." The scientist does not do as he pleases, and he  cannot force nature to say only what he wants to hear. He  cannot, at least in the long run, project upon it his most cher­ ished desires and expectations. He actually runs a greater risk  and plays a more dangerous game the better his tactics suc­ ceed in encircling nature, in setting it more squarely with its  back to the wall.l7 Moreover, it is true that, whether the an­ swer is "yes" or "no," it will be expressed in the same theoret­ icallanguage as the question. However, this language, too, </p><div id="pagenum"><p>76</p></div><p id="page">ORDER OUT OF CHAOS 44  develops according to a complex historical process involving  nature's replies in the past and its relations with other theoreti­ cal languages. In addition, new questions arise corresponding  to the changing interests of each period. This sets up a com­ plex relationship between the specific rules of the scientific  game-part icularly the experimental method of reasoning  with nature, which places the greatest constraint on the  game-and a cultural network to which, sometimes unwit­ tingly, the scientist belongs.  We believe that the experimental dialogue is an irreversible  acquisition of human culture. It actually provides a guarantee  that when nature is explored by man it is treated as an inde­ pendent being. It forms the basis of the communicable and  reproducible nature of scientific results. However partially na­ ture is allowed to speak, once it has expressed itself, there is  no further dissent: nature never lies.  The Myth at the Origin of Science  The dialogue between man and nature was accurately per­ ceived by the founders of modern science as a basic step to­ ward the intelligibility of nature. But their ambitions went even  farther. Galileo, and those who came after him, conceived of  science as being capable of discovering global truths about  nature. Nature not only would be written in a mathematical  language that can be deciphered by experimenta tion, but there  would actually exist only one such language. Following this  basic conviction, the world is seen as homogene ous, and local  experimentation can reveal global truth. The simplest phe­ nomena studied by science can thus be interpreted as the key  to understanding nature as a whole; the complexity of the lat­ ter is only apparent, and its diversity can be explained in terms  of the universal truth embodied, in Galileo's case, in the math­ ematical laws of motion.  This conviction has survived centuries. In an excellent set  of lectures presented on the BBC several years ago, Richard  Feynman ts compared nature to a huge chess game. The com­ plexity is only apparent; each move follows simple rules. In its  early days, modern science quite possibly needed this convic-</p><div id="pagenum"><p>77</p></div><p id="page">45 THE TRIUMPH OF REASON  tion of being able to reach global truth. Such a conviction  added an immense value to the experimental method and, to a  certain extent, inspired it. Perhaps a revolutionary conception  of the world, one as all-embracing as the "biological" con­ ception of the Aristotelian world, was necessary to throw off  the yoke of tradition, to give the champions of experimentation  a strength of conviction and a power of argument that enabled  them to hold their own against the previous forms of rational­ ism. Perhaps a metaphysical conviction was needed to trans­ mute the craftsman's and machine builder's knowledge into a  new method for the rational exploration of nature. We may  also wonder what the implications of the existence of this kind  of "mythical" conviction are for explaining the way modern  science's first developments were accepted in the social con­ text. On this highly controversial issue, we shall restrict our­ selves to a few remarks of a quite general nature for the sole  purpose of pinpointing the problem-that is, the problem of a  science whose advance has been felt by some as the triumph  of reason, but by others as a disillusionment, as the painful  discovery of the robotlike stupidity of nature.  It seems hard to deny the fundamental importance of social  and economic factors-particularly the development of crafts­ men's techniques in the monasterie s, where the residual knowl­ edge of a destroyed world was preserved, and later in the  bustling merchant cities-in the birth of experimental science,  which is a systematized form of part of the craftsmen's knowl­ edge.  Moreover , a comparative analysis such as Needham'sl9 ex­ poses the decisive importance of social structures at the close  of the Middle Ages. Not only was the class of craftsmen and  potential technical innovators not held in contempt, as it was  in ancient Greece, but, like the craftsmen, the intellectuals  were, in the main, independent of the authorities. They were  free entrepreneurs, craftsmen-inventors in search of patron­ age, who tended to look for novelty and to exploit all the op­ portunities it afforded, however dangerous they may have been  for the social order. On the other hand, as Needham points  out, Chinese men of science were officials, bound to observe  the rules of the bureaucr acy. They formed an integral part of  the state, whose primary objective was to keep law and order.  The compass, the printing press, and gunpowder, all of which </p><div id="pagenum"><p>78</p></div><p id="page">ORDER OUT OF CHAOS 46  were to contribute to undermining the foundations of medieval  society and to project Europe into the modern era, were dis­ covered much earlier in China but had a much less destabiliz­ ing effect on its society. The enterprising European merchant  society appears in contrast as particularly well suited to stim­ ulate and sustain the dynamic and innovative growth of mod­ ern science in its early stages.  However, the question remains. We know that the builders  of machines used mathematical concepts- gear ratios, the dis­ placements of the various working parts, and the geometry of  their relative motions. But why was mathematization not re­ stricted to ma chines? Why was natural motion conceived of in  the image of a rationalized machine? This question may also  be asked in connection with the clock, one of the triumphs of  medieval craftsmanship that was soon to set the rhythm of life  in the larger med ieval towns. Why did the clock almost imme­ diately become the very symbol of world order? In this last  question lies perhaps some elements of an answer. A watch is  a contrivance governed by a rationality that lies outside itself,  by a plan that is blindly executed by its inner workings. The  clock world is a metaphor suggestive of God the Watchmaker,  the rational master of a robotlike nature. At the origin of mod­ ern science, a "resonance" appears to have been set up be­ tween theological discourse and theoretical and experimental  activity-a resonance that was no doubt likely to amplify and  consolidate the claim that scientists were in the process of dis­ covering the secret of the "great machine of the universe ."  Of course, the term resonance covers an extremely complex  problem. It is not our intention to state, nor are we in any  position to affirm, that religious discourse in any way deter­ mined the birth of theoretical science, or of the "world view"  that happened to develop in conjunction with experimental ac­ tivity. By using the term resonance-that is, mutual amplifica­ tion of two discourse s-we have deliberately chosen an  expression that does not assume whether it was theological  discourse or the "scientific myth" that came first and trig­ gered the other.  Let us note that to some philosophers the question of the  "Christian origin" of Western science is not only the question  of the stabilization of the concept of nature as an automaton,  but also the question of some "essential" link between experi-</p><div id="pagenum"><p>79</p></div><p id="page">47 THE TRIUMPH OF REASON  mental science as such and Western civilization in its Hebraic  and Greek components. For Alfred North Whitehead this link  is situated at the level of instinctive conviction. Such a convic­ tion was "needed" to inspire the "scientific faith" of the  founders of modern science:  I mean the inexpugnable belief that every detailed occur­ rence can be correlated with its antecedents in a perfectly  definite manner, exemplifying general principles. Without  this belief the incredible labours of scientists would be  without hope. It is this instinctive conviction, vividly  poised before the imagination, which is the motive power  of research: that there is a secret, a secret which can be  unveiled . How has this conviction been so vividly im­ planted in the European mind?  When we compare this tone of thought in Europe with  the attitude of other civilizations when left to themselves,  there seems but one source for its origin. It must come  from the medieval insistence on the rationality of God,  conceived as with the personal energy of Jehovah and  with the rationality of a Greek philosopher. Every detail  was supervised and ordered: the search into nature could  only result in the vindication of the faith in rationality.  . Remember that I am not talking of the explicit beliefs of a  few individuals. What I mean is the impress on the Euro­ pean mind arising from the unquestioned faith of cen­ turies. By this I mean the instinctive tone of thought and  not a mere creed of words.2o  We will not consider this matter further. It would be out of  the question to .. prove" that modern science could have orig­ inated only in Christian Europe. It is not even necessary to ask  if the founders of modern science drew any real inspiration  from theological arguments. Whether or not they were sin­ cere, the important point is that those arguments made the  speculations of modern science socially credible and accept­ able, over a period of time varying from country to country.  Religious references were still frequent in English scientific  texts of the nineteenth century. Remarkably enough, in the  present-day revival of interest in mysticism, the direction of  the argument appears reversed. It is now science that appears  to lend credibility to mystical affirmation. </p><div id="pagenum"><p>80</p></div><p id="page">ORDER OUT OF CHAOS 48  The question we have confronted here obviously leads to·  ward a multitude of problems in which theological and scien·  tific issues are inextricably bound up with the "external "  history of science, that is, the description of the relationship  between the form and content of scientific knowledge on the  one hand, and on the other, the use to which it is put in its  social, economic, and institutional context. As we have al­ ready said, the only point we are presently interested in is the  very particular character and implications of scientific dis·  course that was amplified by resonance with theological dis­ courses.  Needham 2t tells of the irony with which Chinese men oflet·  ters of the eighteenth century greeted the Jesuits' announce­ ment of the triumphs of modern science. The idea that nature  was governed by simple, knowable laws appeared to them as a  perfect example of anthropocentric foolishness. Needham be­ lieves that this "foolishness" has deep cultural roots. In order  to illustrate the great differences between the Western and  Chinese conception s, he cites the animal trials held in the  Middle Ages. On several occasions such freaks as a cock who  supposedly laid eggs were solemnly condemned to death and  burned for having infringed the laws of nature, which were  equated with the laws of God. Needham explains how, in  China, the same cock would, in all likelihood, merely have  disappeared discreetly. It was not guilty of any crime, but its  freakish behavior clashed with natural and social harmony .  The governor of the province or even the emperor might find  himself in a delicate situation if the misbehavior of the cock  became known. Needham comments that, according to a  philosophic conception dominant in China, the cosmos is in  spontaneous harmony and the regularity of phenomena is not  due to any external authority. On the contrary, this harmony in  nature, society, and the heavens originates from the equi­ librium among these processes. Stable and interdependent,  they resonate with each other in a kind of nonconcerted har­ mony. If any law were involved, it would be a law that no one,  neither God nor man, had ever conceived of. Such a law would  also have to be expressed in a language undecipherable by  man and not be a law established by a creator conceived in our  own image. </p><div id="pagenum"><p>81</p></div><p id="page">49 THE TRIUMPH OF REASON  Needham concludes by asking the following question:  In the outlook of modern science there is, of course, no  residue of the notions of command and duty in the  "Laws" of Nature. They are now thought of as statistical  regularities, valid only in given times and places, descrip­ tions not prescription s, as Karl Pearson put it in a famous  chapter. The exact degree of subjectivity in the formula­ tions of scientific law has been hotly debated during the  whole period from Mach to Eddington, and such ques­ tions cannot be followed further here. The problem is  whether the recognition of such statistical regularities  and their mathematical expression could have been  reached by any other road than that which Western sci­ ence actually travelled. Was perhaps the state of mind in  which an egg-laying cock could be prosecuted at law nec­ essary in a culture which should later have the property  of producing a Kepler?22  It must now be stressed that scientific discourse is in no way  a mere transposition of traditional religious views. Obviously  the world described by classical physics is not the world of  Genesis, in which God created light, heaven, earth, and the  living species, the world ·where Providence has never ceased  to act, spurring man on toward a history where his salvation is  at stake. The world of classical physics is an atemporal world  which, if created, must have been created in one fell swoop,  somewhat as an engineer creates a robot before letting it func­ tion alone. In this sense, physics has indeed developed in op­ position to both religion and the traditional philosophies. And  yet we know that the Christian God was actually called upon  to provide a basis for the world's intelligibili ty. In fact, one can  speak here of a kind of "convergence" between the interests  of theologians, who held that the world had to acknowledge  God's omnipotence by its total submission to Him, and of  physicists seeking a world of mathematizable processes.  In any case, the Aristotelian world destroyed by modern sci­ ence was unaccepta ble to both these theologians and physicists.  This ordered, harmoniou s, hierarchical, and rational world  was too independent, the beings inhabiting it too powerful and </p><div id="pagenum"><p>82</p></div><p id="page">ORDER OUT OF CHAOS 50  active, and their subservience to the absolute sovereign too  suspect and limited for the needs of many theologia ns.23 On  the other hand, it was too complex and qualitatively differenti­ ated to be mathematized.  The "mechanized" nature of modern science, created and  ruled according to a plan that totally dominates it, but of which  it is unaware, glorifies its creator, and was thus admirably  suited to the needs of both theologians and the physicists. Al­ though Leibniz had endeavored to demonstrate that mathema­ tization is compatible with a world that can display active and  qualitativ ely differentiated behavior, scientists and theologians  joined forces to describe nature as a mindless, passive me­ chanics that was basically alien to freedom and the purposes  of the human mind. 'i\ dull affair, soundless, scentless, colour­ less, merely the hurrying of matter, endless, meaningle ss, "24  as Whitehead observes. This Christian nature, stripped of any  property that permits man to identify himself with the ancient  harmony of natural "becoming ," leaving man alone, face to  face with God, thus converged with the nature that a single  language , and not the thousand mathematical voices heard by  Leibniz, was sufficient to describe.  Theology may also help comment on man's odd position  when he laboriously deciphers the laws governing the world.  Man is emphatically not part of the nature he objectively de­ scribes; he dominates it from the outside. Indeed, for Galileo,  the human soul, created in God's image, is capable of grasping  the intelligible truths underlying the plan of creation. It can  thus gradually approach a knowledge of the world that God  himself possessed intuitively , fully, and instantaneously.25  Unlike the ancient atomists, who were persecuted on the  grounds of atheism, and unlike Leibniz, who was sometimes  suspected of denying the existence of grace or of human free­ dom, modern scientists have managed to come up with a  culturally acceptable definition of their enterprise. The human  mind, incorporated in a body subject to the laws of nature,  can, by means of experimental devices, obtain access to the  vantage point from which God himself surveys the world, to  the divine plan of which this world is a tangible expression.  Nevertheless, the mind itself remains outside the results of its  achievement_ The scientist may descr ibe as secondary  qualities, not part of nature but projected onto it by the mind, </p><div id="pagenum"><p>83</p></div><p id="page">51 THE TRIUMPH OF REASON  everything that goes to make up the texture of nature, such as  its perfumes and its colors. The debasement of nature is paral­ lel to the glorification of all that eludes it, God and man.  The Limits of Classical Science  We have tried to describe the unique historical situation in  which scientific practice and metaphysical conviction were  closely coupled. Galileo and those who came after him raised  the same problems as the medieval builders but broke away  from their empirical knowledge to assert, with the help of  God, the simplicity of the world and the universality of the  language the experimental method postulated and deciphered.  In this way, the basic myth underlying modern science can be  seen as a product of the peculiar complex which, at the close  of the Middle Ages, set up conditions of resonance and re­ ciprocal amplification among economic, political, social, re­ ligious, philosophic, and technical factors. However, the rapid  decomposition of this complex left classical science stranded  and isolated in a transformed culture.  Classical science was born in a culture dominated by the  alliance between man, situated midway between the divine  order and the natural order, and God, the rational and intelligi­ ble legislator, the sovereign architect we have conceived in our  own image. It has outlived this moment of cultural consonance  that entitled philosoph ers and theologians to engage in science  and that entitled scientists to decipher and express opinions  on the divine wisdom and power at work in creation. With the  support of religion and philosophy , scientists had come to be­ lieve their enterprise was self-sufficient, that it exhausted the  possibilities of a rational approach to natural phenomena. The  relationship between scientific description and natural phi­ losophy did not, in this sense, have to be justified. It could be  seen as self-evident that science and philosophy were con­ vergent and that science was discovering the principles of an  authentic natural philosophy. But, oddly enough, the self­ sufficiency experienced by scientists was to outlive the departure  of the medieval God and the withdrawal of the epistemological  guarantee offered by theology. The originally bold bet had be­ come the triumphant science of the eighteenth century,26 the </p><div id="pagenum"><p>84</p></div><p id="page">ORDER OUT OF CHAOS 52  science that discovered the laws governing the motion of celes­ tial and earthly bodies, a science that df\lembert and Euler  incorpor ated into a complete and consistent system and  whose history was defined by Lagrange as a logical achieve­ ment tending toward perfection. It was the science honored by  the Academies founded by absolute monarchs such as Louis  XIV, Frederick II, and Catherine the Great,27 the science that  made Newton a national hero. In other words, it was a suc­ cessful science, convinced that it had proved that nature is  transpar ent. "Je n'ai pas besoin de cette hypothese" was  Laplace's reply to Napoleon, who had asked him God's place  in his world system.  The dualist implications of modern science were to survive  as well as its claims. For the science of Laplace which, in  many respects, is still the classical conception of science to­ day, a description is objective to the extent to which the ob­ server is excluded and the description itself is made from a  point lying de jure outside the world, that is, from the divine  viewpoint to which the human soul, created as it was in God's  image, had access at the beginning. Thus classical science still  aims at discovering the unique truth about the world, the one  language that will decipher the whole of nature-today we  would speak of the fundamental level of description from ·  which everything in existence can be deduced.  On this essential point let us cite Einstein, who has trans­ lated into modern terms precisely what we may call the basic  myth underlying modern science:  What place does the theoretical physicist's picture of the  world occupy among all these possible pictures? It de­ mands the highest possible standard of rigorous precision  in the description of relations, such as only the use of  mathematical language can give. In regard to his subject  matter, on the other hand, the physicist has to limit him­ self very severely: he must content himself with describ­ ing the most simple events which can be brought within  the domain of our experience; all events of a more com­ plex order are beyond the power of the human intellect to  reconstruct with the subtle accuracy and logical perf ec­ tion which the theoretical physicist demands. Supreme  purity, clarity, and certainty at the cost of completene ss. </p><div id="pagenum"><p>85</p></div><p id="page">53 THE TRIUMPH OF REASON  But what can be the attraction of getting to know such a  tiny section of nature thoroughly , while one leaves every­ thing subtler and more complex shyly and timidly alone?  Does the product of such a modest effort deserve to be  called by the proud name of a theory of the universe?  In my belief the name is justified; for the general laws  on which the structure of theoretical physics is based  claim to be valid for any natural phenomenon what­ soever. With them, it ought to be possible to arrive at the  description, that is to say, the theory, of every natural  process, including life, by means of pure deduction , if  that process of deduction were not far beyond the capac­ ity of the human intellect. The physicist's renunciation of  completene ss for his cosmos is therefore not a matter of  fundamental principle .2s  For some time there were those who persisted in the illusion  that attraction in the form in which it is expressed in the law of  gravitation would justify attributing an intrinsic animation to  nature and that if it were generalized it would explain the ori­ gins of increasingly specific forms of activity, including even  the interactions that compose human society. But this hope  was rapidly crushed, at least partly as a consequence of the  demands created by the political, economic, and institutional  setting where science developed. We shall not examine this  aspect of the problem, important though it is. Our point here is  to emphasize that this very failure seemed to establish the  consistency of the classical view and to prove that what had  once been an inspiring conviction was a sad truth. In fact, the  only interpretation apparently capable of rivaling this inter­ pretation of science was henceforth the positivistic refusal of  the very project of understanding the world. For exa mple,  Ernst Mach, the influential philosopher-scientist whose ideas  had a great impact on the young Einstein, defined the task of  scientific knowledge as arranging experience in as economica l  an order as possible. Science has no other meani ngful goal  than the simplest and most economical abstract expression of  facts:  Here we have a clue which strips science of all its mys­ tery, and shows us what its power really is. With respect </p><div id="pagenum"><p>86</p></div><p id="page">ORDER OUT OF CHAOS 54  to specific results it yields us nothing that we could not  reach in a sufficiently long time without methods ....  Just as a single human being, restricted wholly to the  fruits of his own labor, could never amass a fortune, but  on the contrary the accumula tion of the labor of many  men in the hands of one is the foundation of wealth and  power, so, also, no knowledge worthy of the name can be  gathered up in a single human mind limited to the span of  a human life and gifted only with finite powers, except by  the most exquisite economy of thought and by the careful  amassment of the economically ordered experience of  thousands of co-workers .29  Thus science is useful because it leads to economy of  thought. There may be some element of truth in such a state­ ment, but does it tell the whole story? How far we have come  from Newton, Leibniz, and the other founders of Western sci­ ence, whose ambition was to provide an intelligible frame to  the physical universe! Here science leads to interesting rules  of action, but no more.  This brings us back to our starting point, to the idea that it is  classical science, consider ed for a certain period of time as  the very symbol of cultural unity, and not science as such that  led to the cultural crisis we have described. Scientists found  themselves reduced to a blind oscilla tion between the thunder­ ings of .. scientific myth" and the silence of "scientific serious­ ness," between affirming the absolute and global nature of  scientific truth and retreating into a conception of scientific  theory as a pragmatic recipe for effective intervention in natu­ ral processes.  As we have already stated, we subscribe to the view that  classical science has now reached its limit. One aspect of this  transformation is the discovery of the limitations of classical  concepts that imply that a knowledge of the world "as it is"  was possible. The omniscien t beings, Laplace's or Maxwell's  demon, or Einstein's God, beings that play such an important  role in scientific reasoning, embody the kinds of extrapolation  physicists thought they were allowed to make. As random­ ness, complexity, and irreversibility enter into physics as ob­ jects of positive knowledge, we are moving away from this  rather naive assumption of a direct connection between our </p><div id="pagenum"><p>87</p></div><p id="page">55 THE TRIUMPH OF REASON  description of the world and the world itself. Objectivity in  theoretical physics takes on a more subtle meaning.  This evolution was forced upon us by unexpected supple­ mental discoveries that have shown that the existence of uni­ versal constants, such as the velocity of light, limit our power  to manipula te nature. (We shall discuss this unexpected situa­ tion in Chapter VII.) As a result, physicists had to introduce  new mathematical tools that make the relation between percep­ tion and interpretation more complex. Whatever reality may  mean, it always corresponds to an active intellectual construc­ tion. The descriptions presented by science can no longer be  disentangled from our questioning activity and therefore can  no longer be attributed to some omniscient being.  On the eve of the Newtonian synthesis, John Donne la­ mented the passing of the Aristotelian cosmos destroyed by  Copernicus:  And new Philosophy calls all in doubt,  The Element of fire is quite put out,  The Sun is lost, and th'earth, and no man's wit  Can well direct him where to look for it.  And freely men confess that this world's spent,  When in the Planets and the Firmament,  They seek so many new, then they see that this  Is crumbled out again to his Atomies  'Tis all in Pieces, all coherence gone.JO  The scattered bricks and stones of our present culture seem,  as in Donne's time, capable of being rebuilt into a new "co­ herence." Classical science, the mythical science of a simple,  passive world, belongs to the past, killed not by philosophical  criticism or empiricist resignation but by the internal develop­ ment of science itself. </p><div id="pagenum"><p>88</p></div><p id="page">I  I </p><div id="pagenum"><p>89</p></div><p id="page">CHAPTER II  THE IDENTIFICATION  OFTHEREAL  Newtons Laws  We shall now take a closer look at the mechanistic world view  as it emerged from the work of Galileo, Newton, and their  successors. We wish to describe its strong points, the aspects  of nature it has succeeded in clarifying, but we also want to  expose its limitations.  ·Ever since Galileo, one of the central problems of physics  has been the description of acceleration. The surprising fea­ ture was that the change undergone by the state of motion of a  body could be formulated in simple mathematical terms. This  seems almost trivial to us today. Still, we should remember  that Chinese science, so successful in many areas, did not pro­ duce a quantitative formulation of the laws of motion. Galileo  discovered that we do not need to ask for the cause of a state  of motion if the motion is uniform, any more than it is neces­ sary to ask the reason for a state of rest. Both motion and rest  remain indefinitely stable unless something happens to upset  them. The central problem is the change from rest to motion,  and from motion to rest, as well as, more generally, all changes  of velocity. How do these changes occur? The formulation of  the Newtonian laws of motion made use of two converging  developments: one in physics, Kepler's laws for planetary mo­ tion and Galileo's laws for falling bodies, and the other in  mathemat ics, the formulation of differential or "infinitesimal"  calculus.  How can a continuously varying speed be defined? How can  we describe the instantaneous changes in the various quan­ tities, such as position, velocity, and acceleration? How can  we describe the state of a body at any given instant? To answer  57 </p><div id="pagenum"><p>90</p></div><p id="page">ORDER OUT OF CHAOS 58  these questions, mathemati cians have introduced the concept  of infinitesimal quantitie s. An infinitesimal quantity is the re­ sult of a limiting process; it is typically the variation in a quan­ tity occurring between two successive instants when the time  elapsing between these instants tends toward zero. In this way  the change is broken up into an infinite series of infinitely  small changes.  At each instant the state of a moving body can be defined by  its position r, by its velocity v, which expresses its "instanta­ neous tendency" to modify this position, and by its accelera­ tion a, again its "instantaneous tendency ," but now to modify  its velocity. Instantaneous velocities and accelerat ions are lim­ iting quantities that measure the ratio between two infinitesi­ mal quantities: the variation of r (or v) during a temporal  interval 6.t, and this interval 6.t when 6.t tends to zero. Such  quantities are "derivatives with respect to time," and since  Leibniz they have been written as v=drldt and a=dv/dt.  Therefore, acceleration, the derivative of a derivative , a= d2r!  dt2, becomes a "second derivative ." The problem on which  Newtonian physics concentrates is the calculation of this sec­ ond derivative , that is, of the acceleration undergone at each  instant by the points that form a system. The motion of each of  these points over a finite interval of time can then be calcu­ lated by integration, by adding up the infinitesimal velocity  changes occurring during this interval. The simplest case is  when a is constant (for example, for a freely falling body a is  the gravitational constant g). Generally speaking, acceleration  itself varies in time, and the physicist's task is to determine  precisely the nature of this variation.  In Newtonian language, to study acceleration means to de­ termine the various "forces" acting on the points in the system  under examinat ion. Newton's second law, F= ma, states that  the force applied at any point is proportional to the accelera­ tion it produces. In the case of a system of material points, the  problem is more complica ted, since the forces acting on a  given body are determined at each instant by the relative dis­ tances between the bodies of the system, and thus vary at each  instant as a result of the motion they themselves produce.  A problem in dynamics is expressed in the form of a set of  "differential .. equations. The instantaneous state of each of  the bodies in a system is described as a point and defined by </p><div id="pagenum"><p>91</p></div><p id="page">59 THE IDENTIF ICATION OF THE REAL  means of its position as well as by its velocity and accelera­ tion, that is, by the first and second derivatives of the position.  At each instant, a set of forces, which is a function of the  distance between the points in the system (a function of r),  gives a precise acceleration to each point; the accelerations  then bring about changes in the distances separating these  points and therefore in the set of forces acting at the following  instant.  While the differential equations set up the dynamics prob­ lem, their "integration" represents the solution of this prob­ lem. It leads to the calculation of the trajectories , r(t). These  trajectories contain all the information acknowledged as rele­ vant by dynamic s; it provides a complete description of the  dynamic system.  The description therefore implies two elements: the posi­ tions and velocities of each of the points at one instant, often  called the "initial instant," and the equations of motion that  relate the dynamic forces to the accelerations. The integration  of the dynamic equations starting from the "initial state" un­ fold the succession of states, that is, the set of trajectories of  its constitutive bodies.  The triumph of Newtonian science is the discovery that a  single force, gravity, determines both the motion of planets  and comets in the sky and the motions of bodies falling toward  the earth. Whatever pair of material bodies is considered, the  Newtonian system implies that they are linked by the same  force of attraction. Newtonian dynamics thus appears to be  doubly universal. The definition of the law of gravity that de­ scribes how masses tend to approach one another contains no  reference to any scale of phenomena. It can be applied equally  well to the motion of atoms, of planets, or of the stars in a  galaxy. Every body, whatever its size, has a mass and acts as a  source of the Newtonian forces of interaction.  Since gravitational forces connect any two bodies (for two  bodies of mass m and m' and separated by a distance r, the  gravitational force is kmm'fr2, where k is the Newtonian force  of attraction equal to 6.67cm3g-1se c-2), the only true dy­ namic system is the universe as a whole. Any local dynamic  system, such as our planetary system, can only be defined  approximately, by neglecting forces that are small in compari­ son to those whose effect is being considered. </p><div id="pagenum"><p>92</p></div><p id="page">ORDER OUT OF CHAOS 60  It must be emphasized that whatever the dynamic system  chosen, the laws of motion can always be expressed in the  form F= ma. Other types of forces apart from those due to  gravity may be discovered (and actually have been discov­ ered-for instance, electric forces of attraction and repulsion)  and would thereby modify the empirical content of the laws of  motion. They would not, however, modify the form of those  laws. In the world of dynamics, change is identified with acceler­ ation or deceleration. The integration of the laws of motion  leads to the trajectories that the particles follow. Therefore the  laws of change, of time's impact on nature, are expressed in  terms of the characteristics of trajectories.  The basic characteristics of trajectories are lawfulness, de­ terminism, and reversibility. We have seen that in order to cal­ culate a trajectory we need, in addition to our knowledge of  the laws of motion, an empirical definition of a single in­ stantaneous state of the system. The general law then deduces  from this "initial state" the series of states the system passes  through as time progresses, just as logic deduces a conclusion  from basic premises. The remarkable feature is that once the  forces are known, any single state is suf ficient to define the  system completely , not only its future but also its past. At  each instant, therefore, everything is given. Dynamics defines  all states as equivalent: each of them allows all the others to be  calculated along with the trajectory which connects all states,  be they in the past or the future.  "Everything is given." This conclusion of classical dynam­ ics, which Bergson repeatedly emphasized, characterizes the  reality that dynamics describes. Everything is given, but ev­ erything is also possible. A being who has the power to control  a dynamic system may calculate the right initial state in such a  way that the system "spontaneously" reaches any chosen  state at some chosen time. The generality of dynamic laws is .  matched by the arbitrariness of the initial conditions.  The reversibility of a dynamic trajectory was explicitly  stated by all the founders of dynamics. For instance, when  Galilee or Huyghens described the implications of the equiv­ alence between cause and effect postu lated as the basis of  their mathematization of motion, they staged thought experi­ ments such as an elastic ball bouncing on the ground. As the </p><div id="pagenum"><p>93</p></div><p id="page">61 THE IDENTIFICATION OF THE REAL  result of its instantaneous velocity inversion, such a body  would return to its initial position. Dynamics assigns this  property of reversibility to all dynamic changes. This early  "thought experiment" illustrates a general mathematical prop­ erty of dynamic equations. The structure of these equations  implies that if the velocities of all the points of a system are  reversed, the system will go "backward in time." The system  would retrace all the states it went through during the previous  change. Dynamics defines as mathematically equivalent  changes such as t-+-t, time inversion, and v-+-v, velocity  reversal. What one dynamic change has achieved, another  change, defined by velocity inversion, can undo, and in this  way exactly restore the original conditions.  This property of reversibility in dynamics leads, however, to  a difficulty whose full significance was realized only with the  introduction of quantum mechanics. Manipula tion and mea­ surement are essentially irreversible. Active science is thus,  by definition, extraneous to the idealized, reversible world it is  describing. From a more general point of view, reversibility  may be taken as the very symbol of the "strange ness" of the  world described by dynamics. Everyone is familiar with the  absurd effects produced by projecting a film backward-the  sight of a match being regenerated by its flame, broken ink  pots that reassemble and return to a tabletop after the ink has  poured back into them, branches that grow young again and  turn into fresh shoots. In the world of classical dynamics, such  events are considered to be just as likely as the normal ones.  We are so accustomed to the laws of classical dynamics that  are taught to us early in school that we often fail to sense the  boldness of the assumptions on which they are based. A world  in which all trajectories are reversible is a strange world in­ deed. Another astonishing assumption is that of the complete  independence of initial conditions from the laws of motion. It  is possible to take a stone and throw it with some initial ve­ locity limited only by one's physical strength, but what about  a complex system SlJCh as a gas formed by many particles? It  is obvious that we can no longer impose arbitrary initial condi­ tions. The initial conditions must be the outcome of the dy­ namic evolution itself. This is an important point to which we  shall come back in the third part of this book. But whatever its </p><div id="pagenum"><p>94</p></div><p id="page">ORDER OUT OF CHAOS 62  limitations, today, three centuries later, we can only admire  the logical coherence and the power of the methods discovered  by the founders of classical dynamics.  Motion and Change  Aristotle made time the measure of change. But he was fully  aware of the qualitative multiplicity of change in nature. Still  there is only one type of change surviving in dynamics, one  "process," and that is motion. The qualitative diversity of  changes in nature is reduced to the study of the relative dis­ placement of material bodies. Time is a parameter in terms of  which these displacements may be described. In this way  space and time are inextricably tied together in the world of  classical dynamics. (Also see Chapter IX.)  It is interesting to compare dynamic change with the atom­ ists' conception of change, which enjoyed consider able favor  at the time Newton formulated his laws. Actually, it seems that  not only Descartes, Gassendi, and d'Alembert, but even New­ ton himself believed that collisions between hard atoms were  the ultimate, and perhaps the only, sources of changes of mo­ tion.t Nevertheless, the dynamic and the atomic descriptions  differ radically. Indeed, the continuous nature of the accelera­ tion described by the dynamic equations is in sharp contrast  with the discontinuous, instantaneous collisions between hard  particles. Newton had already noticed that, in contradiction to  dynamics, an irreversible loss of motion is involved in each  hard collision. The only reversible collision-that is, the only  one in agreement with the laws of dynamics-is the "elastic,"  momentum-conserving collision. But how can the complex  property of "elasticity " be applied to atoms that are supposed  to be the fundamental elements of nature?  On the other hand, at a less technical level, the laws of dy­ namic motion seem to contradict the randomness generally  attributed to collisions between atoms. The ancient philoso­ phers had already pointed out that any natural process can be  interpreted in many different ways in terms of the motion of  and collisions between atoms. This was not a problem for the  atomists, since their main aim was to describe a godless, law-</p><div id="pagenum"><p>95</p></div><p id="page">63 THE IDENTIFICATION OF THE REAL  less world in which man is free and can expect to receive nei­ ther punishment nor reward from any divine or natural order.  But classical science was a science of engineers and astrono­ mers, a science of action and prediction. Speculations based  on hypothetical atoms could not satisfy its needs. In contrast,  Newton's law provided a means of predicting and manipula t­ ing. Nature thus becomes law-abiding, docile, and predict­ able, instead of being chaotic, unruly, and stochastic. But  what is the connection between the mortal, unstable world in  which atoms unceasingly combine and separate, and the im­ mutable world of dynamics governed by Newton's law, a siagle  mathematical formula corresponding to an eternal truth un­ folding toward a tautological fu ture? In the twentieth century  we are again witnessing the clash between lawfulness and ran­ dom events, which, as Koyre has shown, had already tor­ mented Descartes .2 Ever since the end of the nineteenth  century, with the kinetic theory of gases, the atomic chaos has  reintegrated physics, and the problem of the relationship be­ tween dynamic law and statistical description has penetrated  to the very core of physics. It is one of the key elements in the  present renewal of dynamics (see Book III).  In the eighteenth century, however , this contradiction  seemed to produce a deadlock. This may partly explain the  skepticism of some eighteenth-century physicists regarding  the significance of Newton's dynamic descriptio n. We have al­ ready noted that collisions may lead to a loss of motion. They  thereby concluded that in such nonideal cases, "energy" is  not conserved but is irreversibly dissipated (see Chapter IV,  section 3). Therefore, the atomists could not help considering  dynamics as an idealization of limited value. Continental  physicists and mathematicians such as dl\lembert, Clairaut,  and Lagrange resisted the seductive charms of Newtonianism  for a long time.  Where do the roots of the Newtonian concept of change lie?  It appears to be a synthesis3 of the science of ideal machines,  where motion is transmitted without collision or friction be­ tween parts already in contact, and the science of celestial  bodies interacting at a distance. We have seen that it appears  as the very antithesis of atomism, which is based on the con­ cept of random collisions. Does this, however, vindicate the  view of those who believe that Newtonian dynamics repre-</p><div id="pagenum"><p>96</p></div><p id="page">ORDER OUT OF CHAOS 64  sents a rupture in the history of thinking, a revolutionary nov­ elty? This is what positivist historians have claimed when they  described how Newton escaped the spell of preconceived no­ tions and had the courage to infer from the mathematical study of  planetary motions and the laws of falling bodies the action of a  "universal" force. We know that on the contrary the eighteenth­ century rationalists emphasized the apparent similarity be­ tween his "mathematical" forces and traditional occult  qualities. Fortunately, these critics did not know the strange  story behind the Newtonian forces! For behind Newton's cau­ tious declaration-" ! frame no hypotheses"-concerning the  nature of the forces lurked the passion of an alchemist.4 We  now know that, side by side with his mathematical studies,  Newton had studied the ancient alchemists for thirty years  and had carried out painstaking laboratory experiments on  ways of achieving the master work, the synthesis of gold.  Recently some historians have gone so far as to propose that  the Newtonian synthesis of heaven and earth was the achieve­ ment of a chemist, not an astronomer . The Newtonian force  "animating" matter and, in the stronger sense of the term,  making up the very activity of nature would then be the inheri­ tor of the forces Newton the chemist observed and manipu­ lated, the chemical "affinities" forming and disrupting ever  new combinations of matter.s The decisive role played by ce­ lestial orbits of course remains. Still, at the start of his intense  astronomical studies- about 1679-New ton apparently ex­ pected to find new forces of attraction only in the heavens,  forces similar to chemical forces and perhaps easier to study  mathema tically. Six years later this mathematical study pro­ duced an unexpected conclusion: the forces between the plan­ ets and those accelerating freely falling bodies are not merely  similar but are the same. Attraction is not specific to each  planet; it is the same-for the moon circling the earth, for the  planets, and even for comets passing through the solar system.  Newton set out to discover in the sky forces similar to the  chemical forces: the specific affinities, different for each  chemical compound and giving each compound qualitatively  differentiated activities. What he actually found was a univer­ sal law, which, as he emphasized , could be applied to all phe­ nomena-whether chemical, mechanical, or celestial in  nature. </p><div id="pagenum"><p>97</p></div><p id="page">65 THE IDENTIFICATION OF THE REAL  The Newtonian synthesis is thus a surprise. It is an unex­ pected, staggering discovery that the scientific world has com­ memorated by making Newton the symbol of modern science.  What is particularly astonishing is that the basic code of na­ ture appeared to have been cracked in a single creative act.  For a long time this sudden loquaciousness of nature, this  triumph of the English Moses, was a source of intellectual  scandal for continental rationalists. Newton's work was  viewed as a purely empirical discovery that could thus equally  well be empirically disproved. In 1747 Euler, Clairaut, and  d�lembert, without doubt some of the greatest scientists of  the time, came to the same conclusion: Newton was wrong. In  order to describe the moon's motion, a more complex mathe­ matical form must be given to the force of attraction, making it  the sum of two terms. For the following two years, each of  them believed that nature had proved Newton wrong, and this  belief was a source of excitement, not of dismay. Far from con­ sidering Newton's discovery synonymous with physical sci­ ence itself, physicists were blithely contempla ting dropping it  altogether . D�lembert went so far as to express scruples  about seeking fresh evidence against Newton and giving him  "le coup de pied de l'iine."6  Only one courageous voice against this verdict was raised in  France. In 1748, Buffon wrote:  A physical law is a law only by virtue of the fact that it is  easy to measure, and that the s�ale it represents is not  only always the same, but is actually unique .... M.  Clairaut has raised an objection against Newton's sys­ tem, but it is at best an objection and must not and cannot  become a principle; an attempt should be ,made to over­ come it and not to turn it into a theory the entire con­ sequences of which merely rest on a calculation; for, as I  have said, one may repr esent anything by means of cal­ culation and achieve nothing; and if it is allowed to add  one or more terms to a physical law such as that of attrac­ tion, we are only adding to arbitrariness instead of repre­ senting reality. 7  Later Buffon was to announce what was to become, although  for only a short time, the research program for chemistry: </p><div id="pagenum"><p>98</p></div><p id="page">ORDER OUT OF CHAOS 66  The laws of affinity by means of which the constituent  parts of different substances separate from others to  combine together to form homogeneous substances are  the same as the general law governing the reciprocal ac­ tion of all the celestial bodies on one another: they act in  (he same way and with the same ratios of mass and dis­ tance; a globule of water, of sand or metal acts upon an­ other globule just as the terrestrial globe acts on the  moon, and if the laws of affinity have hitherto been re­ garded as different from those of gravity, it is because  they have not been fully understood, not grasped com­ pletely; it is because the whole extent of the problem has  not been taken in. The figure which, in the case of celes­ tial bodies has little or no effect upon the law of interac­ tion betw een bodies because of the great distance  involved, is, on the contrary, all important when the dis­ tance is very small or zero .... Our nephews will be  able, by calculation, to gain access to this new field of  knowledge [that is, to deduce the law of interaction be­ tween elementary bodies from their figures].&  History was to vindicate the naturalist, for whom force was  not mer;ely a mathematical artifice but the very essence of the  new science of nature. The physicists were later compelled to  admit their mistake. Fifty years afterward, Laplace could  write his Systeme du Monde. The law of universal gravity had  stood all tests successf ully: the numerous cases apparently  disproving it had been transformed into a brilliant demonstra­ tion of its validity. At the same time, under Buffon's influence,  the French chemists rediscovered the odd analogy between  physical attraction and chemical affinity.9 Despite the sar­ casms of d/\lembert, Condillac, and Condorcet, whose unbend­ ing rationalism was quite incompatible with these obscure and  barren "analogies," they trod Newton's path in the opposite  direction -from the stars to matter.  By the early nineteenth century, the Newtonian program­ the reduction of all physicochemical phenomena to the action  of forces (in addition to gravitational attraction, this included  the repelling force of heat, which makes bodies expand and  favors dissolution, as well as electric and magnetic forces)­ had become the official program of Laplace's school, which </p><div id="pagenum"><p>99</p></div><p id="page">67 THE IDENTIF ICATION OF THE REAL  dominated the scientific world at the time when Napoleon  dominated Europe. JO  The early nineteenth century saw the rise of the great  French ecoles and the reorganization of the universitie s. This  is the time when scientists became teachers and professional  researchers and took up the ta�k of training their successors .••  It is also the time of the first attempts to present a synthesis of  knowledge, to gather it together in textbooks and works of  popularization. Science was no longer discussed in the salons;  it was taught or popularized.12 It had become a matter of pro­ fessional consensus and magistral authority . The first con­ sensus centered around the Newtonian system: in France  Buffon's confidence finally triumphed over the rational skepti­ cism of the Enlightenment.  One century after Newton's apotheosis in England , the  grandiloquence of these lines written by Ampere's son echoes  that of Pope's epitaph: 13  Announcing the coming of science's Messiah  Kepler had dispelled the clouds around the Arch.  Then the Word was made man, the Word of the seeing  God  Whom Plato revered, and He was called Newton.  He came, he revealed the principle supreme,  Eternal, universal, One and unique as God Himself.  The worlds were hushed, he spoke: ATTRACTION.  This word was the very word of creation .*  For a short time, which nevertheless left an indelible mark,  science was triumphant, acknowled ged and honored by  powerful states and acclaimed as the possessor of a consistent  conception of the world. Worshiped by Laplace, Newton be­ came the universal symbol of this golden age. It was a happy  moment, indeed, a moment in which scientists were regarded  both by themselves and others as the pioneers of progress,  achieving an enterprise sustained and fostered by society as a  whole.  What is the significance of the Newtonian synthesis toda y,  after the advent of field theory, relativity, and quantum me- *Our translation-authors . </p><div id="pagenum"><p>100</p></div><p id="page">ORDER OUT OF CHAOS 68  chanics? This is a complex problem, to which we shall return.  We now know that nature is not always "c omfortable and con­ sonant with herself." At the microscopic level, the laws of  classical mechanics have been replaced by those of quantum  mechanic s. Likewise, at the level of the universe, relativistic  physics has displaced Newtonian physics. Classical physics  nevertheless remains the natural reference point. Moreover, in  the sense that we have defined it-that is, as the description of  deterministic, reversible, static trajectories-N ewtonian dy­ namics still may be said to form the core of physics.  Of course, since Newton the formulation of classical dy­ namics has undergone great changes. This was a result of the  work of some of the greatest mathema ticians and physicists,  such as Hamilton and Poincare. In brief, we may distinguish  two periods. First there was a period of clarification and of  generalization. During the second period, the very concepts  upon which classical dynamics rests, such as initial conditions  and the meaning of trajectories, have undergone a critical revi­ sion even in the fields in which (in contrast to quantum me­ chanics and relativity) classical dynamics remains valid. At  the moment this book is being written, at the end of the twen­ tieth century, we are still in this second period. Let us turn  now to the general language of dynamics that was discovered  by nineteenth-century scientists. (In Chapter IX we shall de­ scribe briefly the revival of classical dynamics in our time.)  The Language of Dynarnics  Today classical dynamics can be formulated in a compact and  elegant way. As we shall see, all the properties of a dynamic  system can be summarized in terms of a single function, the  Hamiltonian. The language of dynamics presents a remarkable  consistency and complet eness. An unambiguous formulation  can be given to each "legitimate" problem. No wonder the  structure of dynamics has both fascinated and terrified the  imagination since the eighteenth century.  In dynamic s,the same system can be studied from different  points of view. In classical dynamics all these points of view  are equivalent in the sense that we can go from one to another  by a transformation, a change of variables. We may speak of </p><div id="pagenum"><p>101</p></div><p id="page">69 THE IDENTIFICATION OF THE REAL  various equivalent representations in which the laws of dy­ namics are valid. These various equivalent representations  form the general language of dynamics. This language can be  used to make explicit the static character classical dynamics  attributes to the systems it describe s: for many classes of dy­ namic systems, time appears merely as an accident, since  their description can be reduced to that of noninteracting me­ chanical systems. To introduce these concepts in a simple way,  let us start with the principle of conservation of energy.  In the ideal world of dynamics, devoid of frictions and colli­ sions, machines have an efficiency of one-the dynamic sys­ tem comprising the machine merely transmits the whole of the  motion it receives. A machine receiving a certain quantity of  potential energy (for example, a compressed spring, a raised  weight, compressed air) can produce a motion corresponding  to an "equal" quantity of kinetic energy, exactly the quantity  that would be needed to restore the potential energy the ma­ chine has used in producing the motion. The simplest case is  that in which the only force considered is gravity (which ap­ plies to simple machines, pulleys, levers, capstans, etc.). In  this case it is easy to establish an overall relationship of equiv­ alence between cause and effect. The height (h) through which  a body falls entirely determines the velocity acquired during  its fall. Whether a body of mass m falls vertically , runs down  an inclined plane, or follows a roller-coaster path, the acquired  velocity (v) and the kinetic ener gy (mv2/2) depend only on the  drop in level h (v = Vfiii) and enable the body to return to its  original height. The work done against the force of gravity im­ plied in this upward motion restores the potential energy, mgh,  that the system lost during the fall. Another example is the  pendulum, in which kinetic energy and potential energy are  continuously transformed into one another.  Of course, if instead of a body falling toward the earth, we  are dealing with a system of interacting bodies, the situation is  less easily visualized. Still, at each instant the global variation  in kinetic energy compensates for the variation in potential  energy (bound to the variation in the distances between the  points in the system). Here also energy is conserved in an iso­ lated system.  Potential energy (or ''potential ," convention ally denoted as  V), which depends on the relative positions of the particles, is </p><div id="pagenum"><p>102</p></div><p id="page">ORDER OUT OF CHAOS 70  thus a generalization of the quantity that enabled builders of  machines to measure the motion a machine could produce as  the result of a change in its spatial configuration (for example,  the change in the height of a mass m, which is part of the  machine, gives it a potential energy mgh). Moreover, potential  energy allows us to calculate the set of forces applied at each  instant to the different points of the system to be described . At  each point the derivative of the potential with respect to the  space coordina te q measures the force applied at this point in  the direction of that coordinate. Newton's laws of motion thus  can be formulated using the potential function instead of force  as the main quantity: the variation in the velocity of a point  mass at each instant (or the momentum p, the product of the  mass and the velocity) is measured by the derivative of the  potential with respect to the coordinate q of the mass.  In the nineteenth century this formulation was generalized  through the introduction of a new function, the Hamiltonian  (H). This function is simply the total energy, the sum of the  system's potential and kinetic energy. However , this ener gy is  no longer expressed in terms of positions and velocities, con­ ventionally denoted by q and dq/dt, but in terms of so-called  canonical variables-coordinates and momenta-for which  the standard notation is q and p. In simple cases, such as with  a free particle, there is a straightforward relation between ve­ locity and momentum (p = m dqldt), but in general the relation  is more complicated.  A single function, the Hamiltonian , H(p, q), describes the  dynamics of a system completely. All our empirical knowledge  is put into the form of H. Once this function is known, we may  solve, at least in principle, all possible problems. For example,  the time variation of the coordinate and of the momenta is  simply given by the derivatives of H in respect top or q. This  Hamiltonian formulation of dynamics is one of the greatest  achievements in the history of science. It has been progres­ sively extended to cover the theory of electricity and magne­ tism. It has also been used in quantum mechanic s. It is true  that in quantum mechanics, as we shall see later, the meaning  of the Hamiltonian H had to be generalized: here it is no  longer a simple function of the coordinates and momenta, but  it becomes a new kind of entity, an operator. (We shall return  to this question in Chapter VII.) In any case, the Hamiltonian </p><div id="pagenum"><p>103</p></div><p id="page">71 THE IDENTIFICATION OF THE REAL  description is still of the greatest importance today. The equa­ tions which, through the derivatives of the Hamiltonian, give  the time variation of the coordinates and momenta are the so­ called canonical equations. They contain the general proper­ ties of all dynamic changes. Here we have the triumph of the  mathematiza tion of nature. All dynamic change to which clas­ sical dynamics applies can be reduced to these simple mathe­ matical equation s.  Using these equation s, we can verify the above-mentioned  general properties implied by classical dynamics. The canoni­ cal equations are reversible: time inversion is mathematically  the equivalent of velocity inversion . They are also conserva­ tive: the Hamiltonian, which expressed the system's energy in  the canonical variables-coordinates and momenta-is itself  conserved by the changes it brings about in the course of time.  We have already noticed that there exist many points of view  or "representations" in which the Hamiltonian form of the  equations of motion is maintained. They correspond to various  choices of coordinates and momenta. One of the basic prob­ lems of dynamics is to examine precisely how we can select  the pair of canonical variables q and p to obtain as simple a  description of dynamics as possible. For example, we could  look for canonical variables by which the Hamiltonian is re­ duced to kinetic energy and depends only on the momenta  (and not on the coordinates). What is remarkab le is that in this  case momenta become constants of motion. Indeed, as we  have seen, the time variation of the momenta depends, accord­ ing to the canonical equation, on the derivative of the Hamilto­ nian in respect to the coordina tes. When this derivative  vanishes, the momenta indeed become constants of motion.  This is similar to what happens in a "free particle" system.  What we have done when we go to a free particle system is  "eliminate" the interaction through a change of representa­ tion. We will define systems for which this is possible as "inte­ grable systems." Any integrable system may thus be  represented as a set of units, each changing in isolation, quite  independently of all the others, in that eternal and immutable  motion Aristotle attributed to the heavenly bodies (Figure 1).  We have already noted that in dynamics "everything is  given." Here this means that, from the very first instant, the  value of the various invariants of the motion is fixed; nothing </p><div id="pagenum"><p>104</p></div><p id="page">(a) ORDER OUT OF CHAOS 72  •  >  • •  •  •  •  •  (b)  Figure 1.

Here we reach one of those  dramatic moments in the history of science when the descrip­ tion of nature was nearly reduced to a static picture. Indeed,  through a clever change of variables, all interaction could be  made to disappear. It was believed that integrable systems,  reducible to free particles, were the prototype of dynamic sys­ tems. Generations of physicists and mathematicians tried hard  to find for each kind of systems the "right" variables that  would eliminate the interactions. One widely studied example  was the three-body problem, perhaps the most important  problem in the history of dynamic s. The moon's motion, influ­ enced by both the earth and the sun, is one instance of this  problem. Countless attempts were made to express it in the  form of an integrable system until, at the end of the nineteenth  century, Bruns and Poincare showed that this was impossible.  This came as a surprise and, in fact, announced the end of all  simple extrapolations of dynamics based on integrable sys­ tems. The discovery of Bruns and Poincare shows that dy­ namic systems are not isomorphic. Simple, integrable systems  can indeed be reduced to noninteracting units, but in general,  interacti ons cannot be eliminated. Although this discovery  was not clearly understood at the time, it implied the demise of  the conviction that the dynamic world is homogeneo us, re­ ducible to the concept of integrable systems. Nature as an </p><div id="pagenum"><p>105</p></div><p id="page">73 THE IDENTIFI CATION OF THE REAL  evolving, interactive multiplicity thus resisted its reduction to  a timeless and universal scheme.  There were other indications pointing in the same direction.  We have mentioned that trajectories correspond to determinis­ tic laws; once an initial state is given, the dynamic laws of mo­ tion permit the calculation of trajectories at each point in the  future or the past. However, a trajectory may become intrin­ sically indeterminate at certain singular points. For instance, a  rigid pendulum may display two qualitatively different types of  behavior-it may either oscillate or swing around its points of  suspension. If the initial push is just enough to bring it into a  vertical position with zero velocity, the direction in which it  will fall, and therefore the nature of its motion, are indetermi­ nate. An infinitesimal perturbation would be enough to set it  rotating or oscillating. (This problem of the "instability" of  motion will be discussed fully in Chapter IX.)  It is significant that Maxwell had already stressed the impor­ tance of these singular points. After describing the explosion  of gun cotton, he goes on to say:  In all such cases there is one common circumstance­ the system has a quantity of potential energy, which is  capable of being transformed into motion, but which can­ not begin to be so transformed till the system has reached  a certain configura tion, to attain which requires an expendi­ ture of work, which in certain cases may be infinitesimally  small, and in general bears no definite proportion to the  energy developed in consequence thereof. For example,  the rock loosed by frost and balanced on a singular point  of the mountain-side, the little spark which kindles the  great forest, the little word which sets the world a fight­ ing, the little scruple which prevents a man from doing his  will, the little spor e which blights all the potatoes, the  little gemmule which makes us philosophers or idiots.  Every existence above a certain rank has its singular  points: the higher the rank, the more of them. At these  points, influences whose physical magnitude is too small  to be taken account of by a finite being, may produce  results of the greatest importance. All great results pro­ duced by human endeavour depend on taking advantage  of these singular states when they occur.I4 </p><div id="pagenum"><p>106</p></div><p id="page">ORDER OUT OF CHAOS 74  This conception received no further elaboration owing to the  absence of suitable mathematical techniques for identifying  systems containing such singular points and the absence of the  chemical and biological knowledge that today affords, as we  shall see later, a deeper insight into the truly essential role  played by such singular points.  Be that as it may, from the time of Leibniz' monads (see the  conclusion to section 4) down to the present day (for example,  the stationary states of the electrons in the Bohr model-see  Chapter VII), integrable systems have been the model par ex­ cellence of dynamic systems, and physicists have attempted to  extend the properties of what is actually a very special class of  Hamiltonian equations to cover all natural processes. This is  quite understandable. The class of integrable systems is the  only one that, until recently, had been thoroughly explored.  Moreover, there is the fascination always associated with a  closed system capable of posing all problems, provided it does  not define them as meaningless. Dynamics is such a language ;  being complete, it is by definition coextensive with the world  it is describing. It assumes that all problems, whether simple  or complex, resemble one another since it can always pose  them in the same general form. Thus the temptation to con­ clude that all problems resemble one another from the point of  view of their solutions as well, and that nothing new can ap­ pear as a result of the greater or lesser complexity of the inte­ gration procedure. It is this intrinsic homogeneity that we now  know to be false. Moreover, the mechanical world view was  acceptable as long as all observables referred in one way or  another to motion. This is no longer the case. For example ,  unstable particles have an energy that can be related to motion  but that also has a lifetime that is a quite different type of ob­ servable, more closely related to irreversible processes, as we  shall describe them in Chapters IV and V. The necessity of  introducing new observables into the theoretical sciences was,  and still is today, one of the driving forces that move us beyond  the mechanical world vi ew. </p><div id="pagenum"><p>107</p></div><p id="page">75 THE IDENTIFIC ATION OF THE REAL  Laplaces Demon  Extrapolations from the dynamic description discussed above  have a symbol-the demon imagined by Laplace, capable at  any given instant of observing the position and velocity of  each mass that forms part of the universe and of inferring its  evolution, both toward the past and toward the future. Of  course, no one has ever dreamed that a physicist might one  day benefit from the knowledge possessed by Laplace's de­ mon. Laplace himself only used this fiction to demonstrate the  extent of our ignorance and the need for a statistical descrip­ tion of certain processes. The problematics of Laplace's de­ mon are not related to the question of whether a deterministic  prediction of the course of events is actually possible , but  whether it is possible in principle, de jure. This possibility  seems to be implied in mechanistic description, with its  characteristic duality based on dynamic law and initial condi­ tions.  Indeed, the fact that a dynamic system is governed by a  deterministic law, even though in practice our ignorance of the  initial state precludes any possibility of deterministic predic­ tions, allows the "objective truth" of the system as it would be  seen by Laplace's demon to be distinguished from empirical  limitations due to our ignorance. In the context of classical  dynamics, a deterministic description may be unattainable in  practice; nevertheless, it stands as a limit that defines a series  of increasingly accurate descripti ons.  It is precisely the consistency of this duality formed by dy­ namic law and initial conditions that is challenged in the re­ vival of classical mechanics, which we will describe in Chapter  IX. We shall see that the motion may become so complex, the  trajectories so varied, that no observation, whatever its preci­ sion, can lead us to the determination of the exact initial condi­ tions. But at that point the duality on which classical mechanics  was constructed breaks down. We can predict only the average  behavior of bundles of trajectories.  Modern science was born out of the breakdown of the ani­ mistic alliance with nature . Man seemed to possess a place in  the Aristotelian world as both a living and a knowing creature. </p><div id="pagenum"><p>108</p></div><p id="page">ORDER OUT OF CHAOS 76  The world was made to his measure. The first experimental  dialogue received part of its social and philosophic justifica­ tion from another alliance, this time with the rational God of  Christianity . To the extent to which dynamics has become and  still is the model of science, certain implications of this histor­ ical situation have persisted to our day.  Science is still the prophetic announcement of a description  of the world seen from a divine or demonic point of view. It is  the science of Newton, the new Moses to whom the truth of  the world was unveiled; it is a revealed science that seems  alien to any social and historical context identifying it as the  result of the activity of human society. This type of inspired  discourse is found throughout the history of physics. It has ac­ companie d each conceptual innovation, each occasion at  which physics seemed at the point of unification and the pru­ dent mask of positivism was dropped. Each time physicists  repeated what Ampere's son stated so explicitly: this word­ universal attraction, energy, field theory, or elementary parti­ cles-is the word of creation. Each time-in Laplace's time,  at the end of the nineteenth century, or even today-physicists  announced that physics was a closed book or about to become  so. There was only one final stronghold where nature con­ tinued to resist, the fall of which would leave it defenseless,  conquered, and subdued by our knowledge. They were thus  unwittingly repeating the ritual of the ancient faith. They were  announcing the coming of the new Moses, and with him a new  Messianic period in science.  Some might wish to disregard this prophetic claim, this  somewha t naive enthusia sm, and it is certainly true that di­ alogue with nature has gone on all the same, together with a  search for new theoretical language s, new questions, and new  answers. But we do not accept a rigid separation between the  scientist's "actual" work and the way he judges, interprets,  and orientates this work. To accept it would be to reduce sci­ ence to an ahistorical accumulation of results and to pay no  attention to what scientists are looking for, the ideal knowl­ edge they try to attain, the reasons why they occasionally  quarrel or remain unable to communic ate with each other.ts  Once again, it was Einstein who formulated the enigma pro­ duced by the myth of modern science. He has stated that the  miracle, the only truly astonishing feature, is that science ex-</p><div id="pagenum"><p>109</p></div><p id="page">77 THE IDENTIFIC ATION OF THE REAL  ists at all, that we find a convergence between nature and the  human mind. Similarly, when, at the end of the nineteenth  century, du Bois Reymond made Laplace's demon the very  incarnation of the logic of modern science, he added, "Igno­ ramus, ignorabimus": we shall always be totally ignorant of  the relationship between the world of science and the mind  which knows, perceives, and creates this science.I6  Nature speaks with a thousand voices, and we have only be­ gun to listen. Nevertheless, for nearly two centuries Laplace's  demon has plagued our imaginatio n, bringing a nightmare in  which all things are insignificant. If it were really true that the  world is such that a demon-a being that is, after all, like us,  possessing the same science, but endowed with sharper  senses and greater powers of calculation-cou ld, starting from  the observation of an instantaneous state, calculate its future  and past, if nothing qualitatively differentiates the simple sys­ tems we can describe from the more complex ones for which a  demon is needed, then the world is nothing but an immense  tautology. This is the challenge of the science we have inher­ ited from our prede cessors, the spell we have to exorcise to­ day. </p><div id="pagenum"><p>110</p></div><p id="page">I  I I  I I  I I  I I  I I  I I  I </p><div id="pagenum"><p>111</p></div><p id="page">CHAPTER Ill  THE TWO CULTURES  Diderot and the Discourse of the Living  In his interesting book on the history of the idea of progress,  Nisbet writes:  No single idea has been more important than, perhaps as  important as , the idea of progress in Western civilization  for nearly three thousand years.•  There has been no stronger support for the idea of progress  than the accumulation of knowledge . The grandiose spectacle  of this gradual increase of knowledge is indeed a magnificent  example of a successful collective human endeavor.  Let us recall the remarkable discoveries achieved at the end  of the eighteenth century and the beginning of the nineteenth  century: the theories of heat, electricity , magnetism, and op­ tics. It is not surprising that the idea of scientific progress,  already clearly formulated in the eighteenth century, domi­ nated the nineteenth . Still, as we have pointed out, the posi­ tion of science in Western culture remained unstable. This  lends a dramatic aspect to the history of ideas from the high  point of the Enlightenment.  We have already stated the alternative: to accept science  with what appears to be its alienating conclusions or to turn to  an antiscientific metaphysics. We have also emphasized the  solitude felt by modern men, the loneliness described by Pas­ cal, Kierkegaard , or Monod. We have mentioned the anti­ scientific implications of Heidegger's metaphysics. Now we  wish to discuss more fully some aspects of the intellectual his­ tory of the West, from Diderot, Kant, and Hegel to Whitehead  and Bergson; all of them attempted to analyze and limit the  scope of modern science as well as to open new perspectives  79 </p><div id="pagenum"><p>112</p></div><p id="page">ORDER OUT OF CHAOS 80  seen as radically alien to that science. Today it is usually  agreed that those attempts have for the most part failed. Few  would accept, for example, Kant's division of the world into  phenomenal and noumenal spheres, or Bergson's "intuition"  as an alternative path to a knowledge whose significance  would parallel that of science. Still these attempts are part of  our heritage. The history of ideas cannot be understood with­ out reference to them.  We shall also briefly discuss scientific positivism, which is  based on the separation of what is true from what is scientifi­ cally useful. At the outset this positivistic view may seem to op­ pose clearly the metaphysical views we have mentioned, views  that I. Berlin des cribed as the "Counter-Enlightenment."  However, their fundamental conclusion is the same: we must  reject science as a basis for true knowledge even if at the same  time we recognize its practical importance or we deny, as posi­ tivists do, the possibility of any other cognitive enterprise.  We must remember all these developments to understand  what is at stake� To what extent is science a basis for the intel­ ligibility of nature, including man? What is the meaning of the  idea of progress today?  Diderot, one of the towering figures of the Enlightenment, is  certainly no representative of antiscientific thought. On the  contrary, his confidence in science, in the possibilities of  knowledge, was total. Yet this is the very reason why science  had, following Diderot, to understand life before it could hope  to achieve any coherent vision of nature.  We have already mentioned that the birth of modern science  was marked by the abandonment of vitalist inspiration and, in  particular, of Aristotelian final causes. However, the issue of  the organization of living matter remained and became a chal­ lenge for classical science. Diderot, at the height of the Newto­ nian triumph, emphasizes that this problem was repressed by  physics. He imagines it as haunting the dreams of physicists  who cannot conceive of it while they are awake. The physicist  d /\lembert is dreaming:  ·� living point ... No, that's wrong. Nothing at all to  begin with, and then a living point. This living point is  joined by another , and then another, and from these suc­ cessive joinings there results a unified being, for I am a </p><div id="pagenum"><p>113</p></div><p id="page">81 THE TWO CULTURES  unity, of that I am certain. . . . (As he said this he felt  himself all over.) But how did this unity come about?"  "Now listen, Mr. Philosopher, I can understand an aggre­ gate, a tissue of tiny sensitive bodies, but an animal! ...  A whole, a system that is a unit, an individual conscious  of its own unity! I can't see it, no, I can't see it. "2  In an imaginary conversation with dj\lembert, Oiderot speaks  in the first person, demonstrating the inadequacy of mechanis­ tic explanation:  Look at this egg: with it you can overthrow all the schools  of theology and all the churches in the world. What is this  egg? An insensitive mass before the germ is put into  it ... How does this mass evolve into a new organiza­ tion, into sensitiv ity, into life? Through heat. What will  generate heat in it? Motion. What will the successive  effects of motion be? Instead of answering me, sit down  and let us follow out these effects with our eyes from one  moment to the next. First there is a speck which moves  about, a thread growing and taking colour, flesh being  formed, a beak, wing-tips, eyes, feet coming into view, a  yellowish substance which unwinds and turns into intes­ tines-and you have a living creature .... Now the wall  is breached and the bird emerges, walks, flies, feels pain,  runs away, comes back again, complains, suffers, loves,  desires, enjoys, it experiences all your affections and  does all the things you do. And will you maintain, with  Descartes, that it is an imitating machine pure and sim­ ple? Why, even little children will laugh at you, and phi­ losophers will answer that if it is a machine you are one  too! If, however , you admit that the only difference be­ tween you and an animal is one of organization, you will  be showing sense and reason and be acting in good faith;  but then it will be concluded, contrary to what you had  said, that from an inert substance arranged in a certain  way and impregnated by another inert substance, sub­ jected to heat and motion, you will get sensitivity , life,  memory , consciousness, passions, thought ... Just lis­ ten to your own arguments and you will feel how pitiful </p><div id="pagenum"><p>114</p></div><p id="page">ORDER OUT OF CHAOS 82  they are. You will come to feel that by refusing to enter­ tain a simple hypothesis that explains everything-sen­ sitivity as a property common to all matter or as a result  of the organization of matter-you are flying in the face of  common sense and plunging into a chasm of mysteries,  contradictions and absurdities.3  In opposition to rational mechanics, to the claim that mate­ rial nature is nothing but inert mass and motion, Diderot ap­ peals to one of physics' most ancient sources of inspiration,  namely , the growth, differentiation, and organization of the  embryo. Flesh forms, and so does the beak, the eyes, and the  intestines; a gradual organization occurs in biological "space,"  out of an apparently homogeneous environment differentiated  forms appear at exactly the right time and place through the  effects of complex and coordinated processes.  How can an inert mass, even a Newtonian mass animated  by the forces of gravitational interaction, be the starting point  for organized active local structures? We have seen that the  Newtonian system is a world system: no local configuration of  ·bodies can claim a particular identity; none is more than a  contingent proximity between bodies connected by general re­ lations.  But Diderot does not despair . Science is only beginning; ra­ tional mechanics is merely a first, overly abstract attempt. The  spectacle of the embryo is enough to refute its claims to uni­ versalit y. This is why Diderot compares the work of great  "mathematicians" such as Euler, Bernoulli, and di\lembert to  the pyramids of the Egyptians , awe-inspiring witnesses to the  genius of their builders, now lifeless ruins, alone and forlorn.  True science, alive and fruitful, will be carried on elsewhere."  Moreover, it seems to him that this new science of organized  living matter has already begun. His friend d'Holbach is busy  studying chemistry , Diderot himself has chosen medicine. The  problem in chemistry as well as in medicine is to replace inert  matter with active matter capable of organizing itself and pro­ ducing living beings. Diderot claims that matter has to be sen­ sitive. Even a stone has sensation in the sense that the  molecules of which it is composed actively seek certain com­ binations rather than others and thus are governed their likes  and dislikes. The sensitivity of the whole organism is then </p><div id="pagenum"><p>115</p></div><p id="page">83 THE TWO CULTURES  simply the sum of that of its parts, just as a swarm of bees with  its globally coherent behavior is the result of interactions be­ tween one bee and another; and, Diderot thereby concludes,  the human soul does not exist any more than the soul of the  beehive does.s  Diderot's vitalist protest against physics and the universal  laws of motion thus stems from his rejection of any form of  spiritualist dualism. Nature must be described in such a way  that man's very existence becomes understandable. Other­ wise, and this is what happens in the mechanistic world view,  the scientific description of nature will have its counterpart in  man as an automaton endowed with a soul and thereby alien to  nature.  The twofold basis of materialistic naturalism, at once chemi­ cal and medical, that Diderot employed to counter the physics  of his time is recurrent in the eighteenth century . While biolo­ gists speculated about the animal-machine, the preexistence of  germs, and the chain of living creatures-all problems close to  theology6-chemists and physicians had to face directly the  complexity of real processes in both chemistry and life. Chem­ istry and medicine were, in the late eighteenth century , priv­ ileged sciences for those who fought against the physicists'  esprit de systeme in favor of a science that would take into  account the diversity of natural processes. A physicist could  be pure esprit, a precocious child, but a physician or a chemist  must be a man of experience: he must be able to decipher the  signs, to spot the clues. In this sense, chemistry and medicine  are arts. They demand judgment, application, and tenacious  observation. Chemistr y is a madman's passion, Venel con­ cluded in the article he wrote for Diderot's Encyclopedie, an  eloquent defense of chemistry against the abstract imperialism  of the Newtonians.7 To emphasize the fact that protests raised  by chemists and physicians against the way physicists reduced  living processes to peaceful mechanisms and the quiet unfold­ ing of universal laws were common in Diderot's day, we invoke  the eminent figure of Stahl, the father of vitalism and inventor  of the first consistent chemical systematics.  According to Stahl, universal laws apply to the living only in  the sense that these laws condemn them to death and corrup­ tion; the matter of which living beings are composed is so frail,  so easily decomposed, that if it were governed solely by the </p><div id="pagenum"><p>116</p></div><p id="page">ORDER OUT OF CHAOS 84  common laws of matter, it would not withstand decay or dis­ solution for a moment. If a living creature is to survive in spite  of the general laws of physics, however short its life when it is  compared to that of a stone or another inanimate object, it has  to possess in itself a "principle of conservation" that main­ tains the harmonious equilibrium of the texture and structure  of its body. The astonishing longevity of a living body in view  of the extreme corruptibility of its constitutive matter is thus  indicative of the action of a "natural, permanent, immanent  principle," of a particular cause that is alien to the laws of  inanimate matter and that constantly struggles against the con­ stantly active corruption whose inevitability these laws imply. s  To us this analysis of life sounds both near and remote. It is  close to us in its acute awareness of the singularity and the pre­ cariousness of life. It is remote because, like Aristotle, Stahl  defined life in static terms, in terms of conservation, not of  becoming or evolution. Still, the terminology used by Stahl  can be found in recent biological literature, for example,  where we read that enzymes "combat" decay and allow the  body to ward off the death to which it is inexorably doomed by  physics. Here also, biological organization defies the laws of  nature, and the only "normal" trend is that which leads to  death (see Chapter V).  Indeed, Stahl's vitalism is relevant as long as the laws of  physics are identified with evolution toward decay and disor­ ganization. Today the "vitalist principle" has been superseded  by the succession of improbable mutations preserved in the  genetic message "governing" the living structure. Nonethe­ less, some extrapolations starting from molecular biology rele­ gate life to the confines of nature-that is, conclude life is  compatible with the basic laws of physics but purely contin­ gent. This was explicitly stated by Monod: life does not "fol­ low from the laws of physics, it is compatible with them. Life  is an event whose singularity we have to recognize. "  But the transition from matter to life can also be viewed in a  different way. As we shall see, far from equilibrium, new self­ organizational processes arise. (These questions will be stud­ ied in detail in Chapters V and VI.) In this way biological  organization begins to appear as a natural process.  However , long before these recent developments, the prob­ lematics of life had been transformed. In a politically trans-</p><div id="pagenum"><p>117</p></div><p id="page">85 THE TWO CULTURES  formed Europe the intellectual landscape was remodeled as  the Romantic movement, closely linked with the Counter­ Enlightenment, shows.  Stahl criticized the metaphor of the automaton because, un­ like a living being, the purpose of an automaton does not lie  within itself; its organization is imposed upon it by its maker.  Diderot, far from situating the study of life outside the reach of  science, saw it as representing the future of a science he con­ sidered to be still in its infancy . A few years later, such points  of view were to be challenged.9 Mechanical change, activity as  described by the laws of motion, had now become syn­ onymous with the artificial and with death. Opposed to it,  united in a complex with which we are now quite familiar, were  the concepts of life, spontanei ty, freedom, and spirit. This op­ position was paralleled by the opposition between calculation  and manipulation on the one hand, and the free speculative  activity of the mind on the other. Through speculation the phi­ losopher would reach the spiritual activity at the core of na­ ture. As for the scientist, his concern with nature would be  reduced to taking it as a set of manipulable and measurable  objects; he would thus be able to take possession of nature, to  dominate and control it but not understand it. Thus the intel­ ligibility of nature would lie beyond the grasp of science.  We are not concerned here with the history of philosophy  but merely with emphasizing the extent to which the philo­ sophical criticism of science had at this time become harsher ,  resembling certain modern forms of antiscience. It was no  longer a question of refuting rather naive and shortsighted  generalizations that only have to be repeated aloud-to use  Diderot's language-to make even children laugh, but of refut­ ing the type of approach that produced experimental and  mathematical knowledge of nature. Scientific knowledge is not  being criticized for its limitations but for its nature, and a rival  knowledge, based on another approach, is being announ ced.  Knowledge is fragmented into two opposed modes of inquiry.  From a philosophical point of view, the transition from Di­ derot to the Romantics and, more precisely , from one of these  two types of critical attitudes toward science to the other, can  be found in Kant's transcendental philosophy , the essential  point being that the Kantian critique identified science in gen­ eral with its Newtonian realization. It thereby branded as im-</p><div id="pagenum"><p>118</p></div><p id="page">ORDER OUT OF CHAOS 86  possible any opposition to classical science that was not an  opposition to science itself. Any criticism against Newtonian  physics must then be seen as aimed at downgrading the ra­ tional understanding of nature in favor of a different form of  knowledge. Kant's approach had immense repercussio ns,  which continue down to our day. Let us therefore summarize  his point of view as presented in Critique of Pure Reason,  which, in opposition to the progressist views of the Enlighten­ ment, presents the closed and limiting conception of science  we have just defined.  Kants Critical Ratification  How to restore order in the intellectual landscape left in disar­ ray with the disappearance of God conceived as the rational  principle that links science and nature? How could scientists  ever have access to global truth when it could no longer be  asserted, except metaphorical ly, that science deciphers the  word of creation? God was now silent or at least no longer  spoke the same language as human reason. Moreover, in ana­ ture from which time was eliminated, what remained of our  subjective experience? What was the meaning of freedom,  destiny , or ethical values?  Kant argued that there were two levels of reality: a phenom­ enal level that corresp onds to science, and a noumenal level  corresponding to ethics. The phenomenal order is created by  the human mind. The noumenal level transcends man's intel­ lect; it corresponds to a spiritual reality that supports his ethi­ cal and religious life. In a way, Kant's solution is the only one  possible for those who assert both the reality of ethics and the  reality of the objective world as it is expressed by classical  science. Instead of God, it is now man himself who is the  source of the order he perceives in nature. Kant justifies both  scientific knowledge and man's alienation from the phenom­ enal world described by science. From this perspective we can  see that Kantian philosophy explicitly spells out the philo­ sophical content of classical science.  Kant defines the subject of critical philosophy as transcen­ dental. It is not concerned with the objects of experience but  is based on the a priori fact that a systematic knowledge of </p><div id="pagenum"><p>119</p></div><p id="page">87 THE TWO CULTURES  these objects is possible (this is for him proved by the exis­ tence of physics), going on to state the a priori conditions of  possibility for this mode of knowledge.  To do so a distinction must be made between the direct sen­ sations we receive from the outside world and the objective,  "rational" mode of knowledge. Objective knowledge is not  passive; it forms its objects. When we take a phenomenon as  the object of experience, we assume a priori before we actually  experience it that it obeys a given set of principles. Insofar as it  is perceived as a possible object of knowledge, it is the prod­ uct of our mind's synthetic activity. We find ourselves in the  objects of our knowledge, and the scientist himself is thus the  source of the universal laws he discovers in nature.  The a priori conditions of experience are also the conditions  for the existence of the objects of experience. This celebrated  statement sums up the "Copernican revolution" achieved by  Kant's "transcendental" inquiry. The subject no longer "re­ volves" around its object, seeking to discover the laws by  which it is governed or the language by which it may be de­ ciphered. Now the subject itself is at the center, imposing its  laws, and the world perceived speaks the language of that sub­ ject. No wonder , then, that Newtonian science is able to de­ scribe the world from an external, almost divine point of view!  That all perceived phenomena are governed by the laws of  our mind does not mean that a concrete knowledge of these  objects is useless. According to Kant, science does not engage  in a dialogue with nature but imposes its own language upon it.  Still it must discover , in each case, the specific message ex­ pressed in this general language. A knowledge of the a priori  concepts alone is vain and empty.  From the Kantian point of view Laplace's demon, the sym­ bol of the scientific myth, is an illusion, but it is a rational  illusion. Although it is the result of a limiting process and, as  such, illegitimate, it is still the expression of a legitimate con­ viction that is the driving force of science-the conviction  that, in its entirety , nature is rightfully subjected to the laws  that scientists succeed in deciphering. Wherever it goes, what­ ever it questions, science will always obtain, if not the same  answer, at least the same kind of answer. There exists a single  universal syntax that includes all possible answers.  Transcendental philoso phy thus ratified the physicist's </p><div id="pagenum"><p>120</p></div><p id="page">ORDER OUT OF CHAOS 88  claim to have found the definitive form of all positive knowl­ edge. At the same time, however , it secured for philosophy a  dominant position in. respect to science. It was no longer nec­ essary to look for the philosophic significance of the results of  scientific activity . From the transcendental standpoint, those  results cannot lead to anything really new. It is science, not its  results, that is the subject of philosophy; science taken as a  repetitive and closed enterprise provides a stable foundation  for transcendental reflection.  Therefore, while it ratifies all the claims of science, Kant's  critical philosophy actually limits scientific activity to prob­ lems that can be considered both easy and futile. It condemns  science to the tedious task of deciphering the monotonous lan­ guage of phenomena while keeping for itself questions of hu­ man "destiny": what man may know, what he must do, what  he may hope for. The world studied by science, the world acces­ sible to positive knowledge is "only" the world of phenomena.  Not only is the scientist unable to know things in themselves,  but even the questions he asks are irrelevant to the real prob­ lems of mankind. Beauty, freedom, and ethics cannot be ob­ jects of positive knowledge. They belong to the noumenal  world, which is the domain of philosop hy, and they are quite  unrelated to the phenomenal world.  We can accept Kant's starting point, his emphasis on the  active role man plays in scientific description. Much has al­ ready been said about experimentation as the art of choosing  situations that are hypothetically governed by the law under  investigation and staging them to give clear, experimental an­ swers. For each experiment certain principles are presup­ posed and thus cannot be established by that experiment.  However, as we have seen, Kant goes much further. He denies  the diversity of possible scientific points of view, the diversity  of presupposed principles. In agreement with the myth of clas­ sical science, Kant is after the unique language that science  deciphers in nature, the unique set of a priori principles on  which physics is based and that are thus to be identified with  the categories of human understanding. Thus Kant denies the  need for the scientist's active choice, the need for a selection  of a problematic situation corresponding to a particular theo­ retical language in which definite questions may be asked and  experimental answers sought. </p><div id="pagenum"><p>121</p></div><p id="page">89 THE TWO CULTURES  Kant's critical ratification defines scientific endeavor as  silent and systematic, closed within itself. By so doing, phi­ losophy endorses and perpetuates the rift, debasing and sur­ rendering the whole field of positive knowledge to science  while retaining for itself the field of freedom and ethics, con­ ceived as alien to nature.  A Prlilosophy of Nature? Hegel and Bergson  The Kantian truce between science and philosophy was a frag­ ile one. Post-Ka ntian philosophers disrupted this truce in favor of  a new philosophy of science, presupposing a new path to knowl­ edge that was distinct from science and actually hostile to it.  Speculation released from the constraints of any experimental  dialogue reigned supreme, with disastrous consequences for  the dialogue between scientists and philosophers. For most  scientists, the philosophy of nature became synonymous with  arrogant, absurd speculation riding roughshod over facts, and  indeed regularly proven wrong by the facts. On the other side,  for most philosophers it has become a symbol of the dangers  involved in dealing with nature and in competing with science.  The rift among science, philosophy, and humanistic studies  was thus made greater by mutual disdain and fear.  As an example of this speculative approach to nature, let us  first consider Hegel. Hegel's philosophy has cosmic dimen­ sions. In his system increasing levels of complexity are spec­ ified, and nature's purpose is the eventual self-realization of its  spiritual element. Nature's history is fulfilled with the appear­ ance of man-that is, with the coming of Spirit apprehending  itself.  The Hegelian philosophy of nature systematically incorpo­ rates all that is denied by Newtonian science. In particular, it  rests on the qualitative difference between the simple behavior  described by mechanics and the behavior of more complex en­ tities such as living beings. It denies the possibility of reducing  those levels, rejecting the idea that differences are merely ap­ parent and that nature is basically homogeneous and simple. It  affirms the existence of a hierarchy, each level of which pre­ supposes the preceding ones. </p><div id="pagenum"><p>122</p></div><p id="page">ORDER OUT OF CHAOS 90  Unlike the Newtonian authors of romans de Ia matiere, of  world-embracing panoramas ranging from gravitational inter­ actions to human passions, Hegel knew perfectly well that his  distinctions among levels (which, quite apart from his own in­ terpretation, we may acknowledge as corresponding to the  idea of an increasing complexity in nature and to a concept of  time whose significance would be richer on each new level)  ran counter to his day's mathematical science of nature. He  therefore set out to limit the significance of this science, to  show that mathematical description is restricted to the most  trivial situations. Mechanics can be mathematized because it  attributes only space-time properties to matter. ·� brick does  not kill a man merely because it is a brick, but solely because  of its acquired velocity; this means that the man is killed tzy  space and time." IO The man is killed by what we call kinetic  energy (mv2/2)-by an abstract quantity defining mass and ve­ locity as interchangeable; the same murderous effect can be  achieved by reducing one and increasing the other.  It is precisely this interchangeability that Hegel sets as a  condition for mathematization that is no longer satisfied when  the mechanical level of description is abandoned for a "higher"  one involving a larger spectrum of physical properties.  In a sense Hegel's system provides a consistent philosophic  response to the crucial problems of time and complexity .  However , for generations of scientists it represented the epit­ ome of abhorrence and contempt. In a few years, the intrinsic  difficulties of Hegel's philosophy of nature were aggravated by  the obsolescence of the scientific background on which his  system was based, for Hegel, of course, based his rejection of  the Newtonian system on the scientific conceptions of his  time.11 And it was precisely those conceptions that were to fall  into oblivion with astonishing speed. It is difficult to imagine a  less opportune time than the beginning of the nineteenth cen­ tury for seeking experimental and theoretical support for an  alternative to classical science. Although this time was charac­ terized by a remarkable extension of the experimental scope of  science (see Chapter IV) and by a proliferation of theories that  seemed to contradict Newtonian science, most of those theo­ ries had to be given up only a few years after their appearance.  At the end of the nineteenth c:entury, when Bergson under-</p><div id="pagenum"><p>123</p></div><p id="page">91 THE TWO CULTURES  took his search for an acceptable alternative to the science of  his time, he turned to intuition as a form of speculative knowl­ edge, but he presented it as quite different from that of the  Romantics. He explicitly stated that intuition is unable to pro­ duce a system but produces only results that are always partial  and nongeneralizable, results to be formulated with great cau­ tion. In contrast, generalization is an attribute of "intel­ ligence, " the greatest achievement of which is classical  science. Bergsonian intuition is a concentrated attention, an  increasingly difficult attempt to penetrate deeper into the sin­ gularity of things. Of course, to communicate, intuition must  have recourse to language-"in order to be transmitted, it will  have to use ideas as a conveyance. " 12 This it does with infinite  patience and circumspection, at the same time accumulating  images and comparisons in order to "embrace reality," 13 thus  suggesting in an increasingly precise way what cannot be com­ municated by means of general terms and abstract ideas.  Science and intuitiv e metaphysics "are or can become  equally precise and definite. They both bear upon reality it­ self. But each one of them retains only half of it so that one  could see in them, if one wished, two subdivisions of science  or two departments of metaphysics, if they did not mark diver­ gent directions of the activity of thought. " 14  The definition of these two divergent directions may also be  considered as the historical consequence of scientific evolu­ tion. For Bergson, it is no longer a question of finding scien­ tific alternatives to the physics of his time. In his view,  chemistry and biology had definitely chosen mechanics as  their model. The hopes that Diderot had cherished for the fu­ ture of chemistry and medicine had thus been dashed. In  Bergson's view, science is a whole and must therefore be  judged as a whole. And this is what he does when he presents  science as the product of a practical intelligence whose aim is  to dominate matter and that develops by abstraction and gen­ eralization the intellectual categories needed to achieve this  domination. Science is the product of our vital need to exploit  the world, and its concepts are determined by the necessity of  manipulating objects, of making predictions, and of achieving  reproducible actions. This is why rational mechanics repre­ sents the very essence of science, its actual embodiment. The </p><div id="pagenum"><p>124</p></div><p id="page">ORDER OUT OF CHAOS 92  other sciences are more vague, awkward manifestations of an  approach that is all the more successful the more inert and  disorganized the terrain it explores.  For Bergson all the limitations of scientific rationality can  be reduced to a single and decisive one: it is incapable of un­ derstanding duration since it reduces time to a sequence of  instantaneous states linked by a deterministic law.  "Time is invention, or it is nothing at all." 15 Nature is  change, the continual elaboration of the new, a totality being  created in an essentially open process of development without  any preestablished model. "Life progresses and endures in  time." 16 The only part of this progression that intelligence can  grasp is what it succeeds in fixing in the form of manipulable  and calculable elements and in referring to a time seen as  sheer juxtaposition of instants.  Therefore, physics "is limited to coupling simultaneities  between the events that make up this time and the posi­ tions of the mobile T on its trajectory . It detaches these  events from the whole, which at every moment puts on a  new form and which communicates to them something of  its novelty . It considers them in the abstract, such as they  would be outside of the living whole, that is to say, in a  time unrolled in space. It retains only the events or sys­ tems of events that can be thus isolated without being  made to undergo too profound a deformation, because  only these lend themselves to the application of its  method. Our physics dates from the day when it was  known how to isolate such systems. "17  When it comes to understanding duration itself, science is  powerless. What is needed is intuition, a "direct vision of the  mind by the mind. "18 "Pure change, real duration, is some­ thing spiritual. Intuition is what attains the spirit, duration,  pure change. I9  Can we say Bergson has failed in the same way that the  post-Kantian philosophy of nature failed? He has failed inso­ far as the metaphysics based on intuition he wished to create  has not materialized. He has not failed in that, unlike Hegel,  he had the good fortune to pass judgment upon science that  was, on the whole, firmly established-that is, classical sci-</p><div id="pagenum"><p>125</p></div><p id="page">93 THE TWO CULTURES  ence at its apotheosis, and thus identified problems which are  indeed still our problems. But, like the post-Kantian critics,  he identified the science of his time with science in general.  He thus attributed to science de jure limitations that were only  de facto. As a consequence he tried to define once and for all a  statu quo for the respective domains of science and other in­ tellectual activities. Thus the only perspective remaining open  for him was to introduce a way in which antagonistic ap­ proaches could at best merely coexist.  In conclusion, even if the way in which Bergson sums up the  achievement of classical science is still to some extent accept­ able, we can no longer accept it as a statement of the eternal  limits of the scientific enterprise. We conceive of it more as a  program that is beginning to be implemented by the meta­ morphosis science is now undergoing. In particu lar, we know  that time linked with motion does not exhaust the meaning of  time in physics. Thus the limitations Bergson criticized are  beginning to be overcome, not by abandoning the scientific  approach or abstract thinking but by perceiving the limitations  of the concepts of classical dynamics and by discovering new  formulations valid in more general situations.  Process and Reality: Whitehead  As we have emphasized, the element common to Kant, Hegel,  and Bergson is the search for an approach to reality that is  different from the approach of classical science. This is also  the fundamental aim of Whitehead's philosophy , which is reso­ lutely pre-Kantian. In his most important book, Process and  Reality, he puts us back in touch with the great philosophies of  the Classical Age and their quest for rigorous conceptual ex­ perimentation.  Whitehead sought to understand human experience as a pro­ cess belonging to nature, as physical existence. This challenge  led him, on the one hand, to reject the philosophic tradition  that defined subjective experience in terms of consciousness,  thought, and sense perception, and, on the other, to conceive  of all physical existence in terms of enjoyment, feeling, urge,  appetite, and yearning-that is, to cross swords with what he </p><div id="pagenum"><p>126</p></div><p id="page">ORDER OUT OF CHAOS 94  calls "scientific materialism," born in the seventeenth cen­ tury. Like Bergson, Whitehead was thus led to point out the  basic inadequacies of the theoretical scheme developed by  seventeenth-century science:  The seventeenth century had finally produced a scheme  of scientific thought framed by mathematicians, for the  use of mathematicians. The great characteristic of the  mathematical mind is its capacity for dealing with ab­ stractions; and for eliciting from them clear-cut demon­ strative trains of reasoning, entirely satisfactory so long  as it is those abstractions which you want to think about.  The enormous success of the scientific abstractions,  yielding on the one hand matter with its simple location  in space and time, on the other hand mind, perceiving,  suffering, reasoning, but not interfering, has foisted on to  philosophy the task of accepting them as the most con­ crete rendering of fact.  Thereby , modern philosophy has been ruined. It has  oscillated in a complex manner between three extremes.  There are the dualists, who accept matter and mind as on  equal basis, and the two varieties of monists, those who  put mind inside matter, and those who put matter inside  mind. But this juggling with abstractions can never over­ come the inherent confusion introduced by the ascription  of misplaced concreteness to the scientific scheme of the  seventeenth century . 20  However, Whitehead considered this to be only a temporary  situation. Science is not doomed to remain a prisoner of con­ fusion.  We have already raised the question of whether it is possible  to formulate a philosophy of nature that is not directed against  science. Whitehead's cosmology is the most ambitious at­ tempt to do so. Whitehead saw no basic contradiction be­ tween science and philosop hy. His purpose was to define the  conceptual field within which the problem of human experi­ ence and physical processes could be dealt with consistently  and to determine the conditions under which the problem  could be solved. What had to be done was to formulate: the:  principles necessary to characterize all forms of existence, </p><div id="pagenum"><p>127</p></div><p id="page">95 THE TWO CULTURES  from that of stones to that of man. It is precisely this univer­ sality that, in Whitehead' s opinion, defines his enterprise as  "philosophy ." While each scientific theory selects and ab­ stracts from the world's complexity a peculiar set of relations,  philosophy cannot favor any particular region of human expe­ rience. Through conceptual experimentation it must construct  a consistency that can accommodate all dimensions of experi­ ence, whether they belong to physics, physiol ogy, psycho logy,  biology , ethics, etc.  Whitehead understood perhaps more sharply than anyone  else that the creative evolution of nature could never be con­ ceived if the elements composing it were defined as permanent,  individual entities that maintained their identity throughout all  changes and interactions. But he also understood that to make  all permanence illusory , to deny being in the name of becom­ ing, to reject entities in favor of a continuous and ever-changing  flux meant falling once again into the trap always lying in wait  for philosophy-to "indulge in brilliant feats of explaining  away."21  Thus for Whitehead the task of philosophy was to reconcile  permanence and change, to conceive of things as processes, to  demonstrate that becoming forms entities, individual identi­ ties that are born and die. It is beyond the scope of this book to  give a detailed presentation of Whitehead's system. Let us  only emphasize that he demonstrated the connection between  a philosophy of relation-no element of nature is a permanent  support for changing relations; each receives its identity from  its relations with others-and a philosophy of innovating be­ coming. In the process of its genesis, each existent unifies the  multiplicity of the world, since it adds to this multiplicity an  extra set of relations. At the creation of each new entity "the  many become one and are increased by one. "22  In the conclusion of this book, we shall again encounter  Whitehead's question of permanence and change, this time as  it is raised in physics; we shall speak of entities formed by  their irreversible interaction with the world. Today physics has  discovered the need to assert both the distinction and interde­ pendence between units and relations. It now recognizes that,  for an interaction to be real, the "nature" of the related things  must derive from these relations, while at the same time the re­ lations must derive from the "nature" of the things (see Chap-</p><div id="pagenum"><p>128</p></div><p id="page">ORDER OUI OF CHAOS 96  ter X). This is the forerunner of "self-consisten t" descriptions  as expressed, for instance, by the "bootstrap" philosophy in  elemen tary-par ticle physics, which asserts the universal con­ nectedness of all particles. However , when Whitehead wrote  Process and Reality, the situation of physics was quite dif­ ferent, and Whitehead's philosophy found an echo only in bi­ ology.23  Whitehead's case as well as Bergson's convince us that only  an opening, a widening of science can end the dichotomy be­ tween science and philosophy . This widening of science is pos­ sible only if we revise our conception of time. To deny time­ that is, to reduce it to a mere deployment of a reversible law­ is to abandon the possibility of defining a conception of nature  coherent with the hypothesis that nature produced living  beings, particularly man. It dooms us to choosing between an  antiscientific philosoph y and an alienating science.  "Ignoramus, lgnoramibus": The Positivists Strain  Another method of overcoming the difficulties of classical ra­ tionality implied in classical science was to separate what was  scientifically most fruitful from what is "true." This is another  form of the Kantian cleavage. In his 1865 address "On the Goal  of the Natural Sciences," Kirchoff stated that the ultimate  goal of science is to reduce every phenomenon to motion, mo­ tion that in turn is described by theoretical mechanics. A simi­ lar statement was made by Helmholtz, a chemist, physician,  physicist, and physiologist who dominated the German uni­ versities at the time when they were becoming the hub of Eu­ ropean science. He stated: "the phenomena of nature are to be  referred back to motions of material particles possessing un­ changeable moving forces, which are dependent upon condi­ tions of space alone. "24  The aim of the natural sciences, therefore, was to reduce all  observations to the laws formulated by Newton and extended  by such illustrious physicists and mathematicians as Lagrange,  Hamilton, and others. We were not to ask why these forces  exist and enter Newton's equation. In any case, we could not  "understand" matter or forces even if we used these concepts </p><div id="pagenum"><p>129</p></div><p id="page">97 THE TWO CULTURES  to formulate the laws of dynamics. The why, the basic nature  of forces and masses, remains hidden from us. Du Bois Rey­ mond, as we already mentioned, expressed concisely the  limitations of our knowledge: "Ignoramus, ignoramibus. " Sci­ ence provides no access to the mysteries of the universe. What  then is science?  We have already referred to Mach's influential view: Science  is part of the Darwinian struggle for life. It helps us to organize  our experience. It leads to an economy of thought. Mathemati­ cal laws are nothing more than conventions useful for sum­ marizing the results of possible experiments. At the end of the  nineteenth century , scientific positivism exercised a great in­ tellectual appeal. In France it influenced the work of eminent  thinkers such as Duhem and Poincare.  One more step in the elimination of "contemptible meta­ physics" and we come to the Vienna school. Here science is  granted jurisdiction over all positive knowledge and philoso­ phy needed to keep this positive knowledge in .order. This  meant a radical submission of all rational knowledge and ques­ tions to science. When Reichenbach, a distinguished neo­ positivist philosoph er, wrote a book on the "direction of  time," he stated:  There is no other way to solve the problem of time than  the way through physics. More than any other science,  physics has been concerned with the nature of time. If  time is objective the physicist must have discovered the  fact. If there is Becoming, the physicist must know it; but  if time is merely subjective and Being is timeless, the  physicist must have been able to ignore time in his con­ struction of reality and describe the world without the  help of time .... It is a hopeless enterprise to search for  the nature of time without studying physics. If there is a  solution to the philosophical problem of time, it is written  down in the equations of mathematical physics. 25  Reichenbach's work is of great interest to anyone wishing to  see what physics has to say on the subject of time, but it is not  so much a book on the philosophy of nature as an account of  the way in which the problem of time challenges scientists, not  philosophers. </p><div id="pagenum"><p>130</p></div><p id="page">ORDER OUT OF CHAOS 98  What then is the role of philosophy? It has often been said  that philosophy should become the science of science. Phi­ losophy's objective would then be to analyze the methods of  science, to axiomatize and to clarify the concepts used. Such  a role would make of the former "queen of sciences" some­ thing like their housemaid. Of course, there is the possibility  that this clarification of concepts would permit further prog­ ress, that philosophy understood in this way would, through  the use of other methods-logic, semantics-produce new  knowledge comparable to that of science proper. It is this hope  that sustains the "analytic philosophy" so prevalent in Anglo­ American circles. We do not want to minimize the interest of  such an inquiry . However , the problems that concern us here  are quite different. We do not aim to clarify or axiomatize ex­ isting knowledge but rather to close some fundamental gaps in  this knowledge.  A New Start  In the first part of this book we described, on the one hand,  dialogue with nature that classical science made possible and,  on the other, the precarious cultural position of science. Is  there a way out? In this chapter we have discussed some at­ tempts to reach alternative ways of knowledge. We have also  considered the positivist view, which separates science from  reality.  The moments of greatest excitement at scientific meetings  very often occur when scientists discuss questions that are  likely to have no practical utility whatsoever, no survival  value-topics such as possible interpretations of quantum me­ chanics, or the role of the expanding universe in our concept  of time. If the positivistic view, which reduces science to a  symbolic calculus, was accepted , science would lose much of  its appeal. Newton's synthesis between theoretical concepts  and active knowledge would be shattered. We would be back  to the situation familiar from the time of Greece and Rome,  with an unbridgeable gap between technical, practical knowl­ edge on one side and theoretical knowledge on the other.  For the ancients. nature was a source of wisdom. Medieval  nature spoke of God. In modern times nature has become so </p><div id="pagenum"><p>131</p></div><p id="page">99 THE TWO CULTURES  silent that Kant considered that science and wisdom, science  and truth, ought to be completely separated. We have been  living with this dichotomy for the past two centuries. It is time  for it to come to an end. As far as science is concerned, the  time is ripe for this to happen. From our present perspective,  the first step toward a possible reunification of knowledge was  the discovery in the nineteenth century of the theory of heat,  of the laws of thermody namics. Thermodynamics appears as  the first form of a "science of complexity ." This is the science  we now wish to describe, from its formulation to recent de­ velopments. </p><div id="pagenum"><p>132</p></div><p id="page">I  I </p><div id="pagenum"><p>133</p></div><p id="page">BOOK TWO  THE SCIENCE OF  COMPLEXITY </p><div id="pagenum"><p>134</p></div><p id="page">I  I I  I I  I </p><div id="pagenum"><p>135</p></div><p id="page">CHAPTER IV  ENERGY AND THE  INDUSTRIAL AGE  Heat, the Rival of Gravitation  Ignis mutat res. Ageless wisdom has always linked chemistry  to the "science of fire." Fire became part of experimental sci­ ence during the eighteenth century , starting a conceptual  transformation that forced science to reconsider what it had  previously .. rejected in the name of a mechanistic world view,  topics such as irreversibility and complexi ty.  Fire transforms matter; fire leads to chemical reactions, to  processes such as melting and evaporation. Fire makes fuel  burn and release heat. Out of all this common knowledge,  nineteenth-century science concentrated on the single fact  that combustion produces heat and that heat may lead to an  increase in volume; as a result, combustion produces work.  Fire leads, therefore, to a new kind of machine, the heat en­ gine, the technological innovation on which industrial society  has been founded. I  It is interesting to note that Adam Smith was working on his  Wealth of Nations and collecting data on the prospects and  determinants of industrial growth at the same university at  which James Watt was putting the finishing touches on his  steam engine. Yet the only use for coal that Adam Smith could  find was to provide heat for workers. In the eighteenth cen­ tury, wind, water, and animals, and the simple machines  driven by them, were still the only conceivable sources of  power.  The rapid spread of the British steam engine brought about  a new interest in the mechanical effect of heat, and ther­ modynamics. born out of this interest, was thus not so much  103 </p><div id="pagenum"><p>136</p></div><p id="page">ORDER OUT OF CHAOS 104  concerned with the nature of heat as with heat's possibilities  for producing "mechanical energy."  As for the birth of the "science of complex ity," we propose  to date it in 1811, the year Baron Jean-Joseph Fourier , the pre­ fect oflsere, won the prize of the French Academy of Sciences  for his mathematical description of the propagation of heat in  solids.  The result stated by Fourier was surprisingly simple and ele­ gant: heat flow is proportional to the gradient of temperature.  It is remarkable that this simple law applies to matter, whether  its state is solid, liquid, or gaseous. Moreover, it remains valid  whatever the chemical composition of the body is, whether it  is iron or gold. It is only the coefficient of proportionality be­ tween the heat flow and the gradient of temperature that is  specific to each substance.  Obviou sly, the universal character of Fourier's law is not  directly related to dynamic interactions as expressed by New­ ton's law, and its formulation may thus be considered the start­ ing point of a new type of science. Indeed, the simplicity of  Fourier's mathematical description of heat propagation stands  in sharp contrast to the complexity of matter considered from  the molecular point of view. A solid, a gas, or a liquid are  macroscopic systems formed by an immense number of mole­ cules, and yet heat conductivity is described by a single law.  Fourier formulated his result at the time when Laplace's  school dominated European science. Laplace, Lagrange, and  their disciples vainly joined forces to criticize Fourier's the­ ory, but they were forced to retreat. 2 At the peak of its glory,  the Laplacian dream met with its first setback. A physical the­ ory had been created that was every bit as mathematically  rigorous as the mechanical laws of motion but that remained  completely alien to the Newtonian world. From this time on,  mathematics, physics, and Newtonian science ceased to be  synonymous.  The formulation of the law of heat conduction had a lasting  influence. Curiousl y, in France and Britain it was the starting  point of different historical paths leading to our time.  In France, the failure of Laplace's dream led to the positivist  classification of science into the well-defined compartments  introduced by Auguste Comte. The Comtean division of sci­ ence has been well analyzed by Michel Serres3-heat and </p><div id="pagenum"><p>137</p></div><p id="page">105 ENERGY AND THE INDUST RIAL AGE  gravity, two universals, coexist in physics. Worse, as Comte  was to state later, they are antagonistic. Gravitation acts on an  inert mass that submits to it without being affected by it in any  other way than by the motion it acquires or transmits. Heat  transforms matter, determines changes of state, and leads to a  modification of intrinsic properties. This was, in a sense, a  confirmation of the protest made by the anti-Newtonian chem­ ists of the eighteenth century and by all those who emphasized  the difference between the purely spatiotemporal behavior at- . tributed to mass and the specific activity of matter. This dis­ tinction was used as a foundation for the classification of the  sciences, all placed by Comte under the common sign of  order-that is, of equilibrium. To the mechanical equilibrium  between forces the positivist classification simply adds the  concept of thermal equilibrium.  In Britain, on the other hand, the theory of heat propagation  did not mean giving up the attempt to unite the fields of knowl­ edge but opened a new line of inquiry, the progressive formula­ tion of a theory of irreversible processes.  Fourier's law, when applied to an isolated body with an un­ homogeneous temperature distribution, describes the gradual  onset of thermal equilibrium. The effect of heat propagation is  to equalize progressively the distribution of temperature until  homogeneity is reached. Everyone knew that this was an irre­ versible process; a century before, Boerhave had stressed that  heat always spread and leveled out. The science of complex  phenomena-invol ving interaction among a large number of  particles-and the occurrence of temporal asymmetry thus  were linked from the outset. But heat conduction did not be­ come the starting point of an investigation into the nature of  irreversibility before it was first linked with the notion of dis­ sipation as seen from an engineering point of view. 4  Let us go into some detail about the structure of the new  "science of heat" as it took shape in the early nineteenth cen­ tury. Like mechanics, the science of heat implied both an orig­ inal conception of the physical object and a definition of  machines or engines-that is, an identification of cause and  effect in a specific mode of production of mechanical work.  The study of the physical processes involving heat entails  defining a system, not, as in the case of dynamics, by the posi­ tion and velocity of its constituents (there are some IQ23 mole-</p><div id="pagenum"><p>138</p></div><p id="page">ORDER OUT OF CHAOS 106  cutes in a volume of gas or a solid fragment of the order of a  cm3), but by a set of macroscopic parameters such as tem­ perature, pressure, volume, and so on. In addition, we have to  take into account the boundary conditions that describe the  relation of the system to its environment.  Let us consider specific heat, one of the characteristic prop­ erties of a macroscopic system, as an example. The specific  heat is a measure of the amount of heat required to raise the  temperature of a system by one degree while its volume or  pressure is kept constant. To study the specific heat-for in­ stance, at constant volume-the system must be brought into  interaction with its environm ent; it must receive a certain  amount of heat while at the same time its volume is kept con­ stant and its pressure is allowed to vary.  More general ly, a system may be subjected to mechanical  action (for example, either the pressure or the volume may be  fixed by using a piston device), thermal action (a certain  amount of heat may be given to or removed from the system,  or the system itself may be brought to a given temperature  through heat exchange), or chemica l action (a flux of reactants  and reaction products between the system and the environ­ ment). As we have already mentioned, pressure, volume,  chemical composition, and temperature are the classical phys­ icochemical parameters in terms of which the properties of  macroscopic systems are defined. Thermod ynamics is the sci­ ence of the correlation among the variations in these proper­ ties. In comparison with dynamic objects, thermodynamic  objects therefore lead to a new point of view. The aim of the  theory is not to predict the changes in the system in terms of  the interactions among particles; it aims instead to predict  how the system will react to modifications we may impose on  it from the outside.  A mechanica l engine gives back in the form of work the  potential energy it has received from the outside world. Both  cause and effect are of the same nature and, at least ideally,  equivalent. In contrast, the heat engine implies material  changes of states, including the transformation of the system's  mechanical properties, dilatation, and expansion. The me­ chanical work produced must be seen as the result of a true  process of transformation and not only as a transmission of  movement. Thus the heat engine is not merely a passive de-</p><div id="pagenum"><p>139</p></div><p id="page">107 ENERGY AND THE INDUSTRIAL AGE  vice; strictly speaking, it produces motion. This is the origin of  a new problem: in order to restore the system's capacity to  produce motion, the system must be brought back to its initial  state. Thus a second process is needed, a second change of  state that compensates for the change producing the motion.  In a heat engine, this second process, which is opposite to the  first, involves cooling the system until it regains its initial tem­ perature, pressure, and volume.  The problem of the efficiency of heat engines, of the ratio  between the work done and the heat that must be supplied to  the system to produce the two mutually compensating pro­ cesses, is the very point at which the concept of irreversible  process was introduced into physics. We shall return to the  importance of Fourier's law in this context. Let us first de­ scribe the essential role played by the principle of energy con­ servation.  The Principle of the Conservation of Energy  We have already emphasized the central place of energy in  classical dynamics. The Hamiltonian (the sum of the kinetic  and potential energies) is expressed in terms of canonical vari­ ables-coordinates and momenta-and leads to changes in  these variables while itself remaining constant throughout the  motion. Dynamic change merely modifies the respective im­ portance of potential and kinetic energy, conserving their to­ tality.  The early nineteenth century was characterized by unprece­ dented experimental ferment. 5 Physicists realized that motion  does more than bring about changes in the relative position of  bodies in space. New processes identified in the laboratories  gradually formed a network that ultimately linked all the new  fields of physics with other, more traditional branches, such as  mechanics. One of these connections was accidentally dis­ covered by Galvani. Before him, only static electric charges  were known. Galvani, using a frog's body, set up the first ex­ perimental electric current. Volta soon recognized that the  ··galvanic" contractions in the frog were actually the effect of  an electric current passing through it. In 1800, Volta con-</p><div id="pagenum"><p>140</p></div><p id="page">ORDER OUT OF CHAOS 108  structed a chemical battery; electricity could thus be pro­ duced by chemical reactions. Then came electrolysis: electric  current can modify chemical affinities and produce chemical  reactions. But this current can also produce light and heat;  and, in 1820, Oersted discovered the magnetic effects pro­ duced by electrical currents. In 1822, Seebeck showed that,  inversely, heat could produce electricity and, in 1834, how  matter could be cooled by electrici ty. Then, in 1831, Faraday  induced an electric current by means of magnetic effects. A  whole network of new effects was gradually uncovered. The  scientific horizon was expanding at an unprecedented rate.  In 1847 a decisive step was taken by Joule: the links among  chemistry , the science of heat, electricit y, magnetism, and bi­ ology were recognized as a "conversi on." The idea of con­ version, which postulates that "something" is quantitatively  conserved while it is qualitatively transformed, generalizes  what occurs during mechanical motion. As we have seen, total  energy is conserved while potential energy is converted into  kinetic energy, or vice versa. Joule defined a general equiv­ alent for physicochemical transformations, thus making it  possible to measure the quantity conserved. This quantity was  later6 to become known as "energy." He established the first  equivalence by measuring the mechanical work required to  raise the temperature of a given quantity of water by one de­ gree. A unifying element had been discovered in the middle of  a bewildering variety of new discoveries. The conservation of  energy, throughout the various transfor mations undergone by  physical, chemical, and biological systems, was to provide a  guiding principle in the exploration of the new processes.  No wonder that the principle of the conservation of energy  was so important to nineteenth-centur y physicists. For many  of them it meant the unification of the whole of nature. Joule  expressed this conviction in an English context:  Indeed the phenomena of nature, whether mechanical,  chemical, or vital, consist almost entirely in a continual  conversion of attraction through space, living force  (N.B., kinetic energy) and heat into one another . Thus it  is that order is maintained in the universe-nothing is de­ ranged, nothing ever lost, but the entire machinery , com-</p><div id="pagenum"><p>141</p></div><p id="page">109 ENERGY AND THE INDUSTRIAL AGE  plicated as it is, works smoothly and harmoniously. And  though, as in the awful vision of Ezekiel, "wheel may be  in the middle of wheel," and everything may appear com­ plicated and involved in the apparent confusion and intri­ cacy of an almost ·endless variety of causes, effects,  conversions, and arrangements, yet is the most perfect  regularity preserved-the whole being governed by the  sovereign will of God. 7  The case of the Germans Helmholtz, Mayer, and Lie big-all  three belonging to a culture that would have rejected Joule's  conviction on the grounds of strictly positivist practice-is  even more striking. At the time of their discoveries, none of  the three was, strictly speaking, a physicist. On the other  hand, all of them were interested in the physiology of respira­ tion. This had become, since Lavoisier , a model problem in  which the functioning of a living being could be described in  precise physical and chemical terms, such as the combustion  of oxygen, the release of heat, and muscular work. It was thus  a question that would attract physiologists and chemists hos­ tile to Romantic speculation and eager to contribute to experi­ mental science. However , judging from the account of how  these three scientists came to the conclusion that respiration,  and then the whole of nature, was governed by some funda­ mental "equivalence," we may state that the German philo­ sophic tradition had imbued them with a conception that was  quite alien to a positivist position: without hesitation they all  concluded that the whole of nature, in each of its details, is  ruled by this single principle of conservation.  The case of Mayer is the most remarkable.s As a young doc­ tor working in the Dutch colonie s in Java, he noticed the bright  red color of the venous blood of one of his patients. This led  him to conclude that, in a warm, tropical climate, the inhabi­ tants need to burn less oxygen to maintain body temperature;  this results in the bright color of their blood. Mayer went on to  establish the balance between oxygen consumption, which is  the source of energy, and the energy consumption involved in  maintaining body temperature despite heat losses and manual  work. This was quite a leap, since the color of the blood could  as well be due to the patient's ··taziness. ,, But Mayer went </p><div id="pagenum"><p>142</p></div><p id="page">ORDER OUT OF CHAOS 110  further and concluded that the balance between oxygen con­ sumption and heat loss was merely the particular manifesta­ tion of the existence of an indestructible "force" underlying all  phenomena.  This tendency to see natural phenomena as the products of  an underlying reality that remains constant throughout its  transformations is strikingly reminiscent of Kant. Kant's influ­ ence can also be recognized in another idea held by some  physiologists, the distinction between vitalism as philosophi­ cal speculation and the problem of scientific methodolo gy. For  those physiologists, even if there was a "vital" force underly­ ing the function of living beings, the object of physiology  would nonetheless be purely physicochemical in nature. From  the two points of view mentioned, Kantianism, which ratified  the systematic form taken by mathematical physics during the  eighteenth century , can also be identified as one of the roots of  the renewal of physics in the nineteenth century .9  Helmholtz quite openly acknowledged Kant's influence.  For Helmholtz, the principle of the conserva tion of energy was  merely the embodiment in physics of the general a priori re­ quirement on which all science is based-the postulate that  there is a basic invariance underlying natural transformations:  The problem of the sciences is, in the first place, to seek  the laws by which the particula r processes of nature may  be referred to, and deduced from, general rules.  We are justified, and indeed impelled in this proceed­ ing, by the conviction that every change in nature must  have a sufficient cause. The proximate causes to which  we refer phenomena may, in themselves, be either vari­ able or invariable; in the former case the above convic­ tion impels us to seek for causes to account for the  change, and thus we proceed until we at length arrive at  final causes which are unchangeable, and which there­ fore must, in all cases where the exterior conditions are  the same, produce the same invariable effects. The final  aim of the theoretic natural sciences is therefore to dis­ cover the ultimate and unchangeable causes of natural  phenomena. tO  With the principle of the conservation of energy, the idea of </p><div id="pagenum"><p>143</p></div><p id="page">111 ENERGY AND THE INDUSTRIAL AGE  a new golden age of physics began to take shape, an age that  would lead to the ultimate generalization of mechanics.  The cultural implications were far-reaching, and they in­ cluded a conception of society and men as energy-transforming  engines. But energy conversion cannot be the whole story. It  represents the aspects of nature that are peaceful and control­ lable, but below there must be another , more "active" level.  Nietzsche was one of those who detected the echo of creations  and destructions that go far beyond mere conservation or con­ version. Indeed, only difference, such as a difference of tem­ perature or of potential energy, can produce results that are  also differences.11 Energy conversion is merely the destruc­ tion of a difference, together with the creation of another dif­ ference. The power of nature is thus concealed by the use of  equivalences. However , there is another aspect of nature that  involves the boilers of steam engines, chemical transforma­ tions, life and death, and that goes beyond equivalences and  conservation of energy.12 Here we reach the most original con­ tribution of thermodynamics, the concept of irreversibility .  Heat Engines and the Arrow of Time  When we compare mechanical devices to thermal engines, for  example, to the red-hot boilers of locomotives, we can see at a  glance the gap between the classical age and nineteenth­ century technology . Still, physicists first thought that this gap  could be ignored, that thermal engines could be described like  mechanical ones, neglecting the crucial fact that fuel used by  the steam engine disappears forever. But such complacency  soon became impossible. For classical mechanics the symbol  of nature was the clock; for the Industrial Age, it became a  reservoir of energy that is always threatened with exhaustion.  The world is burning like a furnace; energy, although being  conserved, also is being dissipated.  The original formul ation of the second law of thermo­ dynamics, which would lead to the first quantitative expres­ sion of irreversibil ity, was made by Sadi Carnot in 1824, before  the general formulation of the principle of �;onservation of en­ ergy by Mayer (1842) and Helmholtz (1847). Carnot analyzed </p><div id="pagenum"><p>144</p></div><p id="page">ORDER OUT OF CHAOS 112  the heat engine, closely following the work of his father, Lazare  Carnot, who had produced an influential description of me ..  chanical engines.  The description of mechanical engines assumes motion as a  given. In modern language this corresponds to conservation of  energy and momentum. Motion is merely converted and  transferred to other bodies. But the analogy between mechani ..  cal and thermal engines was a natural one for Sadi Carnot,  since he assumed, with most of the scientists of his time, that  heat as well as mechanical energy are conserved.  Water falling from one level to another can drive a mill. Sim ..  ilarly, Sadi Carnot assumed two sources, one of which gives  heat to the engine system, and the other, at a different tern ..  perature, which absorbs the heat given by the former. It is the  motion of the heat through the engine, between the two  sources at different temperatures-that is, the driving force of  fire-that will make the engine work.  Carnot repeated his father's question s.l3 Which machine  will have the highest efficiency? What are the sources of loss?  What are the processes whereby heat propagates without pro­ ducing work? Lazare Carnot had concluded that in order to  obtain maximum efficiency from a mechanical machine it  must be built and made to function to reduce to a minimum  shocks, friction, or discontinuous changes of speed-in short,  all that is caused by the sudden contact of bodies moving at  different speeds. In doing so he had merely applied the phys­ ics of his time: only continuous phenomena are conservative;  all abrupt changes in motion cause an irreversible loss of the  "living force." Similarly , the ideal heat engine, instead of hav­ ing to avoid all contacts between bodies moving at different  speeds, will have to avoid all contact between bodies having  different temperatures.  The cycle therefore has to be designed so that no tempera­ ture change results from direct heat flow between two bodies  at different temperatures. Since such flows have no mechani­ cal effect, they would merely lead to a loss of efficiency.  The ideal Carnot cycle is thus a rather tricky device that  achieves the paradoxical result of a heat transfer between two  sources at different temperatures without any contact between  bodies of different temperatures. It is divided into four phases.  During each of the two isothermal phases, the system is in </p><div id="pagenum"><p>145</p></div><p id="page">113 ENERGY AND THE INDUSTRIAL AGE  contact with one of the two heat sources and is kept at the  tempera ture of this source. When in contact with the hot  source, it absorbs heat and expands; when in contact with the  cold source, it loses heat and contracts. The two isothermal  phases are linked up by two phases in which the system is  isolated from the sources -that is, heat no longer enters or  leaves the system, but the tempera ture of the latter changes as  a result, respective ly, of expansion and compression. The vol­ ume continues to change until the system has passed from the  temperature of one source to that of the other.  p  '  '  '  ...  ..  ..  ..  ...

Between b and c, the system is kept expanding while in thermal  isolation; its temperature goes down from TH to TL. Those two steps produce  mechanical energy. Between c and d, there is a second isothermal change:  the system is compressed and releases heat while being kept at temperature  TL. Between d and a, the system, again isolated, is compressed while its  temperature increases to temperature TH. </p><div id="pagenum"><p>146</p></div><p id="page">ORDER OUT OF CHAOS 114  It is quite remarkable that this description of an ideal ther­ mal engine does not mention the irreversible processes that  are at the basis of its realization. No mention is made of the  furnace in which the coal is burning. The model is only con­ cerned with the effect of the combustion, which permits the  maintenance of the temperature difference between the two  sources.  In 1850, Clausius described the Carnot cycle from the new  perspective provided by the conservation of energy. He dis­ covered that the need for two sources and the formula for the­ oretical efficiency stated by Carnot express a specific problem  with heat engines: the need for a process compensating for  conversion (in the present instance, cooling by contact with a  cold source) to restore the engine to its initial mechanical and  thermal conditions. Balance relations expressing energy con­ version are now joined by new equivalence relations between  the effects of two processes on the state of the system, heat  flux between the sources and conversion of heat into work. A  new science, thermodynamics, which linked mechanical and  thermal effects, came into being.  The work of Clausius explicitly demonstrated that we can­ not use without restriction the seemingly inexhaustible energy  reservoir that nature provides. Not all energy-conse rving pro­ cesses are possible. An energy difference, for instance, cannot  be created without the destruction of an at least equivalent  energy difference. Thus in the ideal Carnot cycle, the price for  the work produced is paid by the heat, which is transferr ed  from one source to the other. The outcome, as expressed by  the mechanical work produced on one side, and the transfer of  heat on the other, is linked by an equivalence. This equiv­ alence is valid in both directions. By working in reverse, the  same machine can restore the initial temperature difference  while consuming the work produced. No heat engine can be  constructed using a single source of heat.  Clausius was no more concerned than Carnot with the  losses whereby all real engines have an efficiency lower than  the ideal value predicted by the theory. His description, like  that of Carnot, corresponds to an idealization. It leads to the'  definition of the limit nature imposes on the yield of thermal  engines. </p><div id="pagenum"><p>147</p></div><p id="page">115 ENERGY AND THE INDUSTRIAL AGE  However, since the eighteenth century , the status of idealiza­ tions had changed. Based as it was on the principle of the con­ servation of energy, the new science claimed to describe not  only idealizations, but also nature itself, including "losses."  This raised a new problem, whereby irreversibility entered  physics. How does one describe what happens in a real en­ gine? How does one include losses in the energy balance?  How do they reduce efficiency? These questions paved the  way to the second law of thermodynamics.  From Technol ogy to Cosmol ogy  As we have seen, the question raised by Carnot and Clausius  led to a description of ideal engines that was based on conser­ vation and compensation. In addition, it provided an oppor­ tunity for presenting new problems, such as the dissipation of  energy. William Thomson, who had great respect for Fourier's  work, was quick to grasp the importance of the problem, and  in 1852 he was the first to formulate the second law of thermo­ dynamics.  It was Fourier's heat propagation that Carnot had identified  as a possible cause for the power losses in a heat engine. Car­ not's cycle, no longer the ideal cycle but the "real" cycle, thus  became the point of convergence of the two universalities dis­ covered in the nineteenth century-energy conversion and  heat propagation. The combination of these two discoveries  led Thomson to formulate his new principle: the existence in  nature of a universal tendency toward the degradation of me­ chanical energy. Note the word "universal," which has ob­ vious cosmological connotations.  The world of Laplace was eternal, an ideal perpetual-motion  machine. Since Thomson's cosmology is not merely a reflec­ tion of the new ideal heat engine but also incorporates the con­ sequences of the irreversible propagation of heat in a world in  which energy is conserved. This world is described as an engine  in which heat is converted into motion only at the price of some  irreversible waste and useless dissipation. Effect-producing  differences in nature progressively diminish. The world uses </p><div id="pagenum"><p>148</p></div><p id="page">ORDER OUT OF CHAOS 116  up its differences as it goes from one conversion to another  and tends toward a final state of thermal equilibrium, "heat  death." In accordance with Fourier's law, in the end there will  no longer be any differences of temperature to produce a me­ chanical effect.  Thomson thus made a dizzy leap from engine technology to  cosmology . H�s formulation of the second law was couched in  the scientific terminology of his time: the conservation of en­ ergy, engines, and Fourier's law. It is clear, moreover , that the  part played by the cultural context was important. It is gener­ ally accepted that the problem of time took on a new impor­ tance during the nineteenth century . Indeed, the essential role  of time began to be noticed in all fields-in geology , in biology ,  in language, as well as in the study of human social evolution  and ethics. But it is interesting that the specific form in which  time was introduced in physics, as a tendency toward homoge­ neity and death, reminds us more of ancient mythological and  religious archetypes than of the progressive complexification  and diversification described by biology and the social sci­ ences. The return of these ancient themes can be seen as a  cultural repercussion of the social and economic upheavals of  the time. The rapid transfor mation of the technological mode  of interaction with nature, the constantly accelerating pace of  change experienced by the nineteenth century , produced a  deep anxiety. This anxiety is still with us and takes various  forms, from the repeated proposals for a "zero growth" so­ ciety or for a moratorium on scientifi c research to the  announcement of "scientific truths" concerning our disin­ tegrating universe. Present knowledge in astrophysics is still  scanty and very problematic, since in this field gravitational  effects play an essential role and problems imply the simul­ taneous use of thermodynamics and relativity. Yet most texts  in this field are unanimous in predicting final doom. The con­ clusion of a recent book reads:  The unpalatable truth appears to be that the inexorable  disintegration of the universe as we know it seems as­ sured, the organization which sustains all ordered ac­ tivity, frem men to galaxies, is slowly but inevitably  running down, and may even be overtaken by total grav­ itational collapse into oblivion.t4 </p><div id="pagenum"><p>149</p></div><p id="page">117 ENERGY AND THE INDUSTRIAL AGE  Others are more optimistic. In an excellent article on the  energy of the universe, Freeman Dyson has written:  It is conceivable however that life may have a larger role  to play than we have yet imagined. Life may succeed  against all of the odds in molding the universe to its own  purpose. And the design of the inanimate universe may  not be as detached from the potentialities of life and intel­ ligence as scientists of the twentieth century have tended  to suppose. 15  In spite of the important progress made by Hawking and oth­ ers, our knowledge of large-scale transformations in our uni­ verse remains inadequate.  The Birth of Entropy  In 1865, it was Clausius ' turn to make the leap from technol­ ogy to cosmology . At the outset he merely reformulated his  earlier conclusions, but in doing so he introduced a new con­ cept, entropy. His first goal was to distinguish clearly between  the concepts of conservation and of reversibility. Unlike mechan­ ical transform ations, where reversibility and conservation  coincide, a physicochemical transformation may conserve en­ ergy even though it cannot be reversed. This is true, for in­ stance, in the case of friction, in which motion is converted  into heat, or in the case of heat conduction as it was described  by Fourier .  We are already familiar with energy, which is a function of  the state of a system-that is, a function dependent only on  the value of the parameters (pressure, volume, temperature)  by which that state may be defined.t6 But we must go beyond  the principle of energy conservation and find a way to express  the distinction between "useful" exchanges of energy in the  Carnot cycle and "dissipated" energy that is irreversibly  wasted.  This is precisely the role of Clausius' new function, entropy,  generally denoted by S.  Apparently Clausius merely wished to express in a new form </p><div id="pagenum"><p>150</p></div><p id="page">ORDER OUT OF CHAOS 118  the obvious requirement that an engine return to its initial  state at the end of its cycle. The first definition of entropy is  centered on conservation: at the end of each cycle, whether  ideal or not, the function of the system's state, entropy, returns  to its initial value. But the parallel between entropy and en­ ergy ends as soon as we abandon idealization s.t7  Let us consider the variation of the entropy dS over a short  time interval dt. The situation is quite different for ideal and  real engines. In the first case, dS may be expressed completely  in terms of the exchanges between the engine and its environ­ ment. We can set up experiments in which heat is given up by  the system instead of flowing into the system. The corre­ sponding change in entropy would simply have its sign  changed. This kind of contribution to entropy, which we shall  call deS, is therefore reversible in the sense that it can have  either a positive or a negative sign. The situation is drastically  different in a real engine. Here, in addition to reversible ex­ changes, we have irreversible processes inside the system,  such as heat losses, friction, and so on. These produce an en­ tropy increase or "entropy production" inside the system.  This increase of entropy, which we shall call diS, cannot  change its sign through a reversal of the heat exchange with  the outside world. Like all irreversible processes (such as heat  conduction), entropy production always proceeds in the same  direction. In other words, diS can only be positive or vanish in  the absence of irreversible processes. Note that the positive  sign of diS is chosen merely by convention; it could just as  well have been negative. The point is that the variation is mo­ notonous, that entropy production cannot change its sign as  time goes on.  The notations deS and diS have been chosen to remind the  reader that the first term refers to exchanges (e) with the out­ side world, while the second refers to the irreversible pro­ cesses inside (i) the system. The entropy variation dS is  therefore the sum of the two terms deS and diS, which have  quite different physical meanings. 18  To grasp the peculiar feature of this decomposition of en­ tropy variation into two parts, it is useful to apply our formula­ tion to energy. Let us denote energy by E and variation over a  short time dt by dE. Of course, we would still write that dE is  equal to the sum of a term deE due to the exchanges of energy </p><div id="pagenum"><p>151</p></div><p id="page">119 ENERGY AND THE INDUSTRIAL AGE  and a term diE linked to the "internal production" of energy.  However , the principle of the conservation of energy states  that energy is never "produced" but only transferred from one  place to another . The variation in energy dE is then reduced to  deE. On the other hand, if we take a nonconse rved quantity ,  such as the quantity of hydrogen molecules contained in a ves­ sel, this quantity may vary both as the result of adding hydro­ gen to the vessel or through chemical reactions occurring  inside the vessel. But in this case, the sign of the "production"  is not determined. Depending on the circumstances, we can  produce or destroy hydrogen molecules by transferring hydro­ gen atoms to other chemical components. The peculiar feature  of the second law is the fact that the production term diS is  always positive. The production of entropy expresses the oc­ currence of irreversible changes inside the system.  Clausius was able to express quantitatively the entropy flow  deS in terms of the heat received (or given up) by the system.  In a world dominated by the concepts of reversibility and con­ servation, this was his main concern. Regarding the irrevers­ ible processes involved in entropy production, he merely stated  the existence of the inequality diS/dt>O. Even so, important  progress had been made, for, if we leave the Carnot cycle and  consider other thermodynamic systems, the distinction be­ tween entropy flow and entropy production can still be made.  For an isolated system .that has no exchanges with its environ­ ment, the entropy flow is, by definition, zero. Only the pro­ duction term remains, and the system's entropy can only  increase or remain constant. Here, then, it is no longer a ques­ tion of irreversible transformations considered as approximations  of reversible transformations; increasing entropy corresponds  to the spontaneous evolution of the system. Entropy thus be­ comes an "indicator of evolution," or an "arrow of time," as  Eddington aptly called it. For all isolated systems, the future  is the direction of increasing entropy.  What system would be better "isolated" than the universe  as a whole? This concept is the basis of the cosmological for­ mulation of the two laws of thermodynamics given by Clausius  in 1865:  Die Energie der Welt ist konstant.  Die Entropie der Welt strebt einem Maximum zu.19  The statement that the entropy of an isolated system in-</p><div id="pagenum"><p>152</p></div><p id="page">ORDER OUT OF CHAOS 120  creases to a maximum goes far beyond the technological prob­ lem that gave rise to thermodynamics. Increasing entropy is  no longer synonymous with loss but now refers to the natural  processes within the system. These are the processes that ul­ timately lead the system to thermodynamic "equilibrium"  corresponding to the state of maximum entropy.  In Chapter I we emphasized the element of surprise in­ volved in the discovery of Newton's universal laws of dynam­ ics. Here also the element of surprise is apparent. When Sadi  Carnot formulated the laws of ideal thermal engines, he was  far from imagining that his work would lead to a conceptual  revolution in physics.  Reversible transfor mations belong to classical science in the  sense that they define the possibility of acting on a system, of  controlling it. The dynamic object could be controlled through  its initial conditions. Similarly , when defined in terms of its  reversible transformations, the thermod ynamic object may be  controlled through its boundary conditions: any system in  thermodynamic equilibrium whose temperature, volume, or  pressure are gradually changed passes through a series of  equilibrium states, and any reversal of the manipulation leads  to a return to its initial state. The reversible nature of such  change and controlling the object through its boundary condi­ tions are interdependent processes. In this context irrevers­ ibility is "negative"; it appears in the form of "uncontrolled"  changes that occur as soon as the system eludes control. But  inverse ly, irreversible processes may be considered as the last  remnants of the spontaneous and intrinsic activity displayed  by nature when experimental devices are employed to harness  it.  Thus the "negative" property of dissipation shows that, un­ like dynamic objects, thermodynamic objects can only be par­ tially controlled. Occasionally they "break loose" into  spontaneous change.  All changes are not equivalent for a thermod ynamic sys­ tem. This is the meaning of the expression dS =deS+ diS.  Spontaneous change toward equilibrium diS is different from  the change deS, which is determined and controlled by a mod­ ification of the boundary conditions (for example, ambient  temperature ). For an isolated system, equilibrium appears as </p><div id="pagenum"><p>153</p></div><p id="page">121 ENERGY AND THE INDUSTRIAL AGE  an ••attractor" of nonequilibrium states. Our initial assertion  may thus be generalized by saying that evolution toward an  attractor state differs from all other changes, especially from  changes determined by boundary conditions.  Max Planck often emphasized the difference between the  two types of change found in nature. Nature, wrote Planck,  seems to "favor" certain states. The irreversible increase in  entropy diS/dt describes a system's approach to a state which  "attracts" it, which the system prefers and from which it will  not move of its own "free will." "From this point of view, Na­ ture does not permit processes whose final states she finds  less attractive than their initial states. Reversible processes are  limiting cases. In them, Nature has an equal propensity for  initial and final states; this is why the passage between them  can be made in both directions. "20  How foreign such language sounds when compared with the  language of dynamics! In dynamics, a system changes accord­ ing to a trajectory that is given once and for all, whose starting  point is never forgotten (since initial conditions determine the  trajectory for all time). However, in an isolated system all non­ equilibrium situations produce evolution toward the same kind  of equilibrium state. By the time equilibrium has been  reached, the system has forgotten its initial conditions-that  is, the way it had been prepared.  Thus specific heat or the compressibility of a system in  equilibrium are properties independent of the way the system  has been set up. This fortunate circumstance greatly simplifies  the study of the physical states of matter. Indeed, complex  systems consist of an immense number of particles.* From the  dynamic standpoint it is practically impossible to reproduce  any state of such systems in view of the infinite variety of dy­ namic states that may occur.  We are now confronted with two ba�ically different descrip­ tions: dynamics, which applies to the world of motion, and  *Physical chemistry often employs Avogadro's number-that is, the num­ ber of molecules in a "mole" of matter (a mole always contains the same  number of particles, the number of atoms contained in one gram of hydro­ gen). This number is of the order of 6.1023, and it is the characteristic order  of magnitude of the number of particles forming systems governed by the  laws of classical thermodynamics. </p><div id="pagenum"><p>154</p></div><p id="page">ORDER OUT OF CHAOS 122  thermodynamics, the science of complex systems with its in­ trinsic direction of evolution toward increasing entropy. This  dichotomy immediately raises the question of how these de­ scriptions are related, a problem that has been debated since  the laws of thermodynamics were formulated.  Boltzmanns Order Principle  The second law of thermodynamics contains two fundamental  elements: ( 1) a "negati ve" one that expresses the impossibility  of certain processes (heat flows from the hot source to the cold  and not vice versa) and (2) a "positive," constructive one. The  second is a consequence of the first; it is the impossibility of  certain processes that permits us to introduce a function, en­ tropy, which increases uniformly for isolated systems. En­ tropy behaves as an attractor for isolated systems.  How could the formulations of thermodynamics be recon­ ciled with dynamics? At the end of the nineteenth century ,  most scientists seemed to think this was impossible. The prin­ ciples of thermodynamics were new laws forming the basis of a  new science that could not be reduced to traditional physics.  Both the qualitative diversity of energy and its tendency to­ ward dissipation had to be accepted as new axioms. This was  the argument of the "energeticists" as opposed to the "atom­ ists," who refused to abandon what they considered to be the  essential mission of physics-to reduce the complexity of nat­ ural phenomena to the simplicity of elementary behavior ex­ pressed by the laws of motion.  Actually, the problems of the transition from the micro­ scopic to the macroscopic level were to prove exceptionally  fruitful for the development of physics as a whole. Boltzmann  was the first to take up the challenge. He felt that new con­ cepts had to be developed to extend the physics of trajectories  to cover the situation described by thermodynamics. Follow­ ing in Maxwell's footsteps, Boltzmann sought this conceptual  innovation in the theory of probabilit y.  That probability could play a role in the description of com­ plex phenomena was not surprising: Maxwell himself appears </p><div id="pagenum"><p>155</p></div><p id="page">123 ENERGY AND THE INDUSTRIAL AGE  to have been influenced by the work of Quetelet, the inventor  of the "average" man in sociology . The innovation was to in­ troduce probability in physics not as a means of approxima­ tion but rather as an explanatory principle, to use it to show  that a system could display a new type of behavior by virtue of  its being composed of a large population to which the laws of  probability could be applied.  Let us consider a simple example of the application of the  concept of probability in physics. An ensemble composed of  N particles is contained in a box divided into two equal com­ partments. The problem is to find the probability of the  various possible distributions of particles between the com­ partments-that is, the probability of finding N1 particles in  the first compartment (and N2 = N-N1 in the second).  Using combinatorial analysis, it is easy to calculate the  number of ways in which each different distribution of N parti­ cles can be achieved. Thus if N = 8, there is only one way of  placing the eight particles in a single half. There are, however ,  eight different ways of putting one particle in one half and  seven in the other half, if we suppose the particles to be dis­ tinguishable, as is assumed in classical physics. Furthermore,  equal distribution of the eight particles between the two halves  can be carried out in 8!14!4! = 70 different ways (where  n!= 1·2·3 ... (n-l)·n) . Likewise, whatever the value of N, a  number P of situations called complexions in physics may be  defined, giving the number of ways of achieving any given dis­ tribution N1,N2• Its expression is P=N!IN1!N2!.  For any given population, the larger the number of complex­ ions the smaller the difference between N1 and N2• It is max­ imum when the population is equally distributed over the two  halves. Moreov er, the larger the value of N, the greater the  difference between the number of complexions corresponding  to the different ways of distribution. For values of N of the  order of 1Q23 values found in macroscopic systems, the over­ whelming majority of possible distributions corresponds to  the distribution N1 =N2=NI2. For systems composed of a  large number of particles, all states that differ from the state  corresponding to an equal distribution are thus highly im­ probable.  Boltzmann was the .first to realize that irreversible increase </p><div id="pagenum"><p>156</p></div><p id="page">ORDER OUT OF CHAOS 124  in entropy could be considered as the expression of a growing  molecular disorder , of the gradual forgetting of any initial dis­ symmetry , since dissymmetry decreases the number of com­ plexions when compared to the state corresponding to the  maximum of P. Boltzmann thus aimed to identify entropy S  with the number of complexions: entropy characterizes each  macroscopic state in terms of the number of ways of achieving  this state. Boltzmann's famous equation S = k lg pt expresses  this idea in quantitative form. The proportionality factor k in  this formula is a universal constant, known as Boltzmann's  constant.  Boltzmann's results signify that irreversible thermodynamic  change is a change toward states of increasing probability and  that the attractor state is a macroscopic state corresponding to  maximum probability . This takes us far beyond Newton. For  the first time a physical concept has been explained in terms of  probability . Its utility is immediately apparent. Probability can  adequately explain a system's forgetting of all initial dissym­ metry, of all special distributions (for example, the set of par­ ticles concentrated in a subregion of the system, or the  distribution of velocities that is created when two gases of dif­ ferent temperatures are mixed). This forgetting is possible be­ cause, whatever the evolution peculiar to the system, it will  ultimately lead to one of the microscopic states corresponding  to the macroscopic state of disorder and maximum symmetry ,  since these macroscopic states correspond to the overwhelm­ ing majority of possible microscopic states. Once this state  has been reached, the system will move only short distances  from the state, and for short periods of time. In other words,  the system will merely fluctuate around the attractor state.  Boltzmann's order principle implies that the most probable  state available to a system is the one in which the multitude of  events taking place simultaneously in the system compensates  for one another statistically. In the case of our first example,  whatever the initial distribution, the system's evolution will  ultimately lead it to the equal distribution N1 = N2• This state  will put an end to the system's irreversible macroscopic evolu- tThe logarithmic expression indicates that entropy is an additive quantity  (S 1 +2 = S 1 + S2), while the number of complexions is multiplicative  (PI +2 =PI· P2). </p><div id="pagenum"><p>157</p></div><p id="page">125 ENERGY AND THE INDUSTRIAL AGE  tion. Of course, the particles will go on moving from one half  to the other, but on the average, at any given instant, as many  will be going in one direction as in the other. As a result, their  motion will cause only small, short-lived fluctuations around  the equilibrium state N1 =N2• Boltzmann's probabilistic inter­ pretation thus makes it possible to understand the specificity  of the attractor studied by equilibrium thermodynamics.  This is not the whole story, and we shall devote the third  part of this book to a more detailed discussion. A few remarks  suffice here. In classical mechanics (and, as we shall see, in  quantum mechanics as well), everything is determined in  terms of initial states and the laws of motion. How then does  probability enter the description of nature? Here it is common  to invoke our ignorance of the exact dynamic state of the sys­ tem. This is the subjectivistic interpretation of entropy. Such  an interpretation was acceptable when irreversible processes  were considered to be mere nuisances corresponding to fric­ tion or, more generally, to losses in the functioning of thermal  engines. But today the situation has changed. As we shall see,  irreversible processes have an immense constructive impor­ tance: life would not be possible without them. The subjec­ tivistic interpretation is therefore highly questionable. Are we  ourselves merely the result of our ignorance, of the fact that  we only observe macroscopic states.  Moreover , both in thermodynamics as well as in its proba­ bilistic interpretation, there appears a dissymmetry in time:  entropy increases in the direction of the future, not of the past.  This seems impossible when we consider dynamic equations that  are invariant in respect to time inversion. As we shall see, the  second law is a selection principle compatible with dynamics  but not deducible from it. It limits the possible initial condi­ tions available to a dynamic system. The second law therefore  marks a radical departure from the mechanistic world of clas­ sical or quantum dynamics. Let us now return to Boltzmann's  work.  So far we have discussed isolated systems in which the num­ ber of particles as well as the total energy are fixed by the  boundary conditions. However , it is possible to extend  Boltzmann's explanation to open systems that interact with  their environment. In a closed system, defined by boundary  conditions such that its temperature Tis kept constant by heat </p><div id="pagenum"><p>158</p></div><p id="page">ORDER OUT OF CHAOS 126  exchange with the environment, equilibrium is not defined in  terms of maximum entropy but in terms of the minimum of a  similar function, free energy: F=E- TS, where E is the en­ ergy of the system and Tis the temperature (measured on the  so-called Kelvin scale, where the freezing point of water is  273°C and its boiling point is 373°C).  This formula signifies that equilibrium is the result of com­ petition between energy and entropy. Temperature is what  determines the relative weight of the two factors. At low  temperatures, energy prevails, and we have the formation of  ordered (weak-e ntropy) and low-energy structures such as  crystals. Inside these structures each molecule interacts with  its neighbors, and the kinetic energy involved is small com­ pared with the potential energy that results from the interac­ tions of each molecule with its neighbors. We can imagine  each particle as imprisoned by its interactions with its neigh­ bors. At high temperatures, however , entropy is dominant and  so is molecular disorder. The importance of relative motion  increases, and the regularity of the crystal is disrupted; as the  temperature increases, we first have the liquid state, then the  gaseous state.  The entropy S of an isolated system and the free energy F of  a system at fixed temperature are examples of "thermody­ namic potential s." The extremes of thermodynamic potentials  such as S or F define the attractor states toward which sys­ tems whose boundary conditions correspond to the definition  of these potentials tend spontaneously .  Boltzmann's principle can also be used to study the coexis­ tence of structures (such as the liquid phase and the solid  phase) or the equilibrium between a crystallized product and  the same product in solution. It is important to rememb er,  however , that equilibrium structures are defined on the mo­ lecular level. It is the interaction between molecules acting  over a range of the order of some to-s em, the same order of  magnitude as the diameter of atoms in molecules, that makes a  crystal structure stable and endows it with its macroscopic  properties. Crystal size, on the other hand, is not an intrinsic  property of structure. It depends on the quantity of matter in  the crystalline phase at equilibrium. </p><div id="pagenum"><p>159</p></div><p id="page">127 ENERGY AND THE INDUSTRIAL AGE  Carnot and Darwin  Equilibrium thermodynamics provides a satisfactory explana­ tion for a vast number of physicochemical phenomena. Yet it  may be asked whether the concept of equilibrium structures  encompasses the different structures we encounter in nature.  Obviously the answer is no.  Equilibrium structures can be seen as the results of statisti­ cal compensation for the activity of microscopic elements  (molecules, atoms). By definition they are inert at the global  level. For this reason they are also "immor tal." Once they  have been formed, they may be isolated and maintained indefi­ nitely without further interaction with their environment.  When we examine a biological cell or a city, however , the situa­ tion is quite different: not only are these systems open, but  also they exist only because they are open. They feed on the  flux of matter and energy coming to them from the outside  world. We can isolate a crystal, but cities and cells die when  cut off from their environment. They form an integral part of  the world from which they draw sustenance, and they cannot  be separated from the fluxes that they incessantly transform.  However , it is not only living nature that is profound ly alien  to the models of thermodynamic equilibrium. Hydrodynamics  and chemical reactions usually involve exchanges of matter  and energy with the outside world.  It is difficult to see how Boltzmann's order principle can be  applied to such situations. The fact that a system becomes  more uniform in the course of time can be understood in terms  of complexions; in a state of uniformi ty, when the "differ­ ences" created by the initial conditions have been forgotten,  the number of complexions will be maximum. But it is impos­ sible to understand spontaneous convection from this point of  view. The convection current calls for coherence, for the co­ operation of a vast number of molecules. It is the opposite of  disorder , a privileged state to which only a comparatively  small number of complexions may correspond. In Boltz­ mann's terms, it is an "improbable" state. If convection must  be considered a "miracle,·· what then is there to say about life, </p><div id="pagenum"><p>160</p></div><p id="page">ORDER OUT OF CHAOS 128  with its highly specific features present in the simplest orga­ nisms?  The question of the relevance of equilibr ium models can be re­ versed. In order to produce equilibrium, a system must be  "protected" from the fluxes that compose nature. It must be  "canned," so to speak, or put in a bottle, like the homunculus  in Goethe's Faust, who addresses to the alchemist who cre­ ated him: "Come, press me tenderly to your breast, but not  too hard, for fear the glass might break. This is the way things  are: something natural, the whole world hardly suffices what  is, but what is artificial demands a closed space." In the world  that we are familiar with, equilibrium is a rare and precarious  state. Even evolution toward equilibrium implies a world like  ours, far enough away from the sun for the partial isolation of a  system to be conceivable (no "canning" is possible at the tem­ perature of the sun), but a world in which nonequilibrium re­ mains the rule, a "lukewarm" world where equilibrium and  nonequilibrium coexist.  For a long time, however , physicists thought they could de­ fine the inert structure of crystals as the only physical order  that is predictable and reproducible and approach equilibrium  as the only evolution that could be deduced from the funda­ mental laws of physics. Thus any attempt at extrapolation  from thermodynamic descriptions was to define as rare and  unpredictable the kind of evolution described by biology and  the social sciences. How, for example, could Darwinian evolu­ tion-the statistical selection of rare events-be reconciled  with the statistical disappearance of all peculiarities, of all rare  configurations, described by Boltzmann? As Roger Caillois2 1  asks: "Can Carnot and Darwin both be right?"  It is interesting to note how similar in essence the Darwinian  approach is to the path explored by Boltzmann. This may be  more than a coincidence. We know that Boltzmann had im­ mense admiration for Darwin. Darwin 's theory begins with an  assumption of the spontaneous fluctuations of species; then  selection leads to irreversible biological evolution. Therefore,  as with Boltzmann, a randomness leads to irreversib ility. Yet  the result is very different. Boltzmann's interpretation implies  the forgetting of initial conditions, the "destruction" of initial  structures, while Darwinian evolution is associated with self­ organization, ever-increasing complexi ty. </p><div id="pagenum"><p>161</p></div><p id="page">129 ENERGY AND THE INDUSTRIA L AGE  To sum up our argument so far, equilibrium thermodynam­ ics was the first response of physics to the problem of nature's  complexi ty. This response was expressed in terms of the dissipa­ tion of energy, the forgetting of initial conditions, and evolu­ tion toward disorder. Classical dynamics, the science of eternal,  reversible trajectories, was alien to the problems facing the  nineteenth century , which was dominated by the concept of  evolution. Equilibrium thermodynamics was in a position to  oppose its view of time to that of other sciences: for thermody­ namics, time implies degradation and death. As we have seen,  Diderot had already asked the question: Where do we, orga­ nized beings endowed with sensations, fit in an inert world  subject to dynamics? There is another question, which has  plagued us for more than a century: What significance does  the evolution of a living being have in the world described by  thermodynamics, a world of ever-increasing disorder? What is  the relationship between thermodynamic time, a time headed  toward equilibrium, and the time in which evolution toward  increasing complexity is occurring?  Was Bergson right? Is time the very medium of innovation,  or is it nothing at all? </p><div id="pagenum"><p>162</p></div><p id="page"></p><div id="pagenum"><p>163</p></div><p id="page">CHAPTERV  THE THREE STAGES  OF THERMODYNAMICS  Flux and Force  Let us return I to the description of the second law given in the  previous chapter. The concept of entropy plays a central role  in the description of evolution. As we have seen, its variation  can be written as the sum of two terms-the term deS, linked  to the exchanges between the system and the rest of the world,  and a production term, diS, resulting from irreversible phe­ nomena inside the system. This term is always positive except  at thermodynamic equilibrium, when it becomes zero. For iso­ lated systems (deS= 0), the equilibrium state corresponds to a  state of maximum entropy.  In order to appreciate the significance of the second law for  physics, we need a more detailed description of the various  irreversible phenomena involved in the entropy production diS  or in the entropy production per unit time P=diS/dt.  For us chemical reactions are of particular significance. To­ gether with heat conduction, they form the prototype of irre­ versible processes. In addition to their intrinsic importance,  chemical processes play a fundamental role in biology . The  living cell presents an incessant metabolic activity. There  thousands of chemical reactions take place simultaneously to  transform the matter the cell feeds on, to synthesize the fun­ damental biomolecules, and to eliminate waste products. As  regards both the different reaction rates and the reaction sites  within the cell, this chemical activity is highly coordinated.  The biological structure thus combines order and activity . In  contrast, an equilibrium state remains inert even though it may  be structured, as, for example, with a crystal. Can chemical  131 </p><div id="pagenum"><p>164</p></div><p id="page">ORDER OUT OF CHAOS 132  processes provide us with the key to the difference between  the behavior of a crystal and that of a cell?  We will have to consider chemical reactions from a dual  point of view, both kinetic and thermodynamic.  From the kinetic point of view, the fundamental quantity is the  reaction rate. The classical theory of chemical kinetics is  based on the assumption that the rate of a chemical reaction is  proportional to the concentrations of the products taking part  in it. Indeed, it is through collisions between molecules that a  reaction takes place, and it is quite natural to assume that the  number of collisions is proportional to the product of the con­ centrations of the reacting molecules.  For the sake of example, let us take a simple reaction such  as A + X �B + Y. This "reaction equation" means that when­ ever a molecule of component A encounters a molecule of X,  there is a certain probability that a reaction will take place and  a molecule of B and a molecule of Y will be produced. A colli­ sion producing such a change in the molecules involved is a  "reactive collision." Only a usually very small fraction (for  example, 111 (6) of all collisions are of this kind. In most cases,  the molecules retain their original nature and merely exchange  energy.  Chemical kinetics deals with changes in the concentration  of the different products involved.in a reaction. This kinetics is  described by differential equations, just as motion is described  by the Newtonian equations. However , in this case, we are not  calculating acceleration but the rates of change of con­ centration, and these rates are expressed as a function of the  concentrations of the reactants. The rate of change of con­ centration of X, dXldt, is thus proportional to the product of  the concentrations of A and X in the solution-that is,  dXldt= -kA'X, where k is a proportionality factor that is  linked to quantities such as temperature and pressure and that  provides a measure for the fraction of reactive collisions tak­ ing place and leading to the reaction A + X � Y + B. Since, in  the example taken, whenever a molecule of X disappears, a  molecule of A disappears too, and a molecule of Yand one of  B are formed, the rates of change of concentration are related:  dXldt=dA ldt= -dYldt= -dBldt.  But if the collision between a molecule of X and a molecule </p><div id="pagenum"><p>165</p></div><p id="page">133 THE THREE STAGES OF THERMODYNAMICS  of A can set off a chemical reaction, the collision between mol­ ecules of Y and B can set off the opposite reaction. A second  reaction Y + B-.X +A thus occurs within the system de­ scribed, bringing about a supplementary variation in the con­ centration of X, dX/dt = k' YB. The total variatio n in  concentration of a chemical compound is given by the balance  between the forward and the reverse reaction. In our example,  dX/dt (= -dY/dt= ... )= -kAX+k'YB.  If left to itself, a system in which chemical reactions occur  tends toward a state of chemical equilibrium. Chemical equi­ librium is therefore a typical example of an "attractor" state.  Whatever its initial chemical composition, the system spon­ taneously reaches this final stage, where the forward and re­ verse reactions compensate one another statistically so that  there is no longer any overall variation in the concentrations  (dX/dt=O). This compensation implies that the ratio between  equilibrium concentrations is given by AXIYB= k'lk=K. This  result is known as the "law of mass action," or Guldberg and  Waage's law, and K is the equilibrium constant. The ratio be­ tween concentrations determined by the law of mass action  corresponds to chemical equilibrium in the same way that uni­ formity of temperature (in the case of an isolated system) cor­ responds to thermal equilibrium. The corresponding entropy  production vanishes.  Before we deal with the thermodynamic description of  chemical reactions, let us briefly consider an additional aspect  of the kinetic description. The rate of chemical reactions is  affected not only by the concentrations of the reacting mole­ cules and thermodynamic parameters (for example, pressure  and temperature) but also may be affected by the presence in  the system of chemical substances that modify the reaction  rate without themselves being changed in the process. Sub­ stances of this kind are known as "catalysts ." Catalysts can,  for instance, modify the value of the kinetic constants k or k'  or even allow the system to follow a new "reaction path." In  biology , this role is played by specific proteins, the "en­ zymes." These macromolecules have a spatial configuration  that allows them to modify the rate of a given reaction. Often  they are highly specific and affect only one reaction. A possi­ ble mechanism for the catalytic effect of enzymes is to present </p><div id="pagenum"><p>166</p></div><p id="page">ORDER OUT OF CHAOS 134  different "reaction sites" to which the different molecules in­ volwd in the reaction tend to attach themselves, thus increas­ ing the likelihood of their coming into contact and reacting.  One very important type of catalysis, particularly in biol­ ogy, is the one in which the presence of a product is required  for its own synthesis. In other words, in order to produce the  molecule X we must begin with a system already containing X.  Very frequently , for instance, the molecule X activates an en­ zyme. By attaching itself to the enzyme it stabilizes that par­ ticular configuration in which the reaction site is available. To  such an autocatalysis process correspond reaction schemes  such as A+ 2X � 3X; in the presence of molecules X, a mole­ cule A is converted into a molecule X. Therefore we need X to  produce more X. This reaction may be symbolized by the re­ action "loop":  A  One important feature of systems involving such "reaction  loops" is that the kinetic equations describing the changes oc­ curring in them are nonlinear differential equations .  . If we apply the same method as above, the kinetic equation  obtained for the reaction A+ 2X �3X is dX/dt = kA)(2, where  the rate of variation of the concentration of X is proportional  to the square of its concentration.  Another very important class of catalytic reactions in biol­ ogy is that of crosscatalysis-for example, 2X + Y�3X, B +X  � Y + D, which may be represented by the loop of Figure 3.  This is a case of crosscatalysis, since X is produced from Y,  and simultaneously Y from X. Catalysis does not necessarily  increase the reaction rate; it may, on the contrary , lead to inhi­ bition, which can also be represented by suitable feedback  loops.  The peculiar mathematical properties of the nonlinear dif­ ferential equations describing chemical processes with cata­ lytic steps are vitally important, as we shall see later, for the  thermodynamics of far-from-equilibrium chemical processes.  In addition, as we have already mentioned, molecular biology </p><div id="pagenum"><p>167</p></div><p id="page">135 THE THREE STAGES OF THERMODYNAMICS  ,..... ... ��------£ a A -.x  D e.x -.v.o  or 2.X•V -..Jx  x-.E  Figure 3. This graph represents the reaction paths for the "Brusselator"  reactions, which are further described in the text.  has established that these loops play an essential role in meta­ bolic functions. For example, the relation between nucleic  acids and proteins can be described in terms of a crosscata­ lytic effect: nucleic acids contain the information to produce  proteins, which in turn produce nucleic acids.  In addition to the rates of chemical reactions, we must also  consider the rates of other irreversible processes, such as heat  transfer and the diffusion of matter. The rates of irreversible  processes are also called fluxes and are denoted by the symbol  J. There is no general theory from which we can derive the  form of the rates or fluxes. In chemical reactions the rate de­ pends on the molecular mechanism, as can be verified by the  examples already indicated. The thermodynamics of irreversi­ ble processes introduces a second type of quantity: in addition  to the rates, or fluxes, J, it uses "generalized forces," X, that  "cause" the fluxes. The simplest example is that of heat con­ duction. Fourier's law tells us that the heat flux J is propor­ tional to the temperature gradient. This temperature gradient  is the "force" causing the heat flux. By definition, flux and  forces both vanish at thermal equilibrium. As we shall see, the  production of entropy P=diS/dt can be calculated from the  flux and the forces.  Let us consider the definition of the generalized force corre­ sponding to a chemical reaction. Recall the reaction A+ X </p><div id="pagenum"><p>168</p></div><p id="page">ORDER OUT OF CHAOS 136  -+ Y +B. We have seen how, at equilibrium, the ratio between  concentrations is given by the law of mass action. As The­ ophile De Donder has shown, a "chemical force" can be intro­ duced, the "affinity" a that determines the direction of the  chemical reaction rate just as the temperature gradient deter­ mines the direction in which heat will flow. In the case of the  reaction we are considering, the affinity is proportional to log  KB YIAX, where K is the equilibrium constant. It is immedi­ ately apparent that the affinity a vanishes at equilibrium  where, following the law of mass action, we have AXIBY=K.  The affinity increases (in absolute value) when we drive the  system away from equilibrium. We can see this if we eliminate  from the system a fraction of the molecules B once they are  formed through the reaction A +X-+ Y +B. Affinity can be said  to measure the distance between the actual state of the system  and its equilibrium state. Moreov er, as we have mentioned, its  sign determines the direction of the chemical reaction. If a is  positive, then there are "too many" molecules B and Y, and  the net reaction proceeds in the direction B + Y -+A+ X. On the  contrary , if a is negative there are "too few" B and Y, and the  net reaction proceeds in the opposite direction.  Affinity as we have defined it is a way of rendering more  precise the ancient affinity described by the alchemists, who  deciphered the elective· relationships between chemical  bodies-that is, the "likes" and "dislikes" of molecules. The  idea that chemical activity cannot be reduced to mechanical  trajectories, to the calm domination of dynamic laws, has been  emphasized from the beginning. We could cite Diderot at  length. Later, Nietzsche, in a different context, asserted that it  was ridiculous to speak of "chemical laws," as though chemi­ cal bodies were governed by laws similar to moral laws. In  chemistry , he protested, there is no constraint, and each body  does as it pleases. It is not a matter of "respect" but of a power  struggle, of the ruthless domination of the weaker by the  stronger .2 Chemical equilibrium, with vanishing affinity, corre­ sponds to the resolution of this conflict. Seen from this point  of view, the specificity of thermodynamic affinity thus re­ phrases an age-old problem in modern language,3 the problem  of the distinction between the legal and indifferent world of  dynamic law, and the world of spontaneous and productive  activity to which chemical reactions belong. </p><div id="pagenum"><p>169</p></div><p id="page">137 THE THREE STAGES OF THERMODYNAMICS  Let us emphasize the basic conceptual distinction between  physics and chemistry . In classical physics we can at least  conceive of reversible processes such as the motion of a fric­ tionless pendulum. To neglect irreversible processes in dy­ namics always corresponds to an idealization, but, at least in  some cases, it is a meaningful one. The situation in chemistry  is quite different. Here the processes that define chemistry­ chemical transformations characterized by reaction rates­ are irreversible. For this reason chemistry cannot be reduced  to the idealization that lies at the basis of classical or quantum  mechanics, in which past and future play equivalent roles.  As could be expected, all possible irreversible processes ap­ pear in entropy production. Each of them enters through the  product of its rate or flux J multiplied by the corresponding  force X. The total entropy production per unit time, P= diS/dt,  is the sum of these contributions. Each of them appears  through the product JX.  We can divide thermodynamics into three large fields, the  study of which corresponds to three successive stages in its  development. Entropy production, the fluxes, and the forces  are all zero at equilibrium. In the close-to-eq uilibrium region,  where thermodynamic forces are "weak," the rates Jk are lin­ ear functions of the forces. The third field is called the "non­ linear" region, since in it the rates are in general more  complicated functions of the forces. Let us first emphasize  some general features of linear thermodynamics that apply to  close-to-equilibrium situations.  Linear Thermodynamics  In 1931, Lars Onsager discovered the first general relations  in nonequilibrium thermodynamics for the linear, near-to­ equilibr ium region. These are the famous "reciprocity rela­ tions." In qualitative terms, they state that if a force- say,  "one" (corresponding, for example, to a temperature gra­ dient)-may influence a flux "two" (for example, a diffusion  process), then force "two" (a concentration gradient) will also  influence the flux .. one .. (the heat flow). This has indeed been  verified. For example, in each case where a thermal gradient </p><div id="pagenum"><p>170</p></div><p id="page">ORDER OUT OF CHAOS 138  induces a process of diffusion of matter, we find that a con­ centration gradient can set up a heat flux through the system.  The general nature of Onsager's relations has to be empha­ sized. It is immaterial, for instance, whether the irreversible  processes take place in a gaseous, liquid, or solid medium.  The reciprocity expressions are valid independently of any mi­ croscopic assumptions.  Reciprocity relations have been the first results in the ther­ modynamics of irreversible processes to indicate that this was  not some ill-defined no-man 's-tand but a worthwhile subject of  study whose fertility could be compared with that of equi­ librium thermodynamics. Equilibrium thermodynamics was  an achievement of the nineteenth century , nonequilibrium  thermodynamics was developed in the twentieth century , and  Onsager's relations mark a crucial point in the shift of interest  away from equilibrium toward nonequilibrium.  A second general result in this field of linear, nonequilib­ rium thermodynamics bears mention here. We have already  spoken of thermodynamic potentials whose extrema correspond  to the states of equilibrium toward which thermodynamic evo­ lution tends irreversibly. Such are the entropy S for is<.'lated  systems, and the free energy F for closed systems at a given  temperature. The thermodynamics of close-to-equilibrium  systems also introduces such a potential function. It is quite  remarkable that this potential is the entropy-production P it­ self. The theorem of minimum entropy production does, in  fact, show that in the range of validity of Onsager's relations­ that is, the linear region-a system evolves toward a stationary  state characterized by the minimum entropy production com­ patible with the constraints imposed upon the system. These  contraints are determined by the boundary conditions. They  may, for instance, correspond to two points in the system kept  at different temperatures, or to a flux of matter that continu­ ously suppor ts a reaction and eliminates its products.  The stationary state toward which the system evolves is  then necessarily a nonequilibrium state at which dissipative  processes with nonvanishing rates occur. But since it is a sta­ tionary state, all the quantities that describe the system, such  as temperature concentrations, become time-independent.  Similarly, the entropy of the system now becomes independent </p><div id="pagenum"><p>171</p></div><p id="page">139 THE THREE STAGES OF THERMODYNAMICS  of time. Therefore its time variation dS = 0 vanishes. But we  have seen that the time variation of entropy is made up of two  terms-the entropy flow deS and the positive entropy produc­ tion diS. Therefore, dS=O implies that deS= -diS<O. The  heat or matter flux coming from the environment determines a  negative flow of entropy deS, which is, however , matched by  the entropy production diS due to irreversible processes inside  the system. A negative flux deS means that the system trans­ fers entropy to the outside world. Therefore at the stationary  state, the system's activity continuously increases the entropy  of its environment. This is true for all stationary states. But  the theorem of minimum entropy production says more. The  particular stationary state toward which the system tends is  the one in which this transfer of entropy to the environment is  as small as is compatible with the imposed boundary condi­ tions. In this context, the equilibrium state corresponds to the  special case that occurs when the boundary conditions allow a  vanishing entropy production. In other words, the theory of  minimum entropy production expresses a kind of "inertia."  When the boundary conditions prevent the system from going  to equilibrium it does the next best thing; it goes to a state of  minimum entropy production-that is, to a state as close to  equilibrium as "possibl e."  Linear thermodynamics thus describes the stable, predict­ able behavior of systems tending toward the minimum level of  activity compatible with the fluxes that feed them. The fact  that linear thermodynamics, like equilibrium thermodynam­ ics, may be described in terms of a potential, the entropy pro­ duction, implies that, both in evolution toward equilibrium and  in evolution toward a stationary state, initial conditions are  forgotten. Whatever the initial conditions, the system will fi­ nally reach the state determined by the imposed boundary  conditions. As a result, the reaction of such a system to any  change in its boundary conditions is entirely predictable.  We see that in the linear range the situation remains  basically the same as at equilibrium. Although the entropy  production does not vanish, neither does it prevent the irrever­ sible change from being identified as an evolution toward a  state that is wholly deducible from general laws. This "becom ­ ing .. inescapably leads to the destruction of any difference, </p><div id="pagenum"><p>172</p></div><p id="page">ORDER OUT OF CHAOS 140  any specificity. Carnot or Darwin? The paradox mentioned in  Chapter IV remains. There is still no connection between the  appearance of natural organized forms on one side, and on the  other the tendency toward "forgetting" of initial conditions,  along with the resulting disorganization.  Far "from Equilibrium  At the root of nonlinear thermodynamics lies something quite  surprising, something that first appeared to be a failure: in  spite of much effort, the generalization of the theorem of mini­ mum entropy production for systems in which the fluxes are  no longer linear functions of the forces appeared impossible.  Far from equilibrium, the system may still evolve to some  steady state, but in general this state can no longer be charac­ terized in terms of some suitably chosen potential (such as  entropy production for near-equilibrium states).  The absence of any potential function raises a new question:  What can we say about the stability of the states toward which  the system evolves? Indeed, as long as the attractor state is  defined by the minimum of a potential such as the entropy  production, its stability is guaranteed. It is true that a fluctua­ tion may shift the system away from this minimum. The sec­ ond law of thermodynamics, however, imposes the return  toward the attractor. The system is thus "immune" with re­ spect to fluctuations. Thus whenever we define a potential, we  are describing a "stable world" in which systems follow an  evolution that leads them to a static situation that is estab­ lished once and for all.  When the thermodynamic forces acting on a system become  such that the linear region is exceeded, however, the stability  of the stationary state, or its independence from fluctuations,  can no longer be taken for granted. Stability is no longer the  consequence of the general laws of physics. We must examine  the way a stationary state reacts to the different types of fluc­ tuation produced by the system or its environment. In some  cases, the analysis leads to the conclusion that a state is "un­ stable"-in such a state, certain fluctuations, instead of re-</p><div id="pagenum"><p>173</p></div><p id="page">141 THE THREE STAGES OF THERMODYNAMICS  gressing, may be amplified and invade the entire system,  compelling it to evolve toward a new regime that may be  qualitatively quite different from the stationary states corre­ sponding to minimum entropy production.  Thermodynamics leads to an initial general conclusion con­ cerning systems that are liable to escape the type of order gov­ erning equilibrium. These systems have to be "far from  equilibrium." In cases where instability is possible, we have to  ascertain the threshold, the distance from equilibrium, at  which fluctuations may lead to new behavior, different from  the "normal" stable behavior characteristic of equilibrium or  near-equilibrium systems.  Why is this conclusion so interesting?  Phenomena of this kind are well known in the field of hydro­ dynamics and fluid flow. For instance, it has long been known  that once a certain flow rate of flux has been reached, tur­ bulence may occur in a fluid. Michel Serres has recently re­ called4 that the early atomists were so concerned about  turbulent flow that it seems legitimate to consider turbulence  as a basic source of inspiration of Lucretian physics. Some­ times, wrote Lucretius, at uncertain times and places, the  eternal, universal fall of the atoms is disturbed by a very slight  deviati0n-the "clinamen ." The resulting vortex gives rise to  the world, to all natural things. The clinamen, this spon­ taneous, unpredictable deviation, has often been criticized as  one of the main weaknesses of Lucretian physics, as being  something introduced ad hoc. In fact, the contrary is true­ the clinamen attempts to explain events such as laminar flow  ceasing to be stable and spontaneously turning into turbulent  flow. Today hydrodynamic experts test the stability of fluid  flow by introducing a perturbation that expresses the effect of  molecular disorder added to the average flow. We are not so far  from the clinamen of Lucretius!  For a long time turbulence was identified with disorder or  noise. Today we know that this is not the case. Indeed, while  turbulent motion appears as irregular or chaotic on the mac­ roscopic scale, it is, on the contrary , highly organized on the  microscopic scale. The multiple space and time scales in­ volved in turbulence correspond to the coherent behavior of  millions and millions of molecules. Viewed in this way, the  transition from laminar flow to turbulence is a process of self-</p><div id="pagenum"><p>174</p></div><p id="page">ORDER OUT OF CHAOS 142  organization. Part of the energy of the system, which in lami­ nar flow was in the thermal motion of the molecules, is being  transferred to macroscopic organized motion.  The "Benard instability" is another striking example of the  instability of a stationary state giving rise to a phenomenon of  spontaneous self-organization. The instability is due to a verti­ cal temperature gradient set up in a horizontal liquid layer. The  lower surface of the latter is heated to a given temperature,  which is higher than that of the upper surface. As a result of  these boundary conditions, a permanent heat flux is set up,  moving from the bottom to the top. When the imposed gra­ dient reaches a threshold value, the fluid's state of rest-the  stationary state in which heat is conveyed by conduction  alone, without convection-becomes unstable. A convection  corresponding to the coherent motion of ensembles of mole­ cules is produced, increasing the rate of heat transfer. There­ fore, for given values of the constraints (the gradient of  temperature), the entropy production of the system is in­ creased; this contrasts with the theorem of minimum entropy  production. The Benard instability is a spectacular phe­ nomenon. The convection motion produced actually consists  of the complex spatial organization of the system. Millions of  molecules move coherently , forming hexagonal convection  cells of a characteristic size.  In Chapter IV we introduced Boltzmann's order principle,  which relates entropy to probability as expressed by the num­ ber of complexions P. Can we apply this relation here? To each  distribution of the velocities of the molecules corresponds a  number of complexions. This number measures the number of  ways in which we can realize the velocity distribution by at­ tributing some velocity to each molecule. The argument runs  parallel to that in Chapter IV, where we expressed the number  of complexions in terms of the distributions of molecules be­ tween two boxes. Here also the number of complexions is  large when there is disorder-that is, a wide dispersion of ve­ locities. In contrast, coherent motion means that many mole­ cules travel with nearly the same speed (small dispersion of  velocities). To such a distribution corresponds a number of  complexions P so low that there seems almost no chance for  the phenomenon of self-organization to occur. Yet it occurs!  We see, therefore, that calculating the number of complexions, </p><div id="pagenum"><p>175</p></div><p id="page">1-43 THE THREE STAGES OF THERMODYNAMICS  which entails the hypothesis of an equal a priori probability for  each molecular state, is misleading. Its irrelevance is par­ ticularly obvious as far as the genesis of the new behavior is  concerned. In the case of the Benard instability it is a fluctua­ tion, a microscopic convection current, which would have  been doomed to regression by the application of Boltzmann's  order principle, but which on the contrary is amplified until it  invades the whole system. Beyond the critical value of the im­ posed gradient, a new molecular order has thus been produced  spontaneously . It corresponds to a giant fluctuation stabilized  through energy exchanges with the outside world.  In far-from-equilibrium conditions, the concept of proba­ bility that underlies Boltzmann's order principle is no longer  valid in that the structures we observe do not correspond to a  maximum of complexions. Neither can they be related to a  minimum of the free energy F = E-TS. The tendency toward  leveling out and forgetting initial conditions is no longer a gen­ eral property. In this context, the age-old problem of the origin  cf life appears in a different perspective. It is certainly true that  life is incompatible with Boltzmann's order principle but not with  the kind of behavior that can occur in far-from-equilibrium  conditions.  Classical thermodynamics leads to the concept of "equi­ librium structu res" such as crystals. Benard cells are struc­ tures too, but of a quite different nature. That is why we have  introduced the notion of "dissipative structures," to empha­ size the close association, at first paradoxical, in such situa­ tions between structu re and order on the one side, and  dissipation or waste on the other. We have seen in Chapter IV  that heat transfer was considered a source of waste in classical  thermodynamics. In the Benard cell it becomes a source of  order.  The interaction of a system with the outside world, its em­ bedding in nonequilibrium conditions, may become in this way  the starting point for the formation of new dynamic states of  matter-dissipative structures. Dissipative structures actually  correspond to a form of supramolecular organization. Al­ though the parameters describing crystal structures may be  derived from the properties of the molecules of which they are  composed, and in particular from the range of their forces of  attraction and repulsion, Benard cells, like all dissipative </p><div id="pagenum"><p>176</p></div><p id="page">ORDER OUT OF CHAOS 144  structures, are essentially a reflection of the global situation of  nonequilibrium producing them. The parameters describing  them are macroscopic; they are not of the order of 10-8 cm,  like the distance between the molecules of a crystal, but of the  order of centimeters. Similarly , the time scales are different­ they correspond not to molecular times (such as periods of  vibration of individual molecules, which may correspond to  about 10-15 sec) but to macroscopic times: seconds, minutes,  or hours.  Let us return to the case of chemical reactions. There are  some fundamental differences from the Benard problem. In  the Benard cell the instability has a simple mechanical origin.  When we heat the liquid layer from below, the lower part of the  fluid becomes less dense, and the center of gravity rises. It is  therefore not surprising that beyond a critical point the system  tilts and convection sets in.  But in chemical systems there are no mechanical features of  this type. Can we expect any self-organization? Our mental  image of chemical reactions corresponds to molecules speed­ ing through space, colliding at random in a chaotic way. Such  an image leaves no place for self-organization, and this may be  one of the reasons why chemical instabilities have only re­ cently become a subject of interest. There is also another dif­ ference. All flows become turbulent at a "sufficiently" large  distance from equilibrium (the threshold is measured by di­ mensionless numbers such as Reynolds' number). This is not  true for chemical reactions. Being far from equilibrium is a  necessary requirement but not a sufficient one. For many  chemical systems, whatever the constraints imposed and the  rate of the chemical changes produced, the stationary state  remains stable and arbitrary fluctuations are damped, as is the  case in the close-to-equilibrium range. This is true in particu­ lar of systems in which we have a chain of transfor mations of  the type A-+B-+C-+D ... and that may be described by linear  differential equations.  The fate of the fluctuations perturbing a chemical system,  as well as the kinds of new situations to which it may evolve,  thus depend on the detailed mechanism of the chemical re­ actions. In contrast with close-to-equilibrium situations, the  behavior of a far-from-equilibrium system becomes highly spe­ cific. There is no longer any universally valid law from which </p><div id="pagenum"><p>177</p></div><p id="page">145 THE THREE STAGES OF THERMODYNAMICS  the overall behavior of the system can be deduced. Each sys­ tem is a separate case; each set of chemical reactions must be  investigated and may well produce a qualitatively different be­ havior.  Nevertheless, one general result has been obtained, namely  a necessary condition for chemical instability: in a chain of  chemical reactions occurring in the system, the only reaction  stages that, under certain conditions and circumstances, may  jeopardize the stability of the stationary state are precisely the  "catalytic loops"-stages in which the product of a chemical  reaction is involved in its own synthesis. This is an interesting  conclusion, since it brings us closer to some of the fundamen­ tal achievements of modern molecular biology (see Figure 4).  X  Figure 4. Catalytic loops correspond to nonlinear terms. In the case of a  one-independent-variable problem, this means the occurrence of at least  one term where the independent variable appears with a power higher than  1; in this simple case, it is easy to see the relation between such nonlinear  terms and the potential instability of stationary states.  Let us take for the independent variable X the time evolution dXIdt= f(X). It  is always possible to decompose f(X) in two functions representing a gain  and a loss f +(X) and f _(X), each of which is positive or 0, such that  f(X) = f +(X)-f _(X). In this way, stationary states (dX!dt= 0) correspond to  values where f +(X)= f _(X).  Those states are graphically given by the intersections of the two graphs  plotting f + and f _. If f + and f _ are linear, there can only be one intersection.  In other cases, the type of the intersection permits us to infer the stability of  the stationary state.  Four cases are possible:  Sl: stable with respect to negative fluctuations, unstable with respect to  positive ones: If the system deviates slightly to the left of Sl, the positive  difference between f + and f _ will reduce this deviation back to Sl; deviations  to the right will be amplified.  SS: stable with respect to positive and negative fluctuations.  IS: stable only with respect to positive fluctuations.  II: unstable with respect to positive and negative fluctuations. </p><div id="pagenum"><p>178</p></div><p id="page">ORDER OUT 0� CHAOS 146  Beyond the Threshold of Chemical Instability  Today the study of chemical instabilities is common. Both the­ oretical and experimental work are being pursued in a large  number of institutions and laboratories. Indeed, as will be­ come clear, these investigations are of interest to a wide range  of scientists-not only to mathematicians, physicists, chem­ ists, and biologists, but also to economists and sociologists.  In far-from-equilibrium conditions various new phenomena  appear beyond the threshold of chemical instability . To de­ scribe them in a concrete fashion, it is useful to start with a  simplified theoretical model, one that has been developed at  Brussels during the past decade. American scientists have  called this model the "Brusselator ," and this name is used in  scientific literature (Geographical associations seem to have  become the rule in this field; in addition to the Brusselator ,  there is an "Oregonator ," and most recently a "Palo­ altonator" !). Let us briefly describe the Brussela tor. The steps  responsible for instability have already been noted (see Figure  3). The product X, synthetized from A and broken down into  the form of E, is linked by a relationship of crosscatalysis to  produce Y. X is produced from Y during a trimolecular step  but, conver sely, Y is synthetized by a reaction between X and  a product B.  In this model, the concentrations of the products A, B, D, and  E are given parameters (the "control substances"). The behav­ ior of the system is explored for increasing values of B, with A  remaining constant. The stationary state toward which such a  system is likely to evolve-the state for which dX/dt = dY/dt  = 0-corresponds to concentrations X0 =A and Y0 = BIA. This  can be easily verified by writing the kinetic equations and  looking for the stationary state. However , this stationary state  ceases to be stable as soon as the concentration of B exceeds a  critical threshold (everything else being kept equal). After the  critical threshold has been reached, the stationary state be­ comes an unstable "focus" and the system leaves this focus to  reach a "limit cycle." </p><div id="pagenum"><p>179</p></div><p id="page">0 147 THE THREE STAGES OF THERMODYNAMICS  2 3 4 y  Figure 5. This scheme represents concentration of component X vs. con­ centration of component Y. The cycle's focus (point S) is the stationary state,  which is unstable for 8>(1 + A2). All the trajectories (of which five are plot­ ted), whatever their intitial state, lead to the same cycle.  Instead of remaining stationary , the concentrations of X and Y  begin to oscillate with a well-defined periodicity. The oscilla­ tion period depends both on the kinetic constants characteriz­ ing the reaction rates and the boundary conditions imposed on  the system as a whole (temperature, concentration of A., B,  etc.).  Beyond the critical threshold the system spontaneously  leaves the stationary state X0=A, Y0=BIA as the result of  fluctuations. Whatever the initial conditions, it approaches the  limit cycle, the periodic behavior of which is stable. We there­ fore have a periodic chemical process-a chemical clock. Let  us pause a moment to emphasize how unexpected such a phe­ nomenon is. Suppose we have two kinds of molecules, "red"  and "blue." Because of the chaotic motion of the molecules,  we would expect that at a given moment we would have more  red molecules, say, in the left part of a vessel. Then a bit later  more blue molecules would appear, and so on. The vessel  would appear to us as "violet," with occasional irregular </p><div id="pagenum"><p>180</p></div><p id="page">ORDER OUT OF CHAOS 148  flashes of red or blue. However, this is not what happens with  a chemical clock; here the system is all blue, then it abruptly  changes its col or to red, then again to blue. Because all these  changes occur at regular time intervals, we have a coherent  process.  Such a degree of order stemming from the activity ofbiIlions  of molecules seems incredible, and indeed, if chemical clocks  had not been observed, no one would believe that such a pro­ cess is possible. To change color all at once, molecules must  have a way to "communica te." The system has to act as a  whole. We will return repeatedly to this key word, communi­ cate, which is of obvious importance in so many fields, from  chemistry to neurophysiol ogy. Dissipative structures intro­ duce probably one of the simplest physical mechanisms for  communication.  There is an interesting difference between the simplest kind  of mechanical oscillat or, the spring, and a chemical clock. The  chemical clock has a well-defined periodicity corresponding  to the limit cycle its trajectory is following. On the contrary, a  spring has a frequency that is amplitude-depend ent. From this  point of view a chemical clock is more reliable as a timekeeper  than a spring.  But chemical clocks are not the only type of self-organization.  Until now diffusion has been neglect ed. All substances were  assumed to be evenly distributed over the reaction space. This  is an idealization; small fluctuations will always lead to differ­ ences in concentrations and thus to diffusion. We therefore  have to add diffusion to the chemical reaction equations. The  diffusion-reaction equations of the Brusselator display an as­ tonishing range of behaviors available to this system. Indeed,  whereas at equilibrium and near-equ ilibrium the system re­ mains spatially homogeneous, the diffusion of the chemical  throughout the system induces, in the far-from-equilibrium re­ gion, the possibility of new types of instability , including the  amplification of fluctuations breaking the initial spatial sym­ metry. Oscillations in time, chemical clocks, thus cease to be  the only kind of dissipative structure available to the system.  Far from it; for example, oscillations may appear that are now  both time-and space-dependent. They correspond to chemical  waves of X and Y concentrations that periodically pass through  the system. </p><div id="pagenum"><p>181</p></div><p id="page">X hO  3  o  X h 1.10  o  X h2.04  3  21....----- o 149 THE THREE STAGES OF THERMODYNAMICS  hO.S8  o  h 1.88  I-- _�ror.- ____ 1 __ ____ �_ ...,  o  h 3.435  -----'"  1 0  Figure 6.

Again, the number of complexions corresponding to  such structures would be extremely small in comparison with  the number in a uniform distribution. Still, nonequilibrium  processes may lead to situations that would appear impossible  from the classical point of view.  The number of different dissipative structures compatible  with a given set of boundary conditions may be increased still  further when the problem is studied in two or three dimen­ sions instead of one. In a circular, two-dimensional space, for  instance, the spatially structured stationary state may be  characterized by the occurrence of a privileged axis.  X  --· --·  Figure 7.

If this simplification is abandoned, addi­ tional phenomena can occur. For example, the system takes  on a "natural size," which is a function of the parameters de­ scribing it. In this way the system determines its own intrinsic  size-that is, it determines the region that is spatially struc­ tured or crossed by periodic concentration waves.  These results still give a very incomplete picture of the vari­ ety of phenomena that may occur far from equilibrium. Let us  first mention the possibility of multiple states far from equi­ librium. For given boundary conditions there may appear  more than one stationary state-'-for instance one rich in the  chemical X, the other poor. The shift from one state to another  plays an important role in control mechanisms as they have  been described in biological systems.

What is new is their application to chemical systems.  It is worth noting that the first paper dealing with instabilities  in reaction-diffusion systems was published by Thring in 1952.  In recent years new types of attractors have been identified.  They appear only when the number of independent variables  increases (there are two independent variables in the Brussela­ tor, the variables X and Y). In particular, we can get "strange  attractors" that do not correspond to periodic behavior.  Figure 8, which summarizes some calculations by Hao Bai­ lin, gives an idea of such very complicated attractor lines cal­ culated for a model generalizing the Brusselator through the  addition of an external periodic supply of X. What is remark­ able is that most of the possibilities we have described have  been observed in inorganic chemistry as well as in a number of  biological situations.  In inorganic chemistry the best-known example is the  Belousov-Zhabotinsky reaction discovered in the early 1960s.  The corresponding reaction scheme, the Oregonator, intro­ duced by Noyes and his colleagues, is in essence similar to the  Brusselator though more complex. The Belousov-Zhabotinsky  reaction consists of the oxidation of an organic acid (malonic  acid) by a potassium bromate in the presence of a suitable cat­ alyst, cerium, manganese, or ferroin.

The Encounter with Molecular Biology  Earlier in this chapter we showed that in far-from-equ ilibrium  conditions various types of self-organ ization processes may  occur. They may lead to the appearance of chemical oscilla­ tions or to spatial structures . We have seen that the basic con­ dition for the appearance of such phenomena is the existence  of catalytic effects.  Although the effects of "nonlinear" reactions (the presence  of the reaction product) have a feedback action on their  "cause" and are comparatively rare in the inorganic world,  molecular biology has discovered that they are virtually the  rule as far as living systems are concerned. Autocata lysis (the  presence of X accelerates its own synthesis), autoinhibition  (the presence of X blocks a catalysis needed to synthesize it),  and crosscatalysis (two products belonging to two different re­ action chains activate each other's synthesis) provide the clas­ sical regulation mechanism guaranteeing the coherence of the  metabolic function.  Let us emphasize an interesting difference. In the examples  known in inorganic chemistry , the molecules involved are  simple but the reaction mechanisms are complex-in the  Belousov-Zhabotinsky reaction, about thirty compounds have  been identified. On the contrary , in the many biological exam­ ples we have, the reaction scheme is simple but the molecules  (proteins, nucleic acids, etc.) are highly complex and specific.  This can hardly be an accident. Here we encounter an initial  element marking the difference between physics and biology .  Biological systems have a past. Their constitutive molecules  are the result of an evolution; they have been selected to take  part in the autocatalytic mechanisms to generate very specific  forms of organization processes.  A description of the network of metabolic activations and </p><div id="pagenum"><p>186</p></div><p id="page">ORDER OUT OF CHAOS 154  inhibitions is an essential step in understanding the functional  logic of biological systems. This includes the triggering of syn­ theses the moment they are needed and the blocking of those  chemical reactions whose unused products would accumulate  in the cell.  The basic mechanism through which molecular biology ex­ plains the transmission and exploitation of genetic information  is itself a feedback loop, a "nonlinear" mechanism. Deoxyri­ bonucleic acid (DNA), which contains in sequential form all  the information required for the synthesis of the various basic  proteins needed in cell building and functioning, participates  in a sequence of reactions during which this information is trans­ lated into the form of different protein sequences. Among the  proteins synthesized, some enzymes exert a feedback action  that activates or controls not only the different transformation  stages but also the autocatalytic mechanism of DNA replica­ tion, by which genetic information is copied at the same rate  as the cells multiply .  Here we have a remarkable case of the convergence of two  sciences. The understanding attained here required comple­ mentary developments in physics and biology , one toward the  complex and the other toward the elementary.  Indeed, from the point of view of physics, we now investigate  "complex" situations far removed from the ideal situations  that can be described in terms of equilibrium thermodynam­ ics. On the other hand, molecular biology succeeded in relat­ ing living structures to a relatively small number of basic  biomolecules. Investigating the diversity of chemical mecha­ nisms, it discovered the intricacy of the metabolic reaction  chains, the subtle, complex logic of the control, inhibition, and  activation of the catalytic function of the enzymes associated  with the critical step of each of the metabolic chains. In this  way molecular biology provides the microscopic basis for the  instabilities that may occur in far-from-equilibrium conditions.  In a sense, living systems appear as a well-organized fac­ tory: on the one hand, they are the site of multiple chemical  transformations; on the other, they present a remarkable "space­ time" organization with highly nonuniform distribution of bio­ chemical material. We can now link function and structure.  Let us briefly consider two examples that have been studied  extensively in the past few years. </p><div id="pagenum"><p>187</p></div><p id="page">155 THE THREE STAGES OF THERMODYNAMICS  First we shall consider glycolysis, the chain of metabolic  reactions during which glucose is broken down and an energy­ rich substance ATP (adenosine triphosphate) is synthetized,  providing an essential source of energy common to all living  cells. For each glucose molecule that is broken down, two  molecules of ADP (adenosine disphosphate) are transformed  into two molecules of ATP. Glycolysis provides a fine example  of how complemetary the analytical approach of biology and  the investigation of stability in far-from-equilibrium conditions  are.6  Biochemical experiments have discovered the existence of  temporal oscillations in concentrations related to the glyco­ lytic cycle. 7 It has been shown that these oscillations are deter­ mined by a key step in the reaction sequen ce, a step activated  by ADP and inhibited by ATP. This is a typical nonlinear phe­ nomenon well suited to regulate metabolic functioning. In­ deed, each time the cell draws on its energy reserves, it is  exploiting the phosphate bonds, and ATP is converted into  ADP. ADP accumulation inside the cell thus signifies intensive  energy consumption and the need to replenish stocks. ATP  accumulat ion, on the other hand, means that glucose can be  broken down at a slower rate.  Theoretical investigation of this process has shown that this  mechanism is indeed liable to produce an oscillation phe­ nomenon, a chemical clock. The theoretically calculated val­ ues of the chemical concentrations necessary to produce  oscillation and the period of the cycle agree with the experi­ mental data. Glycolytic oscillation produces a modulation of  all the cell's energy processes which are dependent on ATP  concentration and therefore indirectly on numerous other met­ abolic chains.  We may go farther and show that in the glycolytic pathway  the reactions controlled by some of the key enzymes are in far­ from-equilibrium conditions. Such calculations have been re­ ported by Benno Hesss and have since been extended to other  systems. Under usual conditions the glycolytic cycle corre­ sponds to a chemical clock, but changing these conditions can  induce spatial pattern formations in complete agreement with  the predictions of existing theoretical models.  A living system appears very complex from the thermody­ namic point of view. Certain reactions are close to equi-</p><div id="pagenum"><p>188</p></div><p id="page">ORDER OUT OF CHAOS 156  librium, and others are not. Not everything in a living system  is "alive." The energy flow that crosses it somewhat resem­ bles the flow of a river that generally moves smoothly but that  from time to time tumbles down a waterfall; which liberates  part of the energy it contains.  Let us consider another biological process that also has  been studied from the point of view of stability: the aggrega­ tion of slime molds, the Acrasiales amoebas (Dictyostelium  discoideum). This process9A is an interesting case on the bor­ derline between unicellular and pluricellular biology . When  The aggregation of cellular slime molds furnishes a particularly re­ markable example of a self-organization phenomenon in a biological  sYltem in which a chemical clock plays an essential role.

This situation extends until food, principally furnished by bacte­ ria, becomes scarce. Then the amoebae cease to reproduce and enter into  an interphase that lasts some eight hours. At the end of this period the  amoebae begin to aggregate around cells that behave as aggre gation cen­ ters. The aggregation occurs in response to chemotactic signals emitted by  the centers_ The aggregate thus formed migrates until the conditions for the  formation of a fruiting body are satisfied. Then the mass of cells differentiates  to form a stalk surmounted by a mass of spores. </p><div id="pagenum"><p>189</p></div><p id="page">157 THE THREE STAGES OF THERMODYNAMICS  In Dictyostelium discoideum, the aggregation proceeds in a periodic man­ ner. Movies of aggregation process show the existence of concentric waves  of amoebae moving toward the center with a periodicity of several minutes.  The nature of the chemotactic factor is known: it is cyclic AMP (cAMP), a  substance involved in numerous biochemical processes such as hormonal  regulations. The aggregation centers release the signals of cAMP in a pe­ riodic fashion. The other cells respond by moving toward the centers and by  relaying the signals to the periphery of the aggregation territory . The exis­ tence of a mechanism of relay of the chemotactic signals allows each center  to control the aggregation of some 105 amoebae.  The analysis of a model of the process of aggregation reveals the exis­ tence of two types of bifurcations. First the aggregation itself represents a  breaking of spatial symmetry . The second bifurcation breaks the temporal  symmetry.  Initially the amoebae are homogeneously distributed. When some of them  begin to secrete the chemotactic signals, there appear local fluctuations in  the concentration of cAMP. For a critical value of some parameter of the  system (diffusion coefficient of cAMp, motility of the amoebae, etc.), fluctua­ tions are amplified: the homogeneous distribution becomes unstable and the  amoebae evolve toward an inhomogeneous. distribution in space. This new  distribution corresponds to the accumulation of amoebae around aggrega­ tion centers.  To understand the origin of the periodicity in the aggregation of D. dis­ coideum, it is necessary to study the mechanism of synthesis of the chem­ otactic signal. On the basis of experimental observations one can describe  this mechanism by the scheme of Figure B.  _----+�:.-- cAM P �  ATP cAMP  Y  Figure B  On the surface of the cell, receptors (R) bind the molecules of cAMP. The  receptor faces the extracellular medium and is functionally linked to an en­ zyme, adenylate cyclase (C), which transforms intracellular ATP into cAMP.  The cAMP thus synthesized is transported across the membrane into the  extracellular medium, where it is degraded by phosphodiesterase, an en­ zyme that is secreted by the amoebae. The experiments show that binding of  extracellular cAMP to the membrane receptor activates adenylate cyclase  (positive feedback indicated by +).  On the basis of this autocatalytic regulation, the analysiS of a model for </p><div id="pagenum"><p>190</p></div><p id="page">ORDER OUT OF CHAOS 158  cAMP synthesis has permitted unification of different types of behavior ob­ served during aggregation. se  Two key parameters of the model are the concentrations of adenylate  cyclase (s) and of phosphodieste rase (k). Figure C (redrawn from A. GoLD·  BETER and L. SEGEL, Differentiation, Vol. 17 [1980], pp. 127-35), shows the  behavior of the modelized system in the space formed by s and k.  Figure C cu  - 0  :>.  c  cu  "'Q  <  A  Phosphodiesterase , k  Three regions can be distinguished for different values of k and s. Region  A corresponds to a stable, nonexcitable stationary state; region B to a sta­ tionary state stable but excitable: the system is capable of amplifying small  perturbations in the concentration of cAMP in a pulsatory manner (and thus  of relaying cAMP signals); region C corresponds to a regime of sustained  oscillations around an unstable stationary state.  The arrow indicates a possible "developmental path" corresponding to a  rise in phospho diesterase (k) and adenylate cyclase (s), a rise that is ob­ served to occur after the beginning of starvation. The crossing of regions A,  B and C corresponds to the observed change of behavior: cells are at first  incapable of responding to extracellular cAMP signals; thereafter they relay  these signals and, finally, they become capable of synthetizing them pe­ riodically in an autonomous way. The aggregation centers would thus be the  cells for which the parameters s and k have reached the more rapidly a point  located inside region 0 after starvation has begun. </p><div id="pagenum"><p>191</p></div><p id="page">159 THE THREE STAGES OF THERMODYNAMICS  the environment in which these amoebas live and multiply be­ comes poor in nutrients, they undergo a spectacular transfor­ mation. (See Figure A.) Starting as a population of isolated  cells, they join to form a mass composed of several tens of  thousands of cells. This "pseudoplasmodium" then undergoes  differentiation, all the while changing shape. A "foot" forms,  consisting of about one third of the cells and containing abun­ dant cellulose. This foot supports a round mass of spores,  which will detach themselves and spread, multiplying as soon  as they come in contact with a suitable nutrient medium and  thus forming a new colony of amoebas. This is a spectacular  example of adaptation to the environment. The population  lives in one region until it has exhausted the available re­ sources. It then goes through a metamorphosis by means of  which it acquires the mobility to invade other environments.  An investigation of the first stage of the aggregation process  reveals that it begins with the onset of displacement waves in  the amoeba population, with a pulsating motion of con­ vergence of the amoebaes toward a "center of attraction,"  which appears to be produced spontaneously . Experimental  investigation and modelization have shown that this migration  is a response by the cells to the existence in the environment  of a concentration gradient in a key substance, cyclic AMP,  which is periodically produced by an amoeba which is the at­ tractor center and later by other cells through a relay mecha­ nism. Here we again see the remarkable role of chemical  clocks. They provide, as we have already stressed, new means  of communication. In the present case, the self-organization  mechanism leads to communication between cells.  There is another aspect we wish to emphasize. Slime mold  aggregation is a typical example of what may be termed "order  through fluctuations" : the setting up of the attractor center  giving off the AMP indicates that the metabolic regime corre­ sponding to a normal nutritive environment has become un­ stable-that is, the nutritive environment has become  exhausted. The fact that under such conditions of food short­ age any given amoeba can be the first to emit cyclic AMP and  thus become an attractor center corresponds to the random  behavior of fluctuatio ns. This fluctuation is then amplified and  organizes the medium. </p><div id="pagenum"><p>192</p></div><p id="page">ORDER OUT OF CHAOS 160  Bifurcations and Symmetry-Breaking  Let us take a closer look at the emergence of self-organization  and the processes that occur when we go beyond this thresh­ old. At equilibrium or near-equilibrium, there is only one  steady state that will depend on the values of some control  paramete rs. We shall call A the control paramet er, which, for  example, may be the concentration of substance B in the  Brusselator described in section 4. We now follow the change  in the state of the system as the value of B increases. In this  way the system is pushed farther and farther away from equi­ librium. At some point we reach the threshold of the stability  of the "thermodynamic branch ." Then we reach what is gener­ ally called a "bifurcation point." (These are the points whose  role Maxwell emphasized in his thoughts on the relation be­ tween determinism and free choice [see Chapter II, section  3].)

At bifur­ cation point B, the thermodynamic branch becomes unstable  in respect to fluctuations. For the value Ac of the control pa­ rameter A, the system may be in three different steady states:  C, E, D. 1\vo of these states are stable, one unstable. It is very  important to emphasize that the behavior of such systems de­ pends on their history. Suppose we slowly increase the value  of the control parameter A; we are likely to follow the path A,  B, C in Figure 10. On the contrary , if we start with a large  value of the concentration X and maintain the value of the con­ trol parameter constant, we are likely to come to point D. The  state we reach depends on the previous history of the system.  Until now history has been commonly used in the interpreta­ tion of biological and social phenomena, but that it may play  an important role in simple chemical processes is quite unex­ pected.  Consider the bifurcation diagram represented in Figure 11.  This differs from the previous diagram in that at the bifurca­ tion point two new stable solutions emerge. Thus a new ques­ tion: Where will the system go when we reach the bifurcation  point? We have here a "choice" between two possibilities;  X  Figure 11. Symmetrical bifurcation diagram. X is plotted as a function of A.  For A<Ac there is only one stationary state, which is stable.

Two possible spatial distributions of the chemical com­ ponent X, corresponding to each of the two branches in Figure 11. Figure 12  corresponds to a "left" structure as component X has a higher concentration  in the left part; similarly, Figure 13 corresponds to a "right" structure.  The two structures are mirror images of one another. In Figure  12 the concentration of X is larger at the left; in Figure 13 it is  larger at the right. How will the system choose between left  and right? There is an irreducible random element; the mac­ roscopic equation cannot predict the path the system will  take. Turning to a microscopic description will not help. There  is also no distinction between left and right. We are faced with  chance events very similar to the fall of dice. </p><div id="pagenum"><p>195</p></div><p id="page">163 THE THREE STAGES OF THERMODYNAMICS  We would expect that if we repeat the experiment many  times and lead the system beyond the bifurcation point, half of  the system will go into the left configuration, half into the  right. Here another interesting question arises: In the world  around us, some basic simple symmetries seem to be bro­ ken.to Everybody has observed that shells often have a prefer­ ential chirality . Pasteur went so far as to see in dissymmetry, in  the breaking of symmetry , the very characteristic of life. We  know today that DNA, the most basic nucleic acid, takes the  form of a left-handed helix. How did this dissymmetry arise?  One common answer is that it comes from a unique event that  has by chance favored one of the two possible outcomes; then  an autocatalytic process sets in, and the left-handed structure  produces other left-handed structures. Others imagine a  "war" between left-and right-handed structures in which one  of them has annihilated the other. These are problems for  which we have not yet found a satisfactory answer. To speak of  unique events is not satisfactor y; we need a more "system­ atic" explanation.  We have recently discovered a striking example of the fun­ damental new properties that matter acquires in far-from­ equilibrium conditions: external fields, such as the gravitational  field, can be "perceived" by the system, creating the possibil­ ity of pattern selection.  How would an external field-a gravitational field-change  an equilib rium situation? The answer is provided by Boltz­ mann's order principle: the basic quantity involved is the ratio  of potential energy/th ermal energy. This is a small quantity for  the gravitational field of earth; we would have to climb a moun­ tain to achieve an appreciable change in pressure or in the  composition of the atmosphere. But recall the Benard cell;  from a mechanical perspective, its instability is the raising of  its center of gravity as the result of thermal dilatation. In other  words, gravitation plays an essential role here and leads to a  new structure in spite of the fact that the Benard cell may have  a thickness of only a few millimeters. The effect of gravitation  on such a thin layer would be negligible at equilibrium, but  because of the nonequilibrium induced by the difference in  temperature, macroscopic effects due to gravitation become  visible even in this thin layer. Nonequilibrium magnifies the  effect of gravitation.tl </p><div id="pagenum"><p>196</p></div><p id="page">ORDER OUT OF CHAOS 164  Gravitation obviously will modify the diffusion flow in a re­ action diffusion equation. Detailed calculations show that this  can be quite dramatic near a bifurcation point of an unper­ turbed system. In particula r, we can conclude that very small  gravitational fields can lead to pattern selection.  Let us again consider a system with a bifurcation diagram  such as represented in Figure 11. Suppose that for no gravita­ tion, g=O, we have, as in Figures 12 and 13, an asymmetric  "up/down" pattern as well as its mirror image, "down/up. "  Both are equally probable, but when g is taken into account,  the bifurcation equations are modified because the diffusion  flow contains a term proporti onal to g. As a result, we now  obtain the bifurcation diagram represented in Figure 14. The  original bifurcation has disappeared-this is true whatever the  value of the field. One structure (a) now emerges continuously  as the bifurcation parameter grows, while the other (b) can be  attained only through a finite perturbation.  x  . ...... .  . ...  �. .--- --- ",  .•...... �  '.  ••••• ••• b)  .........

The symmetrical bifurca­ tion that would occur in the absence of the field is indicated by the dotted  line. The bifurcation value is "0; the stable branch (b) is at finite di'stance from  branch (a). </p><div id="pagenum"><p>197</p></div><p id="page">165 THE THREE STAGES OF THERMODYN AMICS  Therefore, if we follow the path (a), we expect the system to  follow the continuous path. This expectation is correct as long  as the distance s between the two branches remains large in re­ spect to thermal fluctuations in the concentration of X. There  occurs what we would like to call an "assisted" bifurcation.  As before, at about the value Ac a self-organization process  may occur. But now one of the two possible patterns is pre­ ferred and will be selected.  The important point is that, depending on the chemical pro­ cess responsible for the bifurcation, this mechanism expresses  an extraordinary sensitivity. Matter, as we mentioned earlier  in this chapter , perceives differences that would be insignifi­ cant at equilibrium. Such possibilities lead us to think of the  simplest organisms, such as bacteria, which we know are able  to react to electric or magnetic fields. More generally they  show that far-from-equilibrium chemistry leads to possible  "adaptation" of chemical processes to outside conditions. This  contrasts strongly with equilibrium situations, in which large  perturbations or modifications of the boundary conditions are  necessary to determine a shift for one structure to another .  The sensitivity of far-from-equilibrium states to external fluc­ tuations is another example of a system's spontaneous "adapta­ tive organization" to its environment. Let us give an example 12  of self-organization as a function of fluctuating external condi­ tions. The simplest conceivable chemical reaction is the isom­ erization reaction where A�B. In our model the product A can  also enter into another reaction: A+ light-+ A *-+A+ heat. A  absorbs light and gives it back as heat while leaving its excited  state A*. Consider these two processes as taking place in a  closed system: only light and heat can be exchanged with the  outside. Nonlinearity exists in the system because the transfor­ mation from B to A absorbs heat: the higher the temperature,  the faster the formation of A. But also the higher the concentra­ tion of A, the higher the absorption of light by A and its trans­ formation into heat, and the higher the temperature. A  catalyzes its own formation.  We expect to find that the concentration of A corresponding  to the stationary state increases with the light intensity. This is  indeed the case. But starting from a critical point, there ap­ pears one of the standard far-from-equilibrium phenomena:  the coexistence of multiple stationary states. For the same val-</p><div id="pagenum"><p>198</p></div><p id="page">ORDER OUT OF CHAOS 166  ues of light intensity and temperature, the system can be  found in two different stable stationary states with different  concentrations of A. A third, unstable state marks the thresh­ old between the first two. Such a coexistence of stationary  states gives birth to the well-known phenomenon of hystere­ sis. But this is not the whole story. If the light intensity , in­ stead of being constant, is taken as randomly fluctuating, the  situation is altered profoundly . The zone of coexistence be­ tween the two stationary states increases, and for certain val­ ues of the parameters coexistence among three stationary  stable states becomes possible.  In such a case, a random fluctuation in the external flux,  often termed "noise," far from being a nuisance, produces  new types of behavior, which would imply, under deterministic  fluxes, much more complex reaction schemes. It is important  to remember that random noise in the fluxes may be consid- X  •  '  •  p I  1\ .. � I ' ' I J ' 'I v � Q •  p':  b1 b2 b  Figure 15. This figure shows how a "hysteresis" phenomenon occurs if we  have the value of the bifurcation parameter b first growing and then diminish­ ing. If the system is initially in a stationary state belonging to the lower  branch, it will stay there while b grows. But at b = b2, there will be a discon­ tinuity: The system jumps from Q to Q', on the higher branch. Inversely,  starting from a state on the higher branch, the system will remain there till  b=b1, when it will jump down toP'. Such types of bistable behavior are  observed in many fields, such as lasers, chemical reactions or biological  membranes. </p><div id="pagenum"><p>199</p></div><p id="page">167 THE THREE STAGES OF THERMODYNAMICS  ered as unavoidable in any "natural system." For example, in  biological or ecological systems the parameters defining inter­ action with the environment cannot generally be considered as  constants. Both the cell and the ecological niche draw their  sustenance from their environme nt; and humidity , pH, salt  concentration, light, and nutrients form a permanently fluc­ tuating environment. The sensitivity of nonequilibrium states,  not only to fluctuations produced by their internal activity but  also to those coming from their environment, suggests new  perspectives for biological inquiry.  Cascading Bifurcations  and the Transitions to Chaos  The preceding paragraph dealt only with the first bifurcation  or, as mathematicians put it, the primary bifurcation, which  occurs when we push a system beyond the threshold of sta­ bility. Far from exhausting the new solutions that may appear,  this primary bifurcation introduces only a single characteristic  time (the period of the limit cycle) or a single characteristic  length. To generate the complex spatial temporal activity ob­ served in chemical or biological systems, we have to follow the  bifurcation diagram farther.  We have already alluded to phenomena arising from the  complex interplay of a multitude of frequences in hydrody­ namical or chemical systems. Let us consider Benard struc­ tures, which appear at a critical distance from equilibrium.  Farther away from thermal equilibrium the convection flow  begins to oscillate in time; as the distance from equilibrium is  increased still farther, more and more oscillation frequencies  appear, and eventually the transition to equilibrium is com­ plete.13 The interplays among the frequencies produce pos­ sibilities of large fluctuations; the "region" in the bifurcation  diagram defined by such values of the parameters is often  called "chaotic." In cases such as the Benard instabili ty, order  or coherence is sandwiched between thermal chaos and non­ equilibrium turbulent chaos. Indeed, if we continue to in­ �rease the gradient of temperature, the �onvcction patterns  become more complex ; oscillations set in, and the ordered as-</p><div id="pagenum"><p>200</p></div><p id="page">2:  o  0:  u..  &£J U  Z  �  !:!!  c ORDER OUT OF CHAOS ' 168  TRACES OF Br-CONCENTRATION  Homogeneous Steady State  f\/l.J\NVVVV\ Sinusoidal Oscillations  •  •  •  TIME Complex Periodic States  (Subharmonic bifurcation)  Chaos  Mixed -Mode Oscillations  Chaotic  and  Periodic  Relaxation Oscillations  Figure 16.

THREE STAGES OF THERMODYNAMICS  In many cases it is difficult to disentangle the meaning of  words such as "order" and "chaos ." Is a tropical forest an  ordered or a chaotic system? The history of any particular  animal species will appear very contingent, dependent on  other species and on environmental accidents. Nevertheless,  the feeling persists that, as such, the overall pattern of a tropi­ cal forest; as represented, for instance, by the diversity of spe­ cies, corresponds to the very archetype of order. Whatever the  precise meaning we will eventually give to this termino logy, it  is clear that in some cases the succession of bifurcations forms  an irreversible evolution where the determinism of charac­ teristic frequencies produces an increasing randomness stem­ ming from the multiplicity of those frequenc ies.  A remarkably simple road to "chaos" that has already at­ tracted a lot of attention is the "Feigenbaum sequence ." It  concerns any system whose behavior is characterized by a  very general feature-that is, for a determined range of param­ eter values the system's behavior is periodic, with a period T;  beyond this range, the period becomes 2T, and beyond yet an­ other critical threshold, the system needs 4 Tin order to repeat  itself. The system is thus characterized by a succession of bi­ furcations, with successive period doubling. This constitutes a  typical route going from simple periodic behavior to the com­ plex aperiodic behavior occurring when the period has dou­ bled ad infinitum. This route, as Feigenbaum discovered, is  characterized by universal numerical features independent of  the mechanism involved as long as the system possesses the  qualitative property of period doubling. "In fact, most mea­ surable properties of any such system in this aperiodic limit  now can be determined in a way that essentially bypasses the  details of the equations governing each specific system .... "14  In other cases, such as those represented in Figure 16, both  deterministic and stochastic elements characterize the history  of the system.  If we consider Figure 17 and a value of the control param­ eter of the order of X6, we see that the system already has a  wealth of possible stable and unstable behaviors. The "histori­ cal" path along which the system evolves as the control parame­ ter grows is characterized by a succession of stable regions,  where deterministic laws dominate, and of instable ones, near  the bifurcation points, where the system can "choose" be-</p><div id="pagenum"><p>202</p></div><p id="page">ORDER OUT OF CHAOS 170  tween or among more than one possible future. Both the deter­ ministic character of the kinetic equations whereby the set of  possible states and their respective stability can be calculated,  and the random fluctuations "choosing" between or among  the states around bifurcation points are inextricably con­ nected.

The system behaves as a whole, as if it were  the site of long-range forces. In spite of the fact that interac­ tions among molecules do not exceed a range of some I0-8  em, the system is structured as though each molecule were  "informed" about the overall state of the system.  It has often been said-and we have already repeated it­ that modern science was born when Aristotelian space, for  which one source of inspiration was the organization and soli­ darity of biological functions, was replaced by the homoge­ neous and isotropic space of Euclid. However, the theory of  dissipative structures moves us closer to Aristotle's concep­ tion. Whether we are dealing with a chemical clock, concen­ tration waves, or the inhomogeneous distribution of chemical  products , instability has the effect of breaking symmetry , both  temporal and spatial. In a limit cycle, no two instants are  equivalent ; the chemical reaction acquires a phase similar to  that characterizing a light wave, for example. Again, when a  favored direction results from an instability, space ceases to be  isotropic. We move from Euclidian to Aristotelian space!  It is tempting to speculate that the breaking of space and  time symmetry plays an important part in the fascinating phe­ nomena of morphogenesis. These phenomena have often led  to the conviction that some internal purpose must be involved,  a plan realized by the embryo when its growth is complete. At  the beginning of this century , German embryologist Hans  Driesch believed that some immaterial "entelechy" was re­ sponsible for the embryo's development. He had discovered  that the embryo at an early stage was capable of withstanding  the severest perturbations and, in spite of them, of developing  into a normal, functional organism. On the other hand, when  we observe embryological development on film, we "see"  jumps corresponding to radical reorganizations followed by  periods of more "pacific" quantitative growth. There are, for­ tunately , few mistakes. The jumps are performed in a re­ producible fashion. We might speculate that the basic  mechanism of evolution is based on the play between bifurca-</p><div id="pagenum"><p>204</p></div><p id="page">ORDER OUT OF CHAOS 172  tions as mechanisms of exploration and the selection of chemi­ cal interactions stabilizing a particular trajectory. Some forty  years ago, the biologist Waddington introduced such an idea.  The concept of "chreod" that he introduced to describe the  stabilized paths of development would correspond to possible  lines of development produced as a result of the double imper­ ative of flexibility and security. 15 Obviously the problem is  very complex and can be dealt with only briefly here.  Many years ago embryologists introduced the concept of a  morphogenetic field and put forward the hypothesis that the  differentiation of a cell depends on its position in that field.  But how does a cell "recognize" its position? One idea that is  often debated is that of a "gradient" of a characteristic sub­ stance, of one or more "morphogens." Such gradients could  actually be produced by symmetry- breaking instabilities in  far-from-equilibrium conditions. Once it has been produced, a  chemical gradient can provide each cell with a different chemi­ cal environment and thus induce each of them to synthesize a  specific set of protein s. This model, which is now widely used,  seems to be in agreement with experimental evidence. In par­ ticular, we may refer to Kauffman's work16 on drosophila. A  reaction-diffusion system is taken as responsible for the com­ mitment to alternative development programs that appear to  occur in different groups of cells in the early embryo.

The model leads to suc­ cessful predictions about the result of transplantations as a  function of the "distance" between the original and final re­ gions-that is, of the number of differences among the states  of the binary choices or "switches " that specify each of them.  Such ideas and models are especially important in biolog­ ical systems where the embryo begins to develop in an appar­ ently symmetrical state (for example , Fucus, Acetabularia).  We may ask if the embryo is really homogeneous at the begin­ ning. And even if small inhomogeneities are present in the ini­ tial environment, do they cause or channel evolution toward a  given structure? Precise answers to such questions are not  available at present. However, one thing seems established:  the instability connected with chemical reactions and trans­ port appears as the only general mechanism capable of break­ ing the symmetry of an initially homogeneous situation.  The very possibility of such a solution takes us far beyond  the age-old conflict between reductionists and antireduc­ tionists. Ever since Aristotle (and we have cited Stahl, Hegel,  Bergson, and other antireductionists), the same conviction  has been expressed: a concept of complex organization is re­ quired to connect the various levels of description and account  for the relationship between the whole and the behavior of the  parts. In answer to the reductio nists, for whom the sole  "cause" or organization can lie only in the part, Aristotle with  his formal cause, Hegel with his emergence of Spirit in Na­ ture, and Bergson with his simple, irrepress ible, organization­ creating act, assert that the whole is predominant. To cite  Bergson ,  In general, when the same object appears in one aspect  as simple and in another as infinitely complex, the two  aspects have by no means the same importance, or rather  the same degree of reality. In such cases, the simplicity  belongs to the object itself, and the infinite complexity to  the views we take in turning around it, to the symbols by  which our senses or intellect represent it to us, or, more  gc::nc::rally, to c::lc::mc::nts of a different order, with which we:  try to imitate it artificia lly, but with which it remains in-</p><div id="pagenum"><p>206</p></div><p id="page">ORDER OUT OF CHAOS 174  commensu rable, being of a different nature. An artist of  genius has painted a figure on his canvas. We can imitate  his picture with many-coloured squares of mosaic. And  we shall reproduce the curves and shades of the model so  much the better as our squares are smaller , more numer­ ous and more varied in tone. But an infinity of elements  infinitely small, presenting an infinity of shades, would  be necessary to obtain the exact equivalent of the figure  that the artist has conceived as a simple thing, which he  has wished to transpor t as a whole to the canvas, and  which is the more complete the more it strikes us as the  projection of an indivisible intuition. 17  In biology, the conflict between reductionists and antireduc­ tionists has often appeared as a conflict between the assertion  of an external and an internal purpose. The idea of an imma­ nent organizing intelligence is thus often opposed by an orga­ nizational model borrowed from the technology of the time  (mechanical , heat, cybernetic machines), which immediately  elicits the retort: "Who" built the machine, the automaton  that obeys external purpose?  As Bergson emphasized at the beginning of this century ,  both the technological model and the vitalist idea of an inter­ nal organizing power are expressions of an inability to con­ ceive evolutive organization without immediately referring it  to some preexisting goal. Today, in spite of the spectacular suc­ cess of molecular biology, the conceptual situation remains  about the same: Bergson' s argument could be applied to con­ temporary metaphors such as "organiz er," "regulator," and  "genetic program." Unorthodox biologists such as Paul Weiss  and Conrad Waddington 18 have rightly criticized the way this  kind of qualification attributes to individual molecules the  power to produce the global order biology aims to understand,  and, by so doing, mistakes the formulation of the problem for  its solution.  It must be recognized that technological analogies in biol­ ogy are not without interest. However, the general validity of  such analogies would imply that, as in an electronic circuit, for  example, there is a basic homogeneity between the description  of molecular interaction and that of global behavior: The func­ tioning of a circuit may be deduced from the nature and posi-</p><div id="pagenum"><p>207</p></div><p id="page">175 THE THREE STAGES OF THERMODYNAMICS  tion of its relays; both refer to the same scale, since the relays  were designed and installed by the same engineer who built  the whole machine. This cannot be the rule in biology.  It is true that when we come to a biological system such as  the bacterial chemotaxis, it is hard not to speak of a molecular  machine consisting of receptors, sensory and regulatory pro­ cessing systems, and motor response . We know of approx­ imately twenty or thirty receptors that can detect highly  specific classes of compounds and make a bacterium swim up  spatial gradients of attractants or down gradients of repellents.  This "behavior" is determined by the output of the processing  system-that is, the switching on or off of a tumble that gener­ ates a change in the bacterium' s direction.l9  But such cases, fascinating as they are, do not tell the whole  story. In fact it is tempting to see them as limiting cases, as the  end products of a specific kind of selective evolution, empha­ sizing stability and reproducible behavior against openness  and adaptability . In such a perspective, the relevance of the  technological metaphor is not a matter of principle but of op­ portuni ty.  The problem of biological order involves the transition from  the molecular activity to the supermolecular order of the cell.  This problem is far from being solved.  Often biological order is simply presented as an improbable  physical state created and maintained by enzymes resembling  Maxwell's demon, enzymes that maintain chemical differ­ ences in the system in the same way as the demon maintains  temperature and pressure differences. If we accept this, biol­ ogy would be in the position described by Stahl. The laws of  nature allow only death. Stahl's notion of the organizing action  of the soul is replaced by the genetic information contained in  the nucleic acids and expressed in the formation of enzymes  that permit life to be perpetuated. Enzymes postpone death  and the disappearance of life.  In the context of the physics of irreversible processes, the  results of biology obviously have a different meaning and dif­ ferent implications. We know today that both the biosphere as  a whole as well as its components, living or dead, exist in far­ from-equilibrium conditions. In this context life, far from  being outside the natural order, appears as the supreme ex­ pression of the self-organizing processes that occur. </p><div id="pagenum"><p>208</p></div><p id="page">ORDER OUT OF CHAOS 176  We are tempted to go so far as to say that once the condi·  tions for self-organization are satisfied, life becomes as predic­ table as the Benard instability or a falling stone. It is a  . remarkable fact that recently discovered fossil forms of life  appear nearly simultaneously with the first rock formations  (the oldest microfossils known today date back 3.8.109 years,  while the age of the earth is supposed to be 4.6,109 years; the  formation of the first rocks is also dated back to 3.8.109 years).  The early appearance of life is certainly an argument in favor of  the idea that life is the result of spontaneous seif-organization  that occurs whenever conditions for it permit. However, we  must admit that we remain far from any quantita tive theory.  To return to our understanding of life and evolution, we are  now in a better position to avoid the risks implied by any de·  nunciation of reductionism. A system far from equilibrium may  be described as organized not because it realizes a plan alien  to elementar y activities, or transcending them, but, on the  contrary , because the amplification of a microscopic fluctuation  occurring at the "right moment" resulted in favoring one reaction  path over a number of other equally possible paths. Under cer·  tain circumstances, therefore, the role played by individual be­ havior can be decisive. More generally , the "overall" behavior  cannot in general be taken as dominating in any way the ele­ mentary processes constituting it. Self-organization processes  in far-from-equilibrium conditions correspond to a delicate in­ terplay between chance and necessity , between fluctuations  and deterministic laws. We expect that near a bifurcation, fluc­ tuations or random elements would play an important role,  while between bifurcations the deterministic aspects would  become dominant. These are the questions we now need to  investigate in more detail. </p><div id="pagenum"><p>209</p></div><p id="page">CHAPTER VI  ORDER THROUGH  FWCTUATIONS  Fluctuations and Chemistry  In our Introduction we noted that a reconceptualization of the  physical sciences is occurring today. They are moving from  deterministic, reversible processes to stochastic and irrevers­ ible ones. This change of perspective affects chemistry in a  striking way. As we have seen in Chapter V, chemical pro­ cesses, in contrast to the trajectories of classical dynamics,  correspond to irreversible processes. Chemical reactions lead  to entropy production. On the other hand, classical chemistry  continues to rely on a deterministic description of chemical  evolution. As we have seen in Chapter V, it is necessary to  produce differential equations involving the concentration of  the various chemical components. Once we know these con­ centrations at some initial time (as well as at appropriate  boundary conditions when space-dependent phenomena such as  diffusion are involved), we may calculate what the concenK-ation  will be at a later time. It is interesting to note that the deter­ ministic view of chemistry fails when far-from-equilibrium  processes are involved.  We have repeatedly emphasized the role of fluctuations. Let  us summarize here some of the more striking features. When­ ever we reach a bifurcation point, deterministic description  breaks down. The type of fluctuation present in the system  will lead to the choice of the branch it will follow. Crossing a  bifurcation is a stochastic process, such as the tossing of a  coin. Chemical chaos provides another example (see Chapter  V). Here we can no longer follow an individual chemical tra­ jectory. We cannot predict the details of temporal evolution.  177 </p><div id="pagenum"><p>210</p></div><p id="page">ORDER OUT OF CHAOS 178  Once again, only a statistical description is possible. The exis­ tence of an instability may be viewed as the result of a fluctua­ tion that is first localized in a small part of the system and then  spreads and leads to a new macroscopic state.  This situation alters the traditional view of the relation be­ tween the microscopic level as described by molecules or  atoms and the macroscopic level described in terms of global  variables such as concentration. In many situations fluctua­ tions correspond only to small corrections. As an example, let  us take a gas composed of N molecules enclosed in a vessel of  volume V. Let us divide this volume into two equal parts.  What is the number of particles X in one of these two parts?  Here the variable X is a "random" variable, and we would  expect it to have a value in the neighborhood of N/2.  A basic theorem in probability theory, the law of large num­ bers, provides an estimate of the "error" due to fluctuations.  In essence, it states that if we measure X we have to expect a  value of the order N/2±v'Nii. If N is large, the difference  introduced by fluctuations v'Nfi may also be large (if  N= 1Q24, VN= 1012); however, the relative error introduced  by fluctuations is of the order of (v'N!i)/(N /2) or llYN and  thus tends toward zero for a sufficiently large value of N. As  soon as the system becomes large enough, the law of large  numbers enables us to make a clear distinction between mean  values and fluctuations, and the latter may be neglected.  Hewever, in nonequilibrium processes we may find just the  opposite situation. Fluctuations determine the global out­ come. We could say that instead of being corrections in the  average values, fluctuations now modify those averages. This  is a new situation. For this reason we would like to introduce a  neologism and call situations resulting from fluctuation "order  through fluctuation." Before giving examples, let us make  some general remarks to illustl·ate the conceptual novelty of  this situation.  Readers may be familiar with the Heisenberg uncertainty  relations, which express in a striking way the probabilistic as­ pects of quantum theory. Since we can no longer simultane­ ously measure position and coordinates in quantum theory,  classical determinism is breaking down. This was believed to  be of no importance for the description of macroscopic objects  --- -------------</p><div id="pagenum"><p>211</p></div><p id="page">179 ORDER THROUGH FLUCTUA TIONS  such as living systems. But the role of fluctuations in nonequi­ librium systems shows that this is not the case. Randomness  remains essential on the macroscopic level as well. It is inter­ esting to note another analogy with quantum theory, which  assigns a wave behavior to all elementa ry particles. As we  have seen, chemical systems far from equilibrium may also  lead to coherent wave behavior: these are the chemical clocks  discussed in Chapter V. Once again, some of the properties  quantum mechanics discovered on the microscopic level now  appear on the macroscopic level.  Chemistry is actively involved in the reconceptualization of  science. I We are probably only at the beginning of new direc­ tions of research. It may well be, as some recent calculations  suggest, that the idea of reaction rate has to be replaced in  some cases by a statistical theory involving a distribution of  reaction probabiliti es.2  Fluctuations and Correlations  Let us go back to the types of chemical reaction discussed in  Chapter V. To take a specific example, consider a chain of  reactions such as APXPF. The kinetic equations in Chapter V  refer to the average concentrations. To emphasize this we shall  now write <X> instead of X. We can then ask what is the  probability at a given time of finding a number X for the con­ centration of this component. Obviously this probability will  fluctuate, as do the number of collisions among the various  molecules involved. It is easy to write an equation that de­ scribes the change in this probability distribution P(X,t) as a  result of processes that produce molecule X and of processes  that destroy that molecule. We may perform the calculation for  equilibrium systems or for steady-state systems. Let us first  mention the results obtained for equilibrium systems.  At equilibrium we virtually recover a classical probabilistic  distribution, the Poisson distribution, which is described in  every textbook on probabilities, since it is valid in a variety of  situations, such as the distribution of telephone calls, waiting  times in restaurants, or the fluctuation of the concentration of </p><div id="pagenum"><p>212</p></div><p id="page">ORDER OUT OF CHAOS 180  particles in a gas or a liquid. The mathematical form of this  distribution is of no importance here. We merely want to em­ phasize two of its aspects. First, it leads to the law of large  numbers as formulated in the first section of this chapter . Thus  fluctuations indeed become negligible in a large system. More­ over, this law enables us to calculate the correlation between  the number of particles X at two different points in space sepa­ rated by some distance r. The calculation demonstrates that at  equilibrium there is no such correlation. The probability of  finding two molecules X and X' at two different points rand r'  is the product of finding X at rand X' at r' (we cons.ider dis­ tances that are large in respect to the range of intermolecular  forces).  One of the most unexpected results of recent research is that  this situation changes drastically when we move to nonequilib­ rium situations. First, when we come close to bifurcation  points the fluctuations become abnormally high and the law of  large numbers is violated. This is to be expected, since the  system may then "choose" among various regimes. Fluctua­ tions can even reach the same order of magnitude as the mean  macroscopic values. Then the distinction between fluctuations  and mean values breaks down. Moreover , in the case of a non­ linear type of chemical reaction discussed in Chapter V, long­ range correlations appear. Particles separated by macroscopic  distances become linked. Local events have repercussions  throughout the whole system. It is interesting to note3 that  such long-range correlations appear at the precise point of  transition from equilibrium to nonequilibrium. From this point  of view the transition resembles a phase transition. However ,  the amplitudes of these long-range correlations are at first  small but increase with distance from equilibrium and may be­ come infinite at the bifurcation points.  We believe that this type of behavior is quite interesting,  since it gives a molecular basis to the problem of communica­ tion mentioned in our discussion of the chemical clock. Even  before the macroscopic bifurcation, the system is organized  through these long-range correlations. We come back to one of  the main ideas of this book: nonequilibrium as a source of or­ der. Here the situation is especially clear. At equilibrium mole­ cules behave as essentially independent entities; they· ignore  one another. We would like to call them "hypnons," "sleep-</p><div id="pagenum"><p>213</p></div><p id="page">181 ORDER THROUGH FLUCTUATIONS  walkers." Though each of them may be as complex as we like,  they ignore one another. However , nonequilibrium wakes them  up and introduces a coherence quite foreign to equilibr ium.  The microscopic theory of irreversible processes that we shall  develop in Chapter IX will present a similar picture of matter.  Matter's activity is related to the nonequilibrium conditions  that it itself may generate. Just as in macroscopic behavior , the  laws of fluctuations and correlations are universal at equi­ librium (when we find the Poisson type of distribution); they  become highly specific depending on the type of nonlinearity  involved when we cross the boundary between equilibrium  and nonequilibrium.  The Amplification of Fluctuations  Let us first take two examples wherein the growth of a fluctua­ tion preceding the formation of a new structure can be fol­ lowed in detail. The first is the aggregation of slime molds,  which when threatened with starvation coalesce into a single  supracellular mass. We have already mentioned this in Chap­ ter V. Another illustration of the role of fluctuations is the first  stage in the construction of a termites' nest. This was first  described by Grasse, and Deneubourg has studied it from the  standpoint that interests us here."'  Self-Aggregation Process in an Insect Population  Larvae of a coleoptera (Dendroctonus micans [Scot.]). are initially dis­ tributed at random between two horizontal sheets of glass, 2 mm apart. The  borders are open and the surface is equal to 400 cm2.  The aggregation process appears to result from the competition between  two factors: the random moves of the larvae, and their reaction to a chemical  product, a "pheromon" they synthetize from terpanes contained in the tree  on which they feed and that each of them emits at a rate depending on its  nutrition state. The pheromon diffuses in space, and the larvae move in the  direction of its concentration gradient. Such a reaction provides an auto­ catalytic mechanism since, as they gather in a cluster, the larvae contribute  to enhance the attractiveness of the correspond ing region. The higher the  local density of larvae in this region, the stronger the gradient and the more  intense the tendency to move toward the crowded point.  The experiment shows that the density of the larvae population deter­ mines not only the rate of the aggregation process but its effectiveness as  well-that is, the number of larvae that will finally be part of the cluster. At </p><div id="pagenum"><p>214</p></div><p id="page">ORDER OUT OF CHAOS 182  high density (Figure A) a cluster appears and rapidly grows at the center of  the experime ntal setup. At very low density (Figure B), no stable cluster ap­ pears.  Moreover, other experiments have explored the possibility for a cluster to  develop star ting from a "nucleus" artificially created in a peripheral region of  the system. Different solutions appear depending on the number of larvae in  this initial nucleus.  J  ,.  I'  (  t  \  ' I  Figure A. Self-aggregation at high density.

Growth of a cluster (I) introduced peripheral ly, which induce the  formation of a second little cluster (II).  The construction of a termites' nest is one of those coherent  activities that have led some scientists to speculate about a  .. collective mind" in insect communities. But curiously, it ap­ pears that in fact the termites need very little information to  participate in the construction of such a huge and complex  edifice as the nest. The first stage in this activity, the con­ struction of the base, has been shown by Grasse to be the  result of what appears to be disordered behavior among ter­ mites. At this stage, they transport and drop lumps of earth in  a random fashion , but in doing so they impregnate the lumps  with a hormone that attracts other termites. The situation  could thus be represented as follows : the initial "fluctuation"  would be the slightly larger concentration of lumps of earth,  which inevitably occurs at one time or another at some point  in the area. The amplification of this event is produced by the </p><div id="pagenum"><p>219</p></div><p id="page">187 ORDER THROUGH FLUCTUA TIONS  increased density of termites in the region, attracted by the  · slightly higher hormone concentration. As termites become  more numerous in a region, the probability of their dropping  lumps of earth there increases, leading in turn to a still higher  concentration of the hormone. In this way "pillars" are  formed, separated by a distance related to the range over  which the hormone spreads. Similar examples have recently  been describe d.  Although Boltzmann' s order principle enables us to de­ scribe chemical or biological processes in which differences  are leveled out and initial conditions forgotten, it cannot ex­ plain situations such as these, where a few "decisions" in an  unstable situation may channel a system formed by a large  number of interactive entities toward a global structure.  When a new structure results from a finite perturbation, the  fluctuation that leads from one regime to the other cannot pos­ sibly overrun the initial state in a single move. It must first estab­ lish itself in a limited region and then invade the whole space:  there is a nucleation mechanism. Depending on whether the  size of the initial fluctuating region lies below or above some  critical value (in the case of chemical dissipative structures,  this threshold depends in particular on the kinetic constants  and diffusion coefficients), the fluctuation either regresses or  else spreads to the whole system. We are familiar with nuclea­ tion phenomena in the classical theory of phase change: in a  gas, for example , condensation droplets incessantly form and  evapora te. That temperature and pressure reach a point where  the liquid state becomes stable means that a critical droplet  size can be defined (which is smaller the lower the temperature  and the higher the pressure). If the size of a droplet exceeds  this "nuclea tion thresho ld," the gas almost instantaneously  transforms into a liquid.  Moreover , theoretical studies and numerical simulations  show that the critical nucleus size increases with the efficacy  of the diffusion mechanisms that link all the regions of sys­ tems. In other words, the faster communication takes place  within a system , the greater the percentage of unsuccessf ul  fluctuations and thus the more stable the system . This aspect  of the critical-size problem means that in such situations the  "outside world,·· the environment of the fluctua ting region,  always tends to damp fluctuations. These will be destroyed or </p><div id="pagenum"><p>220</p></div><p id="page">(a) ORDER OUT OF CHAOS 188  (b)  Figure 19. Nucleation of a liquid droplet in a supersaturated vapor.

The existence of the threshold has been experimentally verified for dissipa­ tive structures.  amplified according to the effectiveness of the communication  between the fluctuating region and the outside world. The crit­ ical size is thus determined by the competition between the  system' s "integrative power" and the chemical mechanisms  amplifying the fluctuation.  This model applies to the results obtained recently in in  vitro experimental studies of the onset of cancer tumors.s An  individual tumor cell is seen as a "fluctuati on," uncontrollably  and permanently able to appear and to develop through rep­ lication. It is then confronted with the population of cytotoxic  cells that either succeeds in destroying it or fails. Following  the values of the different parameters characteristic of the rep­ lication and destruction processes, we can predict a regression  or an amplification of the tumor. This kind of kinetic study has  led to the recognition of unexpected features in the interaction  between cytotoxic cells and the tumor. It seems that cytotoxic  cells can confuse dead tumor cells with living ones. As a re­ sult, the destruction of the cancer cells becomes increasingly  difficult.  The question of the limits of complexity has often been  raised. Indeed, the more complex a system is, the more nu­ merous are the types of fluctuations that threaten its stability .  How then, it has been asked, can systems as complex as eco­ logical or human organizations possibly exist? How do they </p><div id="pagenum"><p>221</p></div><p id="page">189 ORDER THROUGH FLUCTUA TIONS  manage to avoid permanent chaos? The stabilizing effect of  communication, of diffusion processes, could be a partial an·  swer to these question s. In complex systems, where species  and individuals interact in many different ways, diffusion and  communication among various parts of the system are likely  to be efficient. There is competition between stabilization  through communication and instability through fluctuati ons.  The outcome of that competition determines the threshold of  stability.  Structural Stability  When can we begin to speak about "evolution" in its proper  sense? As we have seen, dissipative structures require far-from­ equilibrium conditio ns. Yet the reaction diffusion equations con­ tain parameters that can be shifted back to near-equilibrium  conditions. The system can explore the bifurcation diagram in  both directions. Similarly, a liquid can shift from laminar flow  to turbulence and back. There is no definite evolutionary pat·  tern involved.  The situation for models involving the size of the system as  a bifurcation parameter is quite different. Here, growth occur­ ring irreversibly in time produces an irreversible evolution.  But this remains a special case, even if it can be relevant for  morphogenetic development.  Be it in biologica l, ecological, or social evolution, we cannot  take as given either a definite set of interacting units, or a defi­ nite set of transformations of these units. The definition of the  system is thus liable to be modified by its evolution. The sim­ plest example of this kind of evolution is associated with the  concept of structural stability. It concerns the reaction of a  given system to the introduction of new units able to multiply  by taking part in the system' s processe s.  The problem of the stability of a system vis-a-vis this kind of  change may be formulated as follows: the new constituents, in­ troduced in small quantiti es, lead to a new set of reactions among  the system' s components. This new set of reactions then en­ ters into competition with the system· s previous mode of func­ tioning. If the system is "structurally stable" as far as this </p><div id="pagenum"><p>222</p></div><p id="page">ORDER OUT OF CHAOS 190  intrusion is concerned, the new mode of functioning will be  unable to establish itself and the "innovators " will not survive.  If, however , the structural fluctuation successfully imposes it­ self-if, for example, the kinetics whereby the "innovators"  multiply is fast enough for the latter to invade the system in­ stead of being destroyed-t he whole system will adopt a new  mode of functioni ng: its activity will be governed by a new  "syntax. "6  The simplest example of this situation is a population of  macromolecules reproduced by polymerization inside a sys­ tem being fed with the monomers A and B. Let us assume the  polymerization process to be autocatalytic -that is, an already  synthesized polymer is used as a model to form a chain having  the same sequence. This kind of synthesis is much faster than  a synthesis in which there is no model to copy. Each type of  polymer , characterized by a particular sequence of A and B,  can be described by a set of parameters measuring the speed  of the synthesis of the copy it catalyzes, the accuracy of the  copying process, and the mean life of the macromolecule it­ self. It may be shown that, under certain conditions, a single  type of polymer having a sequence, shall we say, ABABABA ...  dominates the population, the other polymers being reduced  to mere "fluctuatio ns" with respect to the first. The. problem  of structural stability arises each time that, as a result of a  copying "error," a new type of polymer characterized by a  hitherto unknown sequence and by a new set of parameters  appears in the system and begins to multiply , competing with  the dominant species for the available A and B monomers.  Here we encounter an elementary case of the classic Darwin­ ian idea of the "survival of the fittest."  Such ideas form the basis for the model of prebiotic evolu­ tion developed by Eigen and his coworkers. The details of  Eigen's argument are easily accessible elsewhe re.? Let us  briefly state that it seems to show that there is only one type of  system that can resist the "errors" that autocatalytic popula­ tions continually make-a polymer system structurally stable  for any possible "mutant polymer ." This system is composed  of two sets of polymer molecules. The molecules of the first  set are of the "nucleic acid" type; each molecule is capable of  reprod ucing itself and acts as a catalyst in the synthesis of </p><div id="pagenum"><p>223</p></div><p id="page">191 ORDER THROUGH FLUCTUA TIONS  a molecule of the second set, which is of the proteic type: each  molecule of this second set catalyzes the self-reproduction of a  molecule of the first set. This transcatalytic association be­ tween molecules of the two sets may turn into a cycle (each  "nucleic acid" reproduces itself with the help of a "protein").  It is then capable of stable survival, sheltered from the con­ tinual emergence of new polymers with higher reproductive  efficiency: indeed, nothing can intrude into the self-replicating  cycle formed by "proteins" and "nucleic acids." A new kind  of evolution may thus begin to grow on this stable foundatio n,  heralding the genetic code.  Eigen 's approach is certainly of great interest. Darwinian  selection for faithful self-reproduction is certainly importa nt  in an environment with a limited capacity . But we tend to be­ lieve that this is not the only aspect involved in pre biotic evolu­ tion. The "far-from-equilibrium" conditions related to critical  amounts of flow of energy and matter are also important. It  seems reasonable to assume that some of the first stages mov­ ing toward life were associated with the formation of mecha­ nisms capable of absorbing and transforming chemical energy,  so as to push the system into "far-from-equilibrium" condi­ tions. At this stage life, or "prelife ," probably was so diluted  that Darwinian selection did not play the essential role it did in  later stages.  Much of this book has centered around the relation between  the microscopic and the macroscopic. One of the most impor­ tant problems in evolutionary theory is the eventual feedbac k  between macroscopic structures and microscopic events: mac­ roscopic structures emerging from microscopic events would  in turn lead to a modification of the microscopic mechani sms.  Curiously, at present, the better understood cases concern so­ cial situations. When we build a road or a bridge, we can pre­ dict how this will affect the behavior of the population, and  this will in turn determine other modifications of the modes of  commun ication in the region. Such interrelated processes gen­ erate very complex situations, the understanding of which is  needed before any kind of modelization. This is why what we  will now describe are only very simple cases. </p><div id="pagenum"><p>224</p></div><p id="page">ORDER OUT OF CHAOS 192  Logistic Evolution  In social cases, the problem of structural stability has a large  number of applications. But it must be emphasized that such  applications imply a drastic simplification of a situation de­ fined simply in terms of competition between self-replicating  processes in an environment where only a limited amount of  the needed resources exists.  In ecology the classic equation for such a problem is called  the "logistic equation." This equation describes the evolution  of a population containing N individuals, taking into account  the birthrate, the death rate, and the amount of resources avail­ able to the population. The logistic equation can be written  dN/dt = rN(K-N)-mN, where r and m are characteristic  birth and death constants and K the "carrying capacity" of the  environment. Whatever the initial value of N, as time goes on  it will reach the steady-state value N = K-mlr determined by  the differences of the carrying capacity and the ratio of death  and birth constants. When this value is reached, the environ- K-..!Il  r N  t  Figure 20. Evolution of a population N as a function of time t accord ing to  the logistic curve.

The apparent simplicity of the logistic equation conceals to  some extent the complexity of the mechanisms involved. We  have already mentioned the effect of external noise, for exam­ ple. Here it has an especially simple meanin g. Obviou sly, if  only because of climatic fluctuations, the coefficients K, m,  and r cannot be taken as constant. We know that such fluctua­ tions can completely upset the ecological equilibrium and  even drive the population to extincti on. Of course, as a result,  new processes, such as the storage of food and the formation  of new colonies, will begin and eventually evolve so that some  effects of external fluctuation may be avoided.  But there is more. Instead of writing the logistic equation as  continuous in time, let us compare the population at fixed time  intervals (for example, separated by a year). This "discrete"  logistic equation can be written in the form Nt + 1 = Nt(l + r  [1-N/KJ), wliere Nt and Nt+ 1 are the populations separated  by a one-year interval (we neglect here the death term). The  remarkable feature, noted by R. May,8 is that such equations,  in spite of their simplicity , admit a bewildering number of solu ·  tions. For values of the parameter O�r�2, we have, as in the  continuous case, a uniform approach to equilibrium. For val­ ues of r lower than 2.444, a limit cycle sets in: we now have a  periodic behavior with a two-year period. This is followed by  four-, eight-, etc., year cycles, until the behavior can only be  described as chaotic (if r is larger than 2.57). Here we have a  transition to chaos as described in Chapter V. Does this chaos  arise in nature? Recent studies9 seem to indicate that the pa­ rameters characterizing natural populations keep them from  the chaotic region. Why is this so? Here we have one of the  very interesting problems created by the confluence of evolu­ tionary problems with the mathematics produced by computer  simulation.  Up to now we have taken a static point of view. Let us now  move to mechanisms, whereby the parameters K, r, and m  may vary during biological or ecological evolution.  We have to expect that during evolution the values of the  ecological parameters K, r, and m will vary (as well as many  other parameters and variables, whether they are quantifiable  or not). Living societies continually introduce new ways of ex-</p><div id="pagenum"><p>226</p></div><p id="page">ORDER OUT OF CHAOS 194  ploiting exi.;ting resources or of discovering new ones (that is,  K increases) and continually discover new ways of extending  their lives or of multiplying more quickly. Each ecological  equilibrium defined by the logistic equation is thus only tem­ porary, and a logistically defined niche will be occupied suc­ cessively by a series of species , each capable of ousting the  preceding one when its "aptitude" for exploiting the niche, as  measured by the quantity K-mlr, becomes greater. (See Fig­ ure 21.) Thus the logistic equation leads to the definition of a  very simple situation where we can give a quantitative for­ mulation of the Darwinian idea of the "survival of the fittest."  The "fittest" is the species for which at a given time the quan­ tity K-mlr is the largest.  As restricted as the problem described by the logistic equa­ tion is, it nonetheless leads to some marvelous examples of  nature's inventiveness.  Take the example of caterpillars, who must remain un­ detected, since the slowness of their movement <makes escape  imposs ible.  The evolved strategies of using poisons and irritating hairs  and spines, as well as intimidating displays, are highly effec­ tive in repelling birds and other potential predators.

The ideal strategy  is to remain totally undetected. Some caterpillars approach  this ideal, and the variety and sophistication of the strategies  used by the hundreds of lepidopteran species to remain un­ detected bring to mind the words of distinguished nineteenth­ century naturalist Louis Agassiz: "The possibilities of exis­ tence run so deeply into the extravagant that there is scarcely  any conception too extraordinary for Nature to realize. " IO  We cannot resist giving an example reported by Milton  Love.'' The sheep liver trematode has to pass from an ant to a  sheep, where it will finally reproduce itself. The chances of  sheep swallowing an infected ant are very small, but the ant  behaves in a remarkable way: it starts to maximize the proba­ bility of its encounter with a sheep. The trematode has truly  "body snatched" its host. It has burrowed into the ant's brain,  compelling its victim to behave in a suicidal way: the pos­ sessed ant, instead of staying on the ground , climbs to the tip  of a blade of grass and there, immobile, waits for a sheep. This  is indeed an incredibly "clever " solution to the parasites prob­ lem. How it was selected remains a puzzle.  Other situations in biological evolution may be investigated  using models similar to the logistic equation. For instance, it is  possible to calculate the conditions of interspecies competi­ tion under which it may be advantageous for a fraction of the  population to specialize in warlike and nonproductive activity  (for example , the "soldiers " among the social insects). We can  also determine the kind of environment in which a species that  has become specialized , that has restricted the range of its  food resources , will survive more easily than a nonspecialized  species that consumes a wider range of resources. t2 But here  we are approaching some very different problems, which con­ cern the organization of internally differentiated populations.  Clear distinctions are absolutely necessary if we are to avoid  confusion. In populations where individuals are not inter­ changeable and where each, with its own memory, character,  and experien ce, is called upon to play a singular role, the rele­ vance of the logistic equation and, more generally, of any sim­ ple Darwinian reasoning becomes quite relative. We shall  return to this problem.  It is interesting to note that the type of curve represented in </p><div id="pagenum"><p>228</p></div><p id="page">ORDER OUT OF CHAOS 196  Figure 21 showing the succession of growths and peaks de­ fined by a given logistic equation's family with increasing  K -mlr has also been used to describe the multiplication of  certain technical procedures or products. Here too, the dis­ covery or introduction of a new technique or product breaks  some kind of social, technological, or economic equilibrium.  This equilibrium would correspond to the maximum reached  by the growth curve of the techniques or products with which  the innovation is going to have to compete and that play a simi­ lar role in the situation described by the equation. 13 Thus, to  choose but one example, not only did the spread of the steam­ ship lead to the disappearance of most sailing ships, but, by  reducing the cost of transpor tation and increasing its speed, it  caused an increase in the demand for sea transport ("K") and  consequently an increase in the population of ships. We are  obviously representing here an extremely simple situation,  supposedly governed by purely economic logic. Indeed, in  this case innovation seems merely to satisfy, albeit in a dif­ ferent way, a preexisting need that remains unchanged. How­ ever, in ecology as in human societies, many innovations are  successful without such a preexisting "niche." Such innova­ tions transform the environment in which they appear, and as  they spread, they create the conditions necessary for their  own multiplication. their "niche." In social situations. in par­ ticular, the creation of a "demand," and even of a "need" for  this demand to fulfill, often appears as correlated with the pro­ duction of the goods or techniques that satisfy the demand.  Evolutionary Feedback  A first step toward accounting for this dimension of the evolu­ tionary process can be achieved by making the "carrying ca­ pacity" of a system a function of the way it is exploited instead  of taking it as given.  In this way some supplementary dimensions of economic  activities, and more particularly the "multiplying effects," can  be represented. Thus we can describe the self-accelerating  properties of systems and the spatial differentiation between  different levels of activity. </p><div id="pagenum"><p>229</p></div><p id="page">197 ORDER THROUGH FLUCTUA TIONS  Geographers have already constructed a model correlating  these process es, the Christaller model, defining the optimal  spatial distribution of centers of economic activity. Important  centers would be at the intersection of an hexagonal network,  each being surrounded by a ring of towns of the next smallest  size, each being, etc .... Obviously, in actual cases, such a  regular hierarchical distribution is very infreque nt: historical ,  political, and geographical factors abound, disrupting the spa­ tial symmetry. But there is more. Even if all the important  sources of asymmetrical development were excluded and we  started from a homogeneous economic and geographical space,  the modeling of the genesis of a distribution such as defined by  Christaller establishes that the kind of static optimalization he  describes constitutes a possible but quite unlikely result of the  process.  The model in question 14 stages only the minimal set of vari­ ables implied by a calculation such as Christaller. A set of  equations extending the logistic equations is constructed ,  starting from the basic supposition that populations tend to  migrate as a function of local levels of economic activity,  which thus define a kind of local "carrying capacity," here  reduced to an "emplo yment" capacity. But the local popula­ tion is.also a potential consumer for locally produced goods.  We have, in fact, a double positive feedback, called the "urban  multiplier, " for a local developm ent: both the local population  and the economic infrastructu te produced by the already at­ tained level of activity accelerate the increase of this activity.  But each local level of activity is also determined by competi­ tion with similar centers of activity located elsewhere. The  sale of produced goods or services depends on the cost of  transporting them to consumers and on the size of the "enter­ prise." The expansion of each such enterprise depends on a  demand that this expansion itself helps to create and for which  it competes. Thus the respective growth of population and  manufacturing or service activities is linked by strong feed­ back and nonlinearities .  The model starts with a hypothetical initial condition, where  "level 1" activity (rural) exists at the different points; it then  permits us to follow successive launchings of activities corre­ sponding to "superior" levels in Christaller' s hierarchy -that  is, implying exportation oo a greater range.

The different computer simulations show growth and decay,  capture and domination, periods of opportunity for alternative  developments followed by solidification of the existing domi­ nation structures.

As Waddington empha­ sized, at present we have very little understanding of how a  complex system is likely to respond to a given change. Of ten  this response runs counter to our intuition. The term .. coun­ terintuitive " was introduced at MIT to express our frustration:  .. The damn thing just does not do what it should do!" To take  the classic example cited by Waddington, a program of slum  clearance results in a situation worse than before. New build­ ings attract a larger number of people into the area, but if there  are not enough jobs for them, they remain poor, and their  dwellings become even more overcrowded.t5 We are trained to  think in terms of linear causality, but we need new "tools of  thought": one of the greatest benefits of models is precisely to  help us discover these tools and learn how to use them.  As we have already emphasized, logistic equations are most  relevant when the crucial dimension is the growth of a popula-</p><div id="pagenum"><p>236</p></div><p id="page">ORDER OUT OF CHAOS 204  tion, be it of animals, activities, or habits. What is presup­ posed is that each member of a given population can be taken  as the equivalent of any of the others. But this general equiv­ alence can itself be seen not as a simple general fact but as an  approximation, the validity of which depends on the con­ straints and pressures to which this population was submitted  and on the strategy it used to cope with them.  Take, for example, the distinction ecologists have proposed  between K and r strategies. K and r refer to the parameters in  logistic equations. Though this distinction is only relative, it is  especially clear when it characterizes the divergence resulting  from a systematic interaction between two populations, par­ ticularly the prey-predator interaction. In this view, the typical  evolution for a prey population will be the increase in the re­ production rate r. The predator will evolve toward more effec­ tive ways of capturing its prey-that is, toward an amelioration  of K. But this amelioration, defined in a logistic frame, is liable  to have consequences that go beyond the situations defined by  logistic equations.  As Stephen 1. Gould remarked, 16 a K strategy implies indi­ viduals becoming more and more able to learn from experi­ ence and to store memories-that is, individuals more  complex with a longer period of maturation and apprentice­ ship. This in turn means individuals both more "valuable" ­ representing a larger biological investment-and charac­ terized by a longer period of vulnerabili ty. The development of  "social" and "family" ties thus appears as a logical counter­ part of the K strategy . From that point on, other factors, be­ sides the mere number of individuals in the population,  become more and more relevant and the logistic equation mea­ suring the success by the number of individuals becomes mis­ leading. We have here a particular example of what makes  modelization so risky. In complex systems, both the definition  of entities and of the interactions among them can be modified  by evolution. Not only each state of a system but also the very  definition of the system as modelized is generally unstable, or  at least metastable.  We come to problems where methodology cannot be sepa­ rated from the question of the nature of the object investi­ gated. We cannot ask the same questions about a population of  flies that reproduce and die by millions without apparently </p><div id="pagenum"><p>237</p></div><p id="page">205 ORDER THROUGH FLUCTUATIONS  learning from or enlarging their experience and about a popu­ lation of primates where each individual is an entanglement of  its own experiences and the traditions of the populations in  which he lives.  We also find that, within anthropology itself, basic choices  must be made between various approaches to collective phe­ nomena. It is well known, for example, that structural an­ thropology privileges those aspects of society where the tools  of logic and finite mathematics can be used, aspects such as  the elementary structures of kinship or the analysis of myths,  whose transformations are often compared to crystalline  growth. Discrete elements are counted and combined . This  contrasts with approaches that analyze evolution in terms of  processes involving large, partially chaotic populations. We  are dealing with two different outlooks and two types of mod­ els: Levi-Strauss defines them respectively as "mechanical"  and "statistical ." In the mechanical model "the elements are  of the same scale as the phenomena" and individual behavior  is based on prescriptions referring to the structural organiza­ tion of society. The anthropologist makes the logic of this be­ havior explicit. The sociologi st, on the other hand, works with  statistical models for large populations and defines averages  and thresholds.I7  A society defined entirely in terms of a functional model  would correspond to the Aristotelian idea of natural hierarchy  and order. Each official would perform the duties for which he  has been appointed. These duties would translate at each level  the different aspects of the organization of the society as a  whole. The king gives orders to the architect, the architect to  the contractor, the contr actor to the workers. Everywhere a  mastermind is at work. On the contrary, termites and other  social insects seem to approach the "statistical" model. As we  have seen, there seems to be no mastermind behind the con­ struction of the termites' nest, when interactions among indi­ viduals produce certain types of collective behavior in some  circumstan ces, but none of these interactions refer to any  global task, being all purely local. Such a description neces­ sarily implies averages and reintroduces the question of sta­ bility and bifurcations.  Which events will regress, and which arc likely to affect the  whole system? What are the situations of choice, and what are </p><div id="pagenum"><p>238</p></div><p id="page">ORDER OUT OF CHAOS 206  the regimes of stability? Since size or the system's density  may play the role of a bifurcation parameter , how may purely  quantitative growth lead to qualitatively new choices? Ques­ tions such as these call for an ambitious program indeed. As  with the rand K strategies, they lead us to connect the choice  of a "good" model for social behavior and history. How does  the evolution of a population lead it to become more "mechan­ ical"? This question seems parallel to questions we have al­ ready met in biology. How, for example, does the selection of  the genetic information governing the rates and regulations of  metabolic reactions favor certain paths to such an extent that  development seems to be purposive or appear as the transla­ tion of a "message"?  We believe that models inspired by the concept of "order  through fluctuations" will help us with these questions and  even permit us in some circumstances to give a more precise  formulation to the complex interplay between individual and  collective aspects of behavior. From the physicist' s point of  view, this involves a distinction between states of the system  in which all individual initiative is doomed to insignificance on  the one hand, and on the other, bifurcation regions in which an  individual, an idea, or a new behavior can upset the global  state. Even in those regions, amplification obviously does not  occur with just any individual, idea, or behavior, but only with  those that are "dangerous"-that is, those that can exploit to  their advantage the nonlinear relations guaranteeing the sta­ bility of the preceding regime. Thus we are led to conclude  that the same nonlinearities may produce an order out of the  chaos of elementary processes and still, under different cir­ cumstances, be responsible for the destruction of this same  order, eventually producing a new coherence beyond another  bifurcation.  "Order through fluctuations" models introduce an unstable  world where small causes can have large effects, but this world  is not arbitrary . On the contrary, the reasons for the amplifica­ tion of a small event are a legitimate matter for rational inquiry.  Fluctuations do not cause the transformation of a systefll 's ac­ tivity. Obviously , to use an image inspired by Maxwell, the  match is responsible for the forest fire, but reference to a  match does not suffice to understand the fire. Moreover, the  fact that a fluctuation evades control does not mean that we </p><div id="pagenum"><p>239</p></div><p id="page">207 ORDER THROUGH FLUCTUATIONS  cannot locate the reasons for the instability its amplification  causes.  An Open World  In view of the complexity of the questions raised here, we can  hardly avoid stating that the way in which biological and social  evolution has traditionally been interpreted represents a par­ ticularly unfortunate use of the concepts and methods bor­ rowed from physics 18-unfortunate because the area of  physics where these concepts and methods are valid was very  restricted, and thus the analogies between them and social or  economic phenomena are completely unjustified.  The foremost example of this is the paradigm of optimiza­ tion. It is obvious that the management of human society as  well as the action of selective pressures tends to optimize  some aspects of behaviors or modes of connection , but to con­ sider optimization as the key to understanding how popula­ tions and individuals survive is to risk conf using causes with  effects.  Optimization models thus ignore both the possibility of radi­ cal transformation s-that is, transformations that change the  definition of a problem and thus the kind of solution sought­ and the inertial constraints that may eventually force a system  into a disastrous way of functioning. Like doctrines such as  Adam Smith's invisible hand or other definitions of progress in  terms of maximization or minimization criteria, this gives a  reassuring representation of nature as an all-powerful and ra­ tional calculator, and of a coherent history characterized by  global progress. To restore both inertia and the possibility of  unanticipated events-that is, restore the open character of  history-we must accept its fundamental uncertainty. Here we  could use as a symbol the apparently accidental character of  the great cretaceous extinction that cleared the path for the  development of mammal s, a small group of ratlike creatures.'�  This has been a general presentation, a kind of "bird's-eye  view," and thus has omitted many topics of great interest:  flames, plasmas, and lasers, for example, present nonequilib­ rium instabilities of great theoretical and practical interest. </p><div id="pagenum"><p>240</p></div><p id="page">ORDER OUT OF CHAOS 208  Everywh ere we look, we find a nature that is rich in diversity  and innovations. The conceptual evolution we have described  is itself embedded in a wider history, that of the progressive  rediscovery of time.  We have seen new aspects of time being progressively incor­ porated into physics, while the ambitions to omniscience in­ herent in classical science were progressively rejected. In this  chapter we have moved from physics through biology and  ecology to human society, but we could have proceeded in the  inverse order. Indeed, history began by concentrating mainly  on human societies, after which attention was given to the  temporal dimensions of life and of geology. The incorpora tion  of time into physics thus appears as the last stage of a pro­ gressive reinsertion of history into the natural and social sci­ ences.  Curiously , at every stage of the process, a decisive feature of  this "historiciza tion" has been the discovery of some temporal  heterogeneity . Since the Renaissa nce, Western society has  come into contact with different populations that were seen as  corresponding to different stages of development; nineteenth­ century biology and geology learned to discover and classify  fossils and to recognize in landscapes the memories of a past  with which we coexist; finally, twentieth-century physics has  also discovered a kind of fossil, residual black-body radiation,  which tells us about the beginnings of the universe. Today we  know that we live in a world where different interlocked times  and the fossils of many pasts coexist.  We must now proceed to another question. We have said  that life is starting to seem as "natural as a falling body." What  has the natural process of self-organization to do with a falling  body? What possible link can there be between dynamic s, the  science of force and trajectories, and the science of complex­ ity and becoming, the science of living processes and of the  natural evolution of which they are part? At the end of the  nineteenth century, irreversibility was associated with the phe­ nomena of friction, viscosity , and heating. Irreversibility lay at  the origin of energy losses and waste. At that time it was still  possible to subscribe to the fiction that irreversibility was only  a result of our ineptitude, of our unsophisti cated machines,  and that nature remained fundamentally reversible. Now it is </p><div id="pagenum"><p>241</p></div><p id="page">209 ORDER THROUGH FLUCTUATIONS  no longer possible: today even physics tells us that irreversible  processes play a constructive and indispens able role.  So we come to a question that can be avoided no longer.  What is the relation between this new science of complexity  and the science of simple, elementary behavior? What is the  relation between these two opposing views of nature? Are  there two sciences, two truths for a single world? How is that  possible?  In a certain sense, we have come back to the beginning of  modern science. Now, as at Newton's time, two sciences  come face to face-the science of gravitation, which describes  an atemporal nature subject to laws, and the science of fire,  chemistr y. We now understand why it was impossible for the  first synthesis produced by science, the Newtonian synthesis,  to be complete ; the forces of interaction described by dynam­ ics cannot explain the complex and irreversible behavior of  matter. Ignis mutat res. According to this ancient saying,  chemical structures are the creatures of fire, the results of irre­ versible processes. How can we bridge the gap between being  and becoming-two concepts in conflict, yet both necessary  to reach a coherent description of this strange world in which  we live? </p><div id="pagenum"><p>242</p></div><p id="page"></p><div id="pagenum"><p>243</p></div><p id="page">BOOK THREE  FROM BEING TO  BECOMING </p><div id="pagenum"><p>244</p></div><p id="page">I  I  I I  I I  I  I </p><div id="pagenum"><p>245</p></div><p id="page">CHAPTER VII  REDISCOVERING TIME  A Change of Emphasis  Whitehead wrote that a "clash of doctrines is not a disaster, it  is an opportunity ." t If this statement is true, few opportunities  in the history of science have been so promising: two worlds  have come face to face, the world of dynamics and the world of  thermodyna mics.  Newtonian science was the outcome , the crowning syn­ thesis of centuries of experimentation as well as of converging  lines of theoretical research. The same is true for thermo­ dynamics. The growth of science is quite different from the  uniform unfolding of scientific disciplines, each in turn divided  into an increasing number of watertight compartments. Quite  the contrary, the convergence of different problems and points  of view may break open the compartments and stir up scien­ tific culture. These turning points have consequences that go  beyond their scientific context and influence the intellectual  scene as a whole. Inversely , global problems often have been  sources of inspiration to science.  The clash of doctrines, the conflict between being and be­ coming, indicates that a new turning point has been reached,  that a new synthesis is needed. Such a synthesis is taking  shape today, every bit as unexpected as the preceding ones.  We again find a remarkab le convergence of research, all of  which contributes to identifying the difficulties inherent in the  Newtonian concept of a scientific theory .  The ambition of Newtonian science was to present a vision  of nature that would be universal, deterministic, and objective  inasmuch as it contains no reference to the observer, complete  inasmuch as it attains a level of description that escapes the  clutches of time.  213 </p><div id="pagenum"><p>246</p></div><p id="page">ORDER OUT OF CHAOS 214  We have reached the core of the problem. "What is time?''  Must we accept the opposition, traditional since Kant, be­ tween the static time of classical physics and the existential  time we experience in our lives? According to Carnap:  Once Einstein said that the problem of the Now wor­ ried him seriously . He explained that the experience of  the Now means something special for man, something  essentially different from the past and the future, but  that this important difference does not and cannot occur  within physics. That this experience cannot be grasped  by science seemed to him a matter of painful but inevita­ ble resignation. I remarked that all that occurs objec­ tively can be described in science; on the one hand the  temporal sequence of events is described in physics; and,  on the other hand, the pecul iarities of man's experiences  with respect to time, including his different attitude to­ wards past, present and future, can be described and (in  principle) explained in psycholo gy. But Einstein thought  that these scientific descriptions cannot possibly satisfy  our human nee ds; that there is something essential about  the Now which is just outside of the realm of science.2  It is interesting to note that Bergson, in a sense following an  opposite road, also reached a dualistic conclusion (see Chap­ ter III). Like Einstein, Bergson started with a subjective time  and then moved to time in nature, time as objectified by phys­ ics. However, for him this objectivization led to a debasement  of time. Internal existential time has qualitative features that  are lost in the process. It is for this reason that Bergson intro­ duced the distinction between physical time and duration, a  concept referring to existential time.  But we cannot stop here. As J. T. Fraser says, "The result­ ing dichotomy between time felt and time understood is a hall­ mark of scientific-industrial civilization, a sort of collective  schizophrenia. "3 As we have already emphasized, where clas­ sical science used to emphasize permanence , we now find  change and evolution; we no longer see in the skies the trajec­ tories that filled Kant's heart with the same admiration as the  moral law residing in him. We now see strange objects: qua­ sars,· pulsars, galaxies exploding and being torn apart, stars </p><div id="pagenum"><p>247</p></div><p id="page">215 REDISCOVERING TIME  that, we are told, collapse into "black holes" irreversibly de­ vouring everything they manage to ensnare.  Time has penetrated not only biology, geology, and the so­ cial sciences but also the two levels from which it has been  traditionally excluded , the microscopic and the cosmic. Not  only life, but also the universe as a whole has a history; this  has profound implications.  The first theoretical paper dealing with a cosmological  model from the point of view of general relativity was pub­ lished by Einstein in 1917. It presented a static, timeless view  of the universe, Spinoza's vision translated into physics. But  then comes the unexpected. It became immediately evident  that there were other, time-dependent solutions to Einstein's cos­ mological equations. We owe this discovery to the Russian astro­ physicist A. Friedmann and the Belgian G. Lemaitre. At the  same time Hubble and his coworkers were studying the mo­ tions of galaxies, and they demonstrated that the velocity of  distant galaxies is proportional to their distance from earth.  The relation with the expanding universe discovered by Fried­ mann and Lemaitre was obvious. Yet for many years physi­ cists remained reluctant to accept such an "historical"  description of cosmic evolution. Einstein himself was wary of  it. Lemaitre often said that when he tried to discuss with Ein­ stein the possibility of making the initial state of the universe  more precise and perhaps finding there the explanation of cos­ mic rays, Einstein showed no interest.  Today there is new evidence, the famous residual black­ body radiation, the light that illuminated the explosion of the  hyperdense fireball with which our universe began. The whole  story appears as another irony of history. In a sense, Einstein  has, against his will, become the Darwin of physics. Darwin  taught us that man is embedded in biological evolution; Ein­ stein has taught us that we are embedded in an evolving universe.  Einstein's ideas led him to a new continent, as unexpected to  him as was America to Columbus. Einstein, like many physi­ cists of his gener ation, was guided by a deep conviction that  there was a fundamental , simple level in nature. Yet today this  level is becoming less and less accessible to experiment. The  only objects whose behavior is truly "simple" exist in our own  world, at the macroscopic level. Classical science carefully  chose its objects from this intermed iate range. The first ob-</p><div id="pagenum"><p>248</p></div><p id="page">ORDER OUT OF CHAOS 216  jects singled out by Newton-falling bodies, the pendulum,  planetary motion-were simple. We know now, however, that  this simplicity is not the hallmark of the fundamental: it cannot  be attributed to the rest of the world.  Does this suffice? We now know that stability and simplicity  are exceptions. Should we merely disregard the totalizing to­ talitarian claims of a conceptualization that, in fact, applies  only to simple and stable ob jects? Why worry about the in­ compatibility between dynamics and thermodynami cs?  We must not forget the words of Whitehead, words con­ stantly confirmed by the history of science: a clash of doc­ trines is an opportunity , not a disaster. It has often been  suggested that we simply ignore certain issues for practical  reasons on the grounds that they are based on idealizations  that are difficult to implement. At the beginning of this cen­ tury, several physicists suggested abandoning determinism on  the grounds that it was inaccessible in real experience. 4 In­ deed, as we have already emphasized, we never know the ex­ act positions and velocities of the molecules in a large system;  thus an exact prediction of the system's future evolution is im­ possible. More recently, Brillouin hoped to destroy determi­ nism by appealing to the commonsense truth that accurate  prediction requires an accurate knowledge of the initial condi­ tions and that this knowledge must be paid for; the exact pre­ diction necessary to make determinism work requires that an  "infinite" price be paid.  These objections, while reasonable, do not affect the con­ ceptual world of dynamic s. They shed no new light on reality.  Moreover , the improvements in technology could bring us  closer and closer to the idealization implied by classical dy­ namics.  In contrast, demonstrations of "impossibility" have a fun­ damental importance. They imply the discovery of an unex­ pected intrinsic structure of reality that dooms an intellectual  enterprise to failure. Such discoveries will exclude the pos­ sibility of an operation that previously could have been imag­ ined as feasible, at least in principle . "No engine can have an  efficiency greater than one," "no heat engine can produce  useful work unless it is in contact with two sources" are exam­ ples of statements of impossib ility which have led to profound  conceptual innovations. </p><div id="pagenum"><p>249</p></div><p id="page">217 .REDISCOVERING TIME  Thermodyna mics, relativity, and quantum mechanics are all  rooted in the discovery of impossibilitie s, of limits to the ambi­ tions of classical physics. Thus they marked the end of an ex­ ploration that had reached its limits. But we can now see these  scientific innovations in a different light, not as an end but a  beginning, as the opening up of new opportuni ties. We shall  see in Chapter IX that the second law of thermodynamics ex­ presses an "impossibility," even on the microscopic level, but  even there the newly discovered impossibility becomes a start·  ing point for the emergence of new concepts.  The End of Universality  Scientific description must be consistent with the resources  available to an observer who belongs to the world he describes  and cannot refer to some being who contempla tes the physical  world "from the outside." This is one of the fundamental re­ quirements of relativity theory. In connection with the prop­ agation of signals a limit appears that cannot be transgressed  by any observer . Indeed, c, the velocity of light in vacuum  (c=300,000 km/sec), is the limiting velocity for the propaga­ tion of all signals. Thus this limiting velocity plays a funda­ mental role. It limits the region in space that may influence the  point wher e an observer is located.  There is no universal constant in Newtonian physics. This is  the reason for its claim to universality, why it can be applied in  the same way whatever the scale of the objects: the motion of  atoms, planets, and stars are governed by a single law.  The discovery of universal constants signified a radical  change. Using the velocity of light as the comparison stan­ dard, physics has established a distinction between low and  high velocities, those approaching the speed of light.  Likewise, Planck's constant, h; sets up a natural scale ac­ cording to the object's mass. The atom can no longer be re­ garded as a tiny planetary system. Electrons belong to a  different scale than planets and all other heavy, slow-moving,  macroscopic objects, including ourselves.  Universal constants not only destroy the homogeneity of the  universe by introducing physical scales in terms of which vari-</p><div id="pagenum"><p>250</p></div><p id="page">ORDER OUT OF CHAOS 218  ous behaviors become qualitatively different, they also lead to  a new conception of objectivity. No observer can transmit sig­ nals at a velocity higher than that of light in a vacuum. Hence  Einstein's remarkable conclusion: we can no longer define the  absolute simultaneity of two distant events; simultaneity can  be defined only in terms of a given reference frame. The scope  of this book does not permit an extensive account of relativity  theory. Let us merely point out that Newton's laws did not  assume that the observer was a "physical being." Objective  description was defined precisely as the absence of any refer­ ence to its author. For "nonphysical" intelligent beings capa­ ble of communicating at an infinite velocity , the laws of  relativity would be irrelevant. The fact that relativity is based  on a constraint that applies only to physically localized ob­ servers, to beings who can be in only one place at a time and  not everywhere at once, gives this physics a "human" quality.  This does not mean, however, that it is a "subjective" physics,  the result of our preferences and convictions; it remains sub­ ject to intrinsic constraints that identify us as part of the physi­ cal world we are describing. It is a physics that presupposes an  observer situated within the observed world . .Our dialogue  with nature will be successful only if it is carried on from  within nature.  The Rise of Quantum Mechanics  Relativity altered the classical concept of objectivity. How­ ever, it left unchanged another fundamental characteristic of  classical physics, namely, the ambition to achieve a "com­ plete" description of nature. After relativity, physicists could  no longer appeal to a demon who observed the entire universe  from outside, but they could still conceive of a supreme math­ ematician who, as Einstein claimed, neither cheats nor plays  dice. This mathematician would possess the formula of the  universe, which would include a complete description of na­ ture. In this sense, relativity remains a continuation of classi­ cal physics.  Quantum mechanics, on the other hand, is the first physical  theory truly to have broken with the past. Quantum mechan­ ics not only situates us in nature, it also labels us as "heavy" </p><div id="pagenum"><p>251</p></div><p id="page">219 REDISCOV ERING TIME  beings composed of a macroscopic number of atoms. In order  to visualize more clearly the consequences of the velocity of  light as a universal constant , Einstein imagined himself riding  a photon. But quantum mechanics discovered that we are too  heavy to ride photons or electrons. We cannot possibly replace  such airy beings, identify ourselves with them, and describe  what they would think, if they were able to think, and what  they would experience , if they were able to feel anything.  The history of quantum mechanics, like that of all con­ ceptual innovations, is complex , full of unexpected events; it is  the history of a logic whose implications were discovered long  after it was conceived in the urgency of experiment and in a  difficult political and cultural environment.5 This history can­ not be related here; we only wish to emphasize its role in the  construction of the bridge from being to becoming, which is  our main subject.  The birth of quantum mechanics was in itself part of the  quest for this bridge. Planck was interested in the interaction  between matter and radiation. Underlying his work was the  ambition to accomplish for the matter-light interaction what  Boltzmann had achieved for the matter-matter interaction,  namely, to discover a kinetic model for irreversible processes  leading to equilibrium. 6 To his surprise, he was forced, in or­ der to reach experimental results valid at thermal equilibrium,  to assume that an exchange of energy between matter and ra­ diation occurred only in discrete steps involving a new univer­ sal constant. This universal constant "h" measures the "size"  of each step.  In this case, as in many others, the challenge of irreversibil­ ity led to decisive progress in physics.  This discovery remained isolated until Einstein presented  the first general interpretation of Planck's constant. He un­ derstood that it had far-reaching implications for the nature of  light. He introduced a revolutionary concept: the wave­ particle duality of light.  Since the beginning of the nineteenth century, light had  been associated with wave properties manifest in phenomena  such as diffraction or interference. However, at the end of the  nineteenth century, new phenomena were discovered, notably  the photoelectric effect-that is, the expulsion of electrons as  the result of the absorption of light. These new experimental </p><div id="pagenum"><p>252</p></div><p id="page">ORDER OUT OF CHAOS 220  results were difficult to explain in terms of the traditional wave  properties of light. Einstein solved the riddle by assuming that  light may be both wave and particle and that these two aspects  are related through Planck's constant. More precisely, a light  wave is characterized by its frequency u and its wavelength X;  h permits us to go from frequency and wavelength to mechani­ cal quantities such as energy e and momentum p. The relations  between u and A on the one side and e and p on the other are  Very simple: B = hu, p = h/X, and both involve h. 1\.venty years  later, Louis de Broglie extended this wave-particle duality  from light to matter; thus the starting point for the modern  formulation of quantum mechanics.  In 1913 Niels Bohr had linked the new quantum physics to  the structure of atoms (and later of molecules). As a result of  the wave-particle duality, he showed that there exist discrete  sequences of electron orbits. When an atom is excited, the  electron jumps from one orbit to another. At this very instant  the atom emits or absorbs a photon the frequency of which  corresponds to the difference between the energies charac­ terizing the electron's motion in each of the two orbits. This  difference is calculated in terms of Einstein's formula relating  energy to frequency.  Thus we reach the decisive years 1925-27, a "golden age" of  physics.7 During this short period, Heisenberg, Born, Jordan,  Schrodinger, and Dirac made quantum physics into a consis­ tent new theory. This theory incorporates Einstein's and de  Broglie's wave-particle duality in the framework of a new gen­ eralized form of dynamics: quantum mechanic s. For our pur­ poses here, the conceptual novelty of quantum mechanics is  essential.  First and foremost, a new formulation, unknown in classical  physics, had to be introduced to allow "quantitization" to be  incorporated into the theoretical language. The essential fact  is that an atom can be found only in discrete energy levels  corresponding to the various electron orbits. In particular, this  means that energy (or the Hamiltonian) can no longer be  merely a function of the position and the moment, as it is in  classical mechanics. Otherwise, by giving the positions and  moments slightly different values, energy could be made to  vary continuously . But as observation reveals, only discrete  levels exist. </p><div id="pagenum"><p>253</p></div><p id="page">22'1 REDISCOVERING TIME  We therefore have to replace the conventional idea that the  Hamiltonian is a function of position and momenta with some­ thing new; the basic idea of quantum mechanics is that the  Hamiltonian as well as the other quantities of classical me­ chanics, such as coordinates q or momenta p, now become  operators. This is one of the boldest ideas ever introduced in  science, and we would like to discuss it in detail.  It is a simple idea, even if at first it seems somewhat ab­ stract. We have to distinguish the operator-a mathematical  operation-and the object on which it operates-a function.  As an example, take as the mathematical "operator" the de­ rivative represented by d/dx and suppose it acts on a func­ tion-say, x2; the result of this operation is a new function, this  time "2x." However, certain functions behave in a peculiar  way with respect to derivation. For example, the derivative of  "e3x" is "3e3x": here we return to the original function simply  multiplied by some number-here, 3. Functions that are  merely recovered by a given operator to them are known as the  "eigenfunctions" of this operator, and the numbers by which  the eigenfunction is multiplied after the application of the op­ erator are the "eigenvalues" of the operator.  To each operator there thus corresponds an ensemble, a "res­ ervoir" of numerical values; this ensemble forms its "spec­ trum." This spectrum is "discrete" when the eigenvalues form  a discrete series. There exists, for instance, an operator with  all the integers 0, 1, 2 ... as eigenvalues. A spectrum may  also be continuous- for example, when it consists of all the  numbers between 0 and 1.  The basic concept of quantum mechanics may thus be ex­ pressed as follows: to all physical quantities in classical me­ chanics there corresponds in quantum mechanics an operator,  and the numerical values that may be taken by this physical  quantity are the eigenvalues of this operator. The essential  point is that the concept of physical quantity (represented by  an operator) is now distinct from that of its numerical values  (represented by the eigenvalues of the operator). In particula r,  energy will now be represented by the Hamiltonian operator,  and the energy levels-the observed values of the energy­ will be identified with the eigenvalues corresponding to this  operator.  The introduction of operators opened up to physics a micro-</p><div id="pagenum"><p>254</p></div><p id="page">ORDER OUT OF CHAOS 222  scopic world of unsuspected richness, and we regret that we  cannot devote more space to this fascinating subject, in which  creative imagination and experime ntal observation are so suc­ cessfully combined. Here we wish merely to stress that the  microscopic world is governed by laws having a new structure,  thereby putting an end once and for all to the hope of discover­ ing a single conceptual scheme common to all levels of de­ scription.  A new mathematical language invented to deal with a cer­ tain situation may actually open up fields of inquiry that are  full of surprises, going far beyond the expectations of its orig­ inators. This was true for differential calculus, which lies at  the root of the formulation of classical dynamics. It is true as  well for operator calculus. Quantum theory, initiated as de­ manded by the result of unexpected experime ntal discoveries,  was quick to reveal itself as pregnant with new content.  Today, more than fifty years after the introduction of opera­ tors into quantum mechanic s, their significance remains a sub­ ject of lively discussion. From the historical point of view, the  introduction of operators is linked to the existence of energy  levels, but today operators have applications even in classical  physics. This implies that their significance has been extended  beyond the expectations of the founders of quantum mechan­ ics. Operators now come into play as soon as, for one reason  or another, the notion of a dynamic trajectory has to be dis­ carded, and with it, the deterministic description a trajectory  implies.  Heisenbergs Uncertainty Relation  We have seen that in quantum mechanics to each physical  quantity corresponds an operator that acts on functions. Of  special importance are the eigenfunctions and the eigenvalues  corresponding to the operator under consideration. The eigen­ values correspond precisely to the numerical values the physi­ cal quantity can now take. Let us take a closer look at the  operators quantum mechanics associates with coordinates q  and momenta p; their coordinates are, as we have seen in  Chapter II, the canonical variabl es.  In classical mechanics coordinates and momenta are inde-</p><div id="pagenum"><p>255</p></div><p id="page">223 REDISCOVER ING TIME  pendent in the sense that we can ascribe to a coordinate a  numerical value quite independent of the value we have as­ cribed to the momentu m. However, the existence of Planck's  constant h implies the reduction in the number of independent  variables. We could have guessed this right away from the  Einstein-de Broglie relation A= hlp, which, as we have seen,  connects wavelength to momentum. Planck's constant h ex­ presses a relation between lengths (closely related to the con­ cept of coordinates) and momenta. Therefore, positions and  momenta can no longer be independent variables, as in classi­ cal mechanic s. The operators corresponding to positions and  momenta can be expressed in terms of the coordinate alone or  in terms of the momentum, something explained in all text­ books dealing with quantum mechanic s.  The important point is that in all cases, only one type of  quantity appears (either coordina te or momentum), but not  both. In this sense we may say that the quantum mechanics  divides the number of classical mechanical variables by a fac­ tor of two.  One fundamental property results from the relation between  operators in quantum mechanics: the two operators q0P and  Pop do not commute-t hat is, the results of q0pP0p and of  Pop%p applied to the same function are different. This has pro­ found implications, since only commuting operators admit  common eigenfunctions. Thus we cannot identify a function  that would be an eigenfunction of both coordinate and momen­ tum. As a consequence of the definition of the coordinate and  momentum operators in quantum mechanics, there can be no  state in which the physical quantities, coordinate q and mo­ mentum p, both have a well-defined value. This situation, un­ known in classical mechanics, is expressed by Heisenberg's  famous uncertainty relations. We can measure a coordinate  and a momentu m, but the dispersions of the respective possi­ ble predictions as expressed by f::j,q,f::j,p are related by the  Heisenberg inequality f::j,qf::j,p;;::.h. We can make f::j,q as small as  we want, but then f::j,p goes to infinity, and vice versa.  Much has been written about Heisenber g's uncertainty rela­ tions, and our discussion is admittedly oversimplified. But we  wish to give our readers some understanding of the new prob­ lem that re:sult:s from the u:se of operators; Heisenberg's uncer­ tainty relation necessarily leads to a revision of the concept of </p><div id="pagenum"><p>256</p></div><p id="page">ORDER OUT OF CHAOS 224  causality. It is possible to determine the coordinate precisely.  But the moment we do so, the momentum will acquire an ar­ bitrary value, positive or negative. In other words, in an in­ stant the position of the object will become arbitrari ly distant.  The meaning of localization becomes blurred: the concepts  that form the basis of classical mechanics are profoundly al­ tered.  These consequences of quantum mechanics were unac­ ceptable to many physicists, including Einstein; and many ex­ periments were devised to demonstrate their absurdity . An  attempt was also made to minimize the conceptual change in­ volved. In particular, it was suggested that the foundation of  quantum mechanics is in some way related to perturbations  resulting from the process of observation. A system was  thought to possess intrinsically well-defined mechanical pa­ rameters such as coordinates and momenta; but some of them  would be made fuzzy by measurement, and Heisenberg's un­ certainty relation would only express the perturbation created  by the measurement process. Classical realism thus would re­ main intact on the fundamental level, and we would simply  have to add a positivistic qualification. This interpretation  seems too narrow. It is not the quantum measurement process  that disturbs the results. Far from it: Planck's constant forces  us to revise our concepts of coordinates and momenta. This  conclusion has been confirmed by recent experiments de­ signed to test the assumption of local hidden variables that  were introduced to restore classical determinism. s The results  of those experiments confirm the striking consequences of  quantum mechanics.  That quantum mechanics obliges us to speak less absolutely  about the localization of an object implies, as Niels Bohr often  emphasized , that we must give up the realism of classical  physics. For Bohr, Planck's constant defines the interaction  between a quantum system and the measurement device as  nondecomposable. It is only to the quantum phenomenon as a  whole, including the measurement intera ction, that we can as­ cribe numerical values. All description thus implies a choice  of the measurement device, a choice of the question asked. In  this sense, the answer, the result of the measurement, does not  give us access to a given reality. We have to decide which mea­ surement we are going to perform and which question our ex-</p><div id="pagenum"><p>257</p></div><p id="page">225 REDISCOVERING TIME  periments will ask the system. Thus there is an irreducible  multiplicity of representations for a system, each connected  with a determined set of operators.  This implies a departure from the classical notion of ob­ jectivity, since in the classical view the only "objective" de­ scription is the complete description of the system as it is,  independent of the choice of how it is observed.  Bohr always emphasized the novelty of the positive choice  introduced through measurement. The physicist has to choose  his language, to choose the macroscopic experimental device.  Bohr expressed this idea through the principle of complemen­ tarity,9 which may be considered as an extension of Heisen­ berg's uncertainty relations. We can measure coordinates or  momenta, but not both. No single theoretical language artic­ ulating the variables to which a well-defined value can be at­ tributed can exhaust the physical con�ent of a system. Various  possible languages and points of view about the system may  be compleme ntary. They all deal with the same reality, but it is  impossible to reduce them to one single description. The irre­ ducible plurality of perspectives on the same reality expresses  the impossibili ty of a divine point of view from which the  whole of reality is visible. However, the lesson of the principle  of complement arity is not a lesson in resignation. Bohr used to  say that the significance of quantum mechanics always made  him dizzy, and we do indeed feel dizzy when we are torn from  the comfortable routine of common sense.  The real lesson to be learned from the principle of comple­ mentarity, a lesson that can perhaps be transferred to other  fields of knowledge, consists in emphasizing the wealth of re­ ality, which overflow s any single language , any single logical  structure. Each language can express only part of reality. Mu­ sic, for example, has not been exhausted by any of its realiza­ tions, by any style of composition, from Bach to Schonberg.  We have emphasized the importance of operators because  they demonstrate that the reality studied by physics is also a  mental construct ; it is not merely given. We must distinguish  between the abstract notion of a coordinate or of momentum,  represented mathemati cally by operators, and their numerical  realization, which can be reached through experime nts. One  of the reasons for the opposition between the ··two cultures"  may have been the belief that literature corresponds to a con-</p><div id="pagenum"><p>258</p></div><p id="page">ORDER OUT OF CHAOS 226  ceptualization of reality, to "fiction," while science seems to  express objective "reality." Quantum mechanics teaches us  that the situation is not so simple. On all levels reality implies  an essential element of conceptualizatio n.  The Temporal Evolution of Quantum Systems  We shall now move on to discuss the temporal evolution of  quantum systems. As in classical mechanic s, the Hamiltonian  plays a fundamental role. As we have seen, in quantum me­ chanics it is replaced by the Hamiltonian operator Hop· This  energy operator plays a central role: on the one hand, its  eigenval ues correspond to the energy levels; on the other  hand, as in classical mechanic s, the Hamiltonian operator de­ termines the temporal evolution of the system. In quantum  mechanics the role played by the canonical equation of classi­ cal mechanics is taken by the Schr odinger equation, which  expresses the time evolution of the function character izing the  quantum state as the result of the application of the operator  Hop on the wave function \jJ (there are, of course, other for­ mulations, which we cannot describe here). The term "wave  function" has been chosen to emphasize once again the wave­ particle duality so fundamental in all of quantum physics. \jJ is  a wave amplitude that evolves according to a particle type of  equation determined by the Hamiltonian. Schrodinger's equa­ tion, like the canonical equation of classical physics, ex­ presses a reversible and deterministic evolution. The  reversible change of wave function corresponds to a reversible  motion along a trajectory. If the wave function at a given in­ stant is known, Schrodinger's equation allows it to be calculated  for any previous or subsequent instant. From this viewpoint,  the situation is strictly similar to that in classical mechanic s.  This is because the uncertainty relations of quantum mechan­ ics do not include time. Time remains a number, not an opera­ tor, and only operators can appear in Heisenberg's uncertainty  relations.  Quantum mechanics deals with only half of the variables of  dassical mechanics. As a result, classical determinism be­ comes inapplica ble, and in quantum physics statistical consid-</p><div id="pagenum"><p>259</p></div><p id="page">227 REDISCOVERING TIME  erations play a central role. It is through the wave intensity ttJ2  (the square of the amplitude) that we make contact with statis­ tical consider ations.  The standard statistical interpretation of quantum mechan­ ics runs as follows: consider the eigenfunctions of some opera­ tor-say, the energy operator H0P-and the corresponding  eigenvalues. In general the wave function tts will not be the  eigenfunction of the energy operator, but it can be expressed  as the superposition of these eigenfun ctions. The respective  importance of each eigenfunction in this superposition allows  us to calculate the probability for the appearance of the vari­ ous possible corresponding eigenvalues.  Here again we notice a fundamental departure from classi­ cal theory. Only probabilities can be predicted, not single  events. This was the second time in the history of science that  probabilities were used to explain some basic features of na­ ture. The first time was in Boltzmann's interpretation of en­ tropy. There, however, a subjective point of view remained  possible; in this view, "only" our ignorance in the face of the  complexity of the systems considered prevented us from achiev­ ing a complete description. (We shall see that today it is possible  to overcome this attitude.) Here, as before, the use of proba­ bilities was unacceptable to many physicists -including Ein­ stein-who wished to achieve a "complete" deterministic  description. Just as with irreversibility, an appeal to our igno­ rance seemed to offer a way out: our inaptitude would make us  responsible for statistical behavior in the quantum world, just  as it makes us responsible for irreversibility.  Once again we come to the problem of hidden variables.  However, as we have said, there has been no experimental evi­ dence to justify the introduction of such variables, and the rol�  of probabilities seems irreducible.  There is only one case in which the Schrodinger equation  leads to a deterministic prediction: that is when tlJ, instead of  being a superposition of eigenfunctions, is reduced to a single  one. In particular, in an ideal measurement process, a system  may be prepared in such a way that the result of a given mea­ surement may be predicted. We then know that the system is  described by the corresponding eigenfunction. From then on,  the system may be described with certainty as being in the  eigenstate indicated by the measurement result. </p><div id="pagenum"><p>260</p></div><p id="page">ORDER OUT OF CHAOS 228  The measurement process in quantum mechanics has a spe·  cial significance that is attracting considerable interest today.  Suppose we start with a wave function, which is indeed a su­ perposition of eigenfunctions. As a result of the measurement  process, this single collection of systems all represented by  the same wave function is replaced by a collection of wave  functions corresponding to the various eigenvalues that may  be measured. Stated technically , a measurement leads from a  single wave function (a "pure" state) to a mixture.  As Bohr and Rosenfeld IO repeatedly pointed out, every  measurement contains an element of irreversibility, an appeal  made to irreversible phenomena, such as chemical processes  corresponding to the recording of the "data." Recording is ac­ companied by an amplifica tion whereby a microscopic event  produces an effect on a macroscopic level-that is, a level at  which we can read the measuring instruments. The measure­ ment thus presupposes irreversibility.  This was in a sense already true in classical physics. How·  ever, the problem of the irreversible character of measurement  is more urgent in quantum mechanics because it raises ques­ tions at the level of its formulation.  The usual approach to this problem states that quantum me­ chanics has no choice but to postulate the coexistence of two  mutually irreducible processes. the reversible and continuous  evolution described by Schrodinger's equation and the irre­ versible and discontinuous reduction of the wave function to  one of its eigenfunctions at the time of measur ement. Thus the  paradox: the reversible Schrodinger equation can be tested  only by irreversible measurements that the equation is by defi­ nition unable to describe. It is thus impossible for quantum  mechanics to set up a closed structure.  In the face of these difficulties, some physicists have once  more taken refuge in subjectivism, stating that we-our mea­ surement and even, for some, our mind-determine the evolu­ tion of the system that breaks the law of natural, "objective"  reversibility.11 Others have concluded that Schrodinger's equa­ tion was not "complete" and that new terms must be added to  account for the irreversibility of the measureme nt. Other more  improbable "solutions" have also been proposed, such as  Everett's many-world hypothesis (see d'Espagnat, ref. 8). For  us, however, the coexistence in quantum mechanics of revers-</p><div id="pagenum"><p>261</p></div><p id="page">229 REDISCOVERING TIME  ibility and irreversibility shows that the classical idealization  that describes the dynamic world as self-contained is impossi­ ble at the microscopic level. This is what Bohr meant when he  noted that the language we use to describe a quantum system  cannot be separated from the macroscopic concepts that de­ scribe the functioning of our measurement instruments. Schro­ dinger's equation does not describe a separate level of reality;  rather it presupposes the macroscopic world to which we be- long. ·  The problem of measurement in quantum mechanics is thus  an aspect of one of the problems to which this book is de­ voted-the connection between the simple world described by  Hamiltonian trajectories and Schrodinger's equation, and the  complex macroscopic world of irreversible processes.  In Chapter IX, we shall see that irreversibility enters classi­ cal physics when the idealization involved in the concept of a  trajectory becomes inadequate. The measurement problem in  quantum mechanics is susceptible to the same type of solu­ tion.12 Indeed, the wave function represents the maximum  knowledge of a quantum system. As in classical physics, the  object of this maximum knowledge satisfies a reversible evolu­ tion equation. In both cases, irreversibility enters when the  ideal object corresponding to maximum knowledge has to be  replaced by less idealized concepts. But when does this hap­ pen? This is the question of the physical mechanisms of irre­ versibility to which we shall turn in Chapter IX. But let us first  summarize some other features of the renewal of contempo­ rary science.  A Nonequilibrium Universe  The two scientific revolutions described in this chapter started  as attempts to incorporate universal constants, c and h, into  the framework of classical mechanics. This led to far-reaching  consequence s, some of which we have described here. From  other perspectives, relativity and quantum mechanics seemed  to adhere to the basic world view expressed in Newtonian me­ chanics. This is especially true regarding the role and meaning  of time. In quantum mechanics, once the wave function at time </p><div id="pagenum"><p>262</p></div><p id="page">ORDER OUT OF CHAOS 230  zero is known, its value ljJ(t) both for future and past is deter·  mined. Likewise, in relativity theory the static geometric charac·  ter of time is often emphasized by the use of four-dimensional  notation (three dimensions for space and one for time). As ex­ pressed concisely by Minkowski in 1908, "space by itself and  time by itself are doomed to fade away into mere shadows, and  only a kind of union of the two will preserve an independent  reality ... only a world in itself will subsist." 13  But over the past five decades this situation has radically  changed. Quantum mechanics has become the main tool for  dealing with elementary particles and their transformations. It  is outside the scope of this book to describe the bewildering  variety of elementary particles that have appeared during the  past few years.  We want only to recall that, using both quantum mechanics  and relativity, Dirac demonstrated that we have to associate to  each particle of mass m and charge e an antiparticle of the  same mass but of opposite charge. Positrons, the antiparticles  of electrons, as well as antiprotons, are currently being pro­ duced in high-ener gy accelerators. Antimatter has become a  common subject of study in particle physics. Particles and  their corresponding antiparticles annihilate each other when they  collide, producing photons, massless particles corresponding  to light. The equations of quantum theory are symmetric in  respect to the exchange particle-antipar ticle, or more pre­ cisely, they are symmetric in respect to a weaker requirement  known as the CPT symmetr y. In spite of this symmetry, there  exists a remarkable dissymmetry between particles and anti­ particles in the world around us. We are made of particles  (electrons, protons), while antiparti cles remain rare laboratory  products. If particles and antiparticles coexisted in equal  amount, all matter would be annihilat ed. There is strong evi­ dence that antimatter does not exist in our galaxy, but the pos­ sibility that it exists in distant galaxies cannot be excluded. We  can imagine a mechanism in the universe that separates parti­ cles and antiparticles, hides antiparticles somewher e. How­ ever, it seems more likely that we live in a "nonsymmetrical"  universe where matter completely dominates antimatter .  How is this possible? A model explaining the situation was  presented by Sakharov in 1966, and today much work is being  done along these lines.14 One essential element of the model is </p><div id="pagenum"><p>263</p></div><p id="page">231 REDISCOVERING TIME  that, at the time of the formation of matter, the universe had to  be in n{)nequilibrium conditions, for at equilibrium the law of  mass action discussed in Chapter V would have required equal  amounts of matter and antimatter .  What we want to emphasize here is that nonequilibrium has  now acquired a new, cosmological dimension. Without non­ equilibrium and without the irreversible processes linked to it,  the universe would have a completely different structure.  There would be no appreciable amount of matter, only some  fluctuating local excesses of matter over antimatter, or vice  versa.  From a mechanistic theory that was modified to account for  the existence of the universal constant h, quantum theory has  evolved into a theory of mutual transformations of elementary  particles. In recent attempts to formulate a "unified theory of  elementary particles" it has even been suggested that all parti­ cles of matter, including the proton, are unstable (however, the  lifetime of the proton would be enormou s, of the order of 1 Q30  years). Mechanics, the science of motion, instead of corre­ sponding to the fundamental level of description, becomes a  mere approximation, useful only because of the long lifetime  of elementary particles such as protons.  Relativity theory has gone through the same transforma­ tions. As we mentioned, it started as a geometric theory that  strongly emphasized timeless features. Today it is the main  tool for investigating the thermal history of the universe, for  providing clues to the mechani sms that led to the present  structure of the universe. The problem of time, of irreversibil­ ity, has therefore acquired a new urgency. From the field of  engineering, of applied chemistry, where it was first formu­ lated, it has spread to the whole of physics, from elementary  particles to cosmology.  From the perspective of this book, the importance of quan­ tum mechanics lies in its introduction of probability into micro­ scopic physics. This should not be confused with the stochastic  processes that describe chemical reactions as discussed in  Chapter V. In quantum mechanics, the wave function evolves  in a deterministic fashion, except in the measurement process.  We have seen that in the fifty years since the formulation of  quantum mechanics the study of nonequilibrium processes  has revealed that fluctuation s, stochastic elements, are impor-</p><div id="pagenum"><p>264</p></div><p id="page">ORDER OUT OF CHAOS 232  tant even on the microscopic scale. We have repeatedly stated  in this book that the reconceptualization of physics going on  today leads from deterministic, reversible processes to stochas­ tic and irreversible ones. We believe that quantum mechanics  occupies a kind of intermedi ate position in this process. There  probability appears, but not irreversibility. We expect, and we  shall give some reasons for this in Chapter IX, that the next  step will be the introduction of fundamental irreversibility on  the microscopic level. In contrast with the attempts to restore  classical orthodoxy through hidden variables or other means,  we shall argue that it is necessary to move even farther away  from deterministic descriptions of nature and adopt a statisti­ cal, stochastic description. </p><div id="pagenum"><p>265</p></div><p id="page">CHAPTER VIII  THE CLASH OF  DOCTRINES  Probability and Irreversibility  We shall see that nearly everywhere the physicist has  purged from his science the use of one-way time, as  though aware that this idea introduces an antrlropo­ morphlc element alien to the ideals of physics. Never­ theless, in several important cases unidirectional time  and unidirectional causality have been invoked, but al­ ways, as we shall proceed to show. in support of some  false doctrine.  G. N.LEWIS'  The law that entropy always increases-the second  law of thermodynamics-holds, I think, the supreme  position among the laws of Nature. If someone points  out to you that your pet theory of the universe is in  disagreement with Maxwell's equations -then so  much the worse for Maxwells equations. If it is found to  be contradicted by observatio n-well, these expe­ rimental ists do bungle things sometimes. But if your  theory is found to be against the second law of ther­ modynamics I can give you no hope; there is nothing  for it but to collapse in deepest humiliation.  A S. EDDINGTON2  With Clausius' formulation of the second law of thermodynam·  ics, the conflict between thermodynamics and dynamics be·  came obvious. There is hardly a single question in physi�s that  has been more often and more actively discussed than the rela·  233 </p><div id="pagenum"><p>266</p></div><p id="page">ORDER OUT OF CHAOS 234  tion between thermodynamics and dynamics. Even now, a  hundred and fifty years after Clausius, the question still  arouses strong feelings. No one can remain neutral in this con­ flict, which involves the meaning of reality and time. Must  dynamic s, the mother of modern science, be abandoned in  favor of some form of thermodynamics? That was the view of  the "energeticists," who exerted great influence during the  nineteenth century. Is there a way to "save" dynamics, tore­ coup the second law without giving up the formidable struc­ ture built by Newton and his successors? What role can  entropy play in a world described by dynamics?  We have already mentioned the answer proposed by Boltz­ mann. Boltzmann's famous equation S = k log P relates en­ tropy and probability: entropy grows because probability grows.  Let us immediately emphasize that in this perspective the sec­ ond law would have great practical importance but would be of  no fundamental significance. In his excellent book The Ambi­ dextrous Universe, Martin Gardner writes: "Certain events go  only one way not because they can't go the other way but be­ cause it is extremely unlikely that they go backward . "3 By im­ proving our abilities to measure less and less unlikely events,  we could reach a situation in which the second law would play  as small a role as we want. This is the point of view that is  often taken today. However , this was not Planck's point of  view:  It would be absurd to assume that the validity of the sec­ ond law depends in any way on the skill of the physicist  or chemist in observing or experimenting. The gist of the  second law has nothing to do with experiment; the law  asserts briefly that there exists in nature a quantity which  changes always in the same sense in all natural pro­ cesses. The proposition stated in this general form may  be correct or incorrect; but whichever it may be, it will  remain so, irrespective of whether thinking and measur­ ing beings exist on the earth or not, and whether or not,  assuming they do exist, they are able to measure the de­ tails of physical or chemical processes more accurately  by one, two, or a hundred decimal places than we can.  The limitation to the law, if any, must lie in the same  province as its essential idea, in the observed Nature, and </p><div id="pagenum"><p>267</p></div><p id="page">235 THE CLASH OF DOCTRINES  not in the Observer . That man's experience is called upon  in the deduction of the law is of no consequence ; for that  is, in fact, our only way of arriving at a knowledge of  natural law. 4  However, Planck's views remained isolated. As we noted,  most scientists consider ed the second law the result of approx­ imations, the intrusion of subjective views into the exact world  of physics. For example, in a celebrated sentence Born stated,  "Irreversibility is the effect of the introduction of ignorance  into the basic laws of physics. "5  In the present chapter we wish to describe some of the basic  steps in the development of the interpretation of the second  law. We must first understand why this problem appeared to  be so difficult. In Chapter IX we shall go on to present a new  approach that, we hope, will clearly express both the radical  originality and the objective meaning of the second law. Our  conclusion will agree with Planck's view. We shall show that,  far from destroying the formidable structure of dynamics, the  second law adds an essential new element to it.  First we wish to clarify Boltzmann's association of proba­ bility and entropy. We shall begin by describing the "urn  model" proposed by P. and T. Ehrenfest. 6 Consider N objects  (for example, balls) distributed between two containers A and  B. At regular time intervals (for example, every second) a ball  tioen D EJ  A B !-tottery  N-k+1 time n+1 1 or N-k-1  A B  Figure 23. Ehrenf est's urn model. N balls are distributed between two con­ tainers A and B. At time n there are k balls in A and N- k balls in B. At regular  time intervals a ball is taken at random from A and put in B. </p><div id="pagenum"><p>268</p></div><p id="page">ORDER OUT OF CHAOS 236  is chosen at random and moved from one container to the  other. Suppose that at time n there are k balls in A and N-k  balls in B. Then at time n + I there can be in A either k-I or  k+ I balls. We have the transition probabilities kiN for k-+k- 1  and 1-k/N for k-+k+ 1. Suppose we continue the game. We  expect that as a result of the exchanges of balls the most proba­ ble distribution in Boltzmann's sense will be reached. When the  number N of balls is large, this distribution corresponds to an  equal number N/2 of balls in each urn. This can be verified by  elementary calculations or by performing the experiment.  N k--2  t  Figure 24. Approach to equilibrium (k= Nt2) in Ehrenfest's urn model  (schematic representation).  The Ehrenfest model is a simple example of a "Markov pro­ cess" (or Markov "chain"), named after the great Russian  mathematician Markov, who was one of the first to describe  such processes (Poincare was another). In brief, their charac­ teristic feature is the existence of well-defined transition prob­ abilities independent of the previous history of the system.  Markov chains have a remarkab le property: they can be de­ scribed in terms of entropy. Let us call P(k) the probability of  finding k balls in A. We may then associate to it an "J-{ quan­ tity," which has the precise properties of entropy that we dis­ cussed in Chapter IV. Figure 25 gives an example of its  evolution. The Jf quantity varies uniformly with time, as does  the entropy of an isolated system. It is true that J-{ decreases  with time, while the entropy S increases, but that is a matter of  definition: J-{ plays the role of -s. · </p><div id="pagenum"><p>269</p></div><p id="page">237 THE CLASH OF DOCTRINES  t  Figure 25. Time evolution of the J{ quantity (defined in the text) corre­ sponding to the Ehrenfest model. This quantity decreases monotonously  and vanishes for long times.  The mathematical meaning of this "J-l quantity" is worth  considering in more detail: it measures the difference between  the probabilities at a given time and those that exist at the  equilibrium state (where the number of balls in each urn is  N/2). The argument used in the Ehrenfest urn model can be  generalized. Let us consider the partition of a square-that is,  we subdivide the square into a number of disjointed regions  (see Figure 26). Then we consider the distribution of particles  in the square and call P(k,t) the probability of finding a particle  in the region k. Similarly, we call Peqm(k) this quantity when  uniformity is reached. We assume that, as in the urn model,  there exist well-defined transition probabilities. The definition  of the J-l. quantity is  J{ = � P(k,t) log J<k'(k)  k eqm  Note the ratio P(k,t)IPeqm(k) that appears in this formula. Sup­ pose there arc eight boxes and that Peqm(k) = 1/8. For example,  we may start with all the particles in the first box. The corre-</p><div id="pagenum"><p>270</p></div><p id="page">ORDER OUT OF CHAOS 238  sponding values of P(k,t) would be P(l ,t) = 1, all others zero. As  the result we find .Jl= log (II[ 1/8]) =log 8. As time goes by, the  particles become equally distributed and P(k,t) = Peqm(k) = 1/8.  As the result the :I{ quantity vanishes. It can be shown that, in  accordance with Figure 25, the decrease in the value of :H pro­ ceeds in a uniform fashion. (The demonstr ation is given in all  textbooks dealing with the theory of stochastic processes.)  This is why :H plays the role of -S, entropy. The uniform de­ crease of .H has a very simple meaning: it measures the pro­ gressive uniformization of the system. The initial information  is lost, and the system evolves from "order" to "disorder."  Note that a Markov process implies fluctuations, as clearly  indicated in Figure 24. If we would wait long enough we would  recover the initial state. However, we are dealing with aver­ ages. The :JiM quantity that decreases uniformly is expressed  in terms of probability distributions and not in terms of indi­ vidual events. It is the probability distribution that evolves ir­ reversibly (in the Ehrenfest model, the distribution function  tends uniformly to a binomial distribution). Therefore, on the  level of distribution functions, Markov chains lead to a one­ wayn�ss in time.  This arrow of time marks the difference between Markov  chains and temporal evolution in quantum mechanics, where  the wave function, though related to probabilities, evolves re­ versibly. It also illustrates the close relation between stochas­ tic processes, such as Markov chains, and irreversibility.  However, the increasing of entropy (or decreasing of Jf) is not  based on an arrow of time present in the laws of nature but on  our decision to use present knowledge to predict future (and  not past) behavior. Gibbs states it in his usual lapidary man­ ner:  But while the distinction of prior and subsequent events  may be immaterial with respect to mathematical fictions,  it is quite otherwise with respect to the events of the real  world. It should not be forgotten, when our ensembles  are chosen to illustrate the probabilities of events in the  real world, that while the probabilities of subsequent  events may often be determined from the probabilities of  prior events, it is rarely the case that probabilities of prior </p><div id="pagenum"><p>271</p></div><p id="page">239 THE CLASH OF DOCTRINES  events can be determin ed from those of subsequent  events, for we are rarely justified in excluding the consid­ eration of the antecedent probability of the prior events. 7  It is an important point, which has led to a great deal of discus­ sion. 8 Probability calculus is indeed time-oriented. The pre­ diction of the future is different from retrodiction. If this was  the whole story, we would have to conclude that we are forced  to accept a subjective interpretation of irreversibility , since the  distinction between future and past would depend only on us.  In other words, in the subjective interpretation of iri;"eversibil­ ity (further reinforced by the ambiguous analogy with infor­ mation theory), the observer is responsible for the temporal  asymmetry characterizing the system's developme nt. Since  the observer cannot in a single glance determine the positions  and velocities of all the particles composing a complex sys­ tem, he cannot know the instantaneo us state that simul­ taneously contains its past and its future, nor can he grasp the  reversible law that would allow him to predict its developments  from one moment to the next. Neither can he manipulate the  system like the demon invented by Maxwell, who can separate  fast-and slow-moving particles and impose on a system an  antithermodynamic evolution toward an increasingly less uni­ form temperature distribution.9  Thermodynamics remains the science of complex systems;  but, from this perspective, the only specific feature of complex  systems is that our knowledge of them is limited and that our  uncertainty increases with time. Instead of recognizing in irre­ versiblity something that links nature to the observer, the sci­ entist is compelled to admit that nature merely mirrors his  ignorance. Nature is silent; irreversibility, far from rooting us  in the physical world, is merely the echo of human endeavor  and of its limits.  However , one immediate objection can be raised. According  to such interpretations, thermodynamics ought to be as uni­ versal as our ignorance. There should exist only irreversible  processes. This is the stumbling block for all universal inter ­ pretations of entropy that concentr ate on our ignorance of ini­ tial (or boundary) condition s. Irreversibility is not a universal  propercy. In order to link dynamics and thermodynam ics, a </p><div id="pagenum"><p>272</p></div><p id="page">ORDER OUT OF CHAOS 240  physical criterion is required to distinguish between reversible  and irreversible processes.  We shall take up this question in Chapter IX. Here let us  return to the history of science and Boltzmann's pioneering  work.  Boltzn1a nns Breakthrough  Boltzmann's fundamental contribution dates from 1872, about  thirty years before the discovery of Markov chains. His ambi­ tion was to derive a "mechanical" inte rpretation of entropy. In  other words, while in Markov chains the transition probabili­ ties are given from outside as, for example, in the Ehrenfest  model, we now have to relate them to the dynamic behavior of  the system. Boltzmann was so fascinated by this problem that  he devoted most of his scientific life to it. In his Populiire  Schriften10 he wrote: "If someone asked me what name we  should give to this century, I would answer without hesitation  that this is the century of Darwin." Boltzmann was deeply at­ tracted by the idea of evolution, and his ambition was to be­ come the "Darwin" of the evolution of matter.  The first step toward the mechanistic interpretation of en­ tropy was to reintroduce the concept of "collisions" of mole­ cules or atoms into the physical descripti on, and along with it  the possibility of a statistical description . This step had been  taken by Clausius and Maxwell. Since collisions are discrete  events, we may count them and estimate their average fre­ quency. We may also classify collision s-for example, dis­ tinguish between collisions producing a particle with a given  velocity v and collisions dest roying a particle with a velocity v,  producing molecules with a different velocity (the "direct"  and "inverse" collisions) ; ll  The question Maxwell asked was whether it was possible to  define a state of a gas such that the collisions that incessantly  modify the velocities of the molecules no longer determine  any evolution in the distribution of these velocitie s-that is, in  the mean number of particles for each velocity value. What is  the velocity distribution such that the effects of the different  collisions compensa te each other on the population scale? </p><div id="pagenum"><p>273</p></div><p id="page">241 THE CLASH OF DOCTR INES  Maxwell demonstr ated that this particular state, which is  the thermodynamic equilibrium state, occurs when the veloc­ ity distribution becomes the well-known "bell-shaped curve,"  the "gaussian," which Quetelet, the founder of "social phys­ ics," had consider ed to be the very expression of randomn ess.  Maxwell's theory permits us to give a simple interpretation of  some of the basic laws describing the behavior of gases. An  increase in temperature corresponds to an increase in the  mean velocity of the molecules and thus of the energy associ­ ated with their motion. Experiments have verified Maxwell's  law with great accuracy, and it still provides a basis for the  solution of numerous problems in physical chemistry (for ex­ ample, the calculation of the number of collisions in a reactive  mixture).  Boltzmann, however, wanted to go farther. He wanted to  describe not only the state of equilibrium but also evolution  toward equilibrium -that is, evolution toward the Maxwellian  distributi on. He wanted to discover the molecular mechanism  that corresponds to the increase of entropy, the mechanism  that drives a system from an arbitrary distribution of velocities  toward equilibrium.  Characteristically , Boltzmann approached the question of  physical evolution not at the level of individual trajectories but  at the level of a population of molecules. This, Boltzmann felt,  was virtually tantamount to accomplishing Darwin's feat, but  this time in physics: the driving force behind biological evolu­ tion-natural selection-cannot be defined for one individual  but only for a large population. It is therefore a statistical con­ cept.  Boltzmann's result may be described in relatively simple  terms. The evolution of the distribution function f ( v, t) of the  velocities v in some region of space and at time t appears as  the sum of two effects; the number of particles at any given  time t having a velocity v varies both as the result of the free  motion of the particles and as the result of collisions between  particles. The first result can be easily calculated in the terms  of classical dynamics. It is in the investigation of the second  result, due to collision s, that the originality of Boltzmann's  method lies. In the face of the difficulties involved in following  the trajectories (including the interactions), Boltzmann came  to use concepts similar to those outlined in Chapter V (in con-</p><div id="pagenum"><p>274</p></div><p id="page">ORDER OUT OF CHAOS 242  nection with chemical reactions) and to calculate the average  number of collisions creating or destroying a molecule corre­ sponding to a velocity v.  Here once again there are two processes with opposite  effects-"direct" collisions, those producing a molecule with  velocity v starting from two molecules with velocities v' and  v", and "inverse" collisions, in which a molecule with velocity  v is destroyed by collision with a molecule with velocity v"'.  As with chemical reactions (see Chapter V, section 1), the fre­ quency of such events is evaluated as being proportional to the  product of the number of molecules taking part in these pro­ cesses. (Of course, historically speaking, Boltzmann's method  [1872] preceded that of chemical kinetics.)  The results obtained by Boltzmann are quite similar to those  obtained in Markov chains. Again we shall introduce an J{  quantity, this time referring to the velocity distribution f. It  may be written J{= f flog f dv. Once again, this quantity can  only decrease in time until equilibrium is reached and the ve­ locity distribution becomes the equilibrium Maxwellian dis­ tribution.  In recent years there have been numerous numerical ver­ ifications of the uniform decrease of J{ with time. All of them  confirm Boltzmann's pred iction. Even today, his kinetic equa­ tion plays an important role in the physics of gases: transport  coefficients such as those characterizing heat conductivity or  diffusion can be calculated in good agreement with experimen­ tal data.  However, it is from the conceptual standpoint that Boltz­ mann's achievement is greatest: the distinction between re­ versible and irreversible phenomena, which, as we have seen,  underlies the second law, is now transposed onto the micro­ scopic level. The change of the velocity distribution due to  free motion corresponds to the reversible part, while the con­ tribution due to collisions corresponds to the irreversible part.  For Boltzmann this was the key to the microscopic interpreta­ tion of entropy. A principle of molecular evolution had been  produced! It is easy to understand the fascination this discov­ ery exerted on the physicists who followed Boltzmann , includ­ ing Planck, Einstein, and Schrodinger.t2  Boltzmann's breakthrough was a decisive step in the direc-</p><div id="pagenum"><p>275</p></div><p id="page">243 THE CLASH OF DOCTR INES  tion of the physics of processes. What determines temporal  evolution in Boltzmann's equation is no longer the Hamilto­ nian, depending on the type of forces; now, on the contrary,  functions associated with the processes- for example, the  cross section of scattering-will generate motion. Can we con­ clude that the problem of irreversibility has been solved, that  Boltzmann's theory has reduced entropy to dynamics? The  answer is clear: No, it has not. Let us have a closer look at this  question.  Question ing Boltzmanns Interpretation  As soon as Boltzmann's fundamental paper appeared in 1872,  objections were raised. Had Boltzmann really "deduced" irre­ versibility from dynamic s? How could the reversible laws of  trajectories lead to irreversible evolution? Is Boltzmann's ki­ netic equation in any way compatible with dynamic s? It is  easy to see that the symmetry present in Boltzmann's equa­ tion is in contradiction with the symmetry of classical me­ chanics.  We have already seen that velocity inversion (v�-v) pro­ duces in classical dynamics the same effect as time inversion  (t�-t). This is a basic symmetry of classical dynamics, and  we would expect that Boltzmann's kinetic equation , which de­ scribes the time change of the distribution function, would  share this symmetry. But this is not so. The collision term  calculated by Boltzmann remains invariant with respect to ve­ locity inversion. There is a simple physical reason for this.  Nothing in Boltzmann's picture distinguishes a collision that  proceeds toward the future from a collision proceeding toward  the past. This is the basis of Poincare's objection to Boltz­ mann's derivation. A correct calculation can never lead to  conclusions that contradict its premises.B· 14 As we have seen,  the symmetry properties of the kinetic equation obtained by  Boltzmann for the distribution function contradict those of dy­ namics. Boltzmann cannot, therefore, have "deduced" en­ tropy from dynamics. He must have introduced something  new, something foreign to dynam ics. Thus his results �;an rep-</p><div id="pagenum"><p>276</p></div><p id="page">ORDER OUT OF CHAOS 244  resent at best only a phenome nological model that, however  useful, has no direct relation with dynamic s. This was also the  objection that Zermelo (1896) brought against Boltzmann.  Loschmidt's objection, on the other hand, makes it possible  to determine the limits of validity of Boltzmann's kinetic  model. In fact, Loschmidt observed (1876) that this model can  no longer be valid after a reversal of the velocities correspond­ ing to the transformation v-+-v.  Let us explain this by means of a thought experiment . We  start with a gas in a nonequilibrium condition and let it evolve  till t0• We then invert the velocitie s. The system reverts to its  past state. As a conseque nce, Boltzmann's entropy is the  same at t=O and at t=2t0•  We may multiply such thought experime nts. Start with a  mixture of hydrogen and oxygen; after some time water will  appear. If we invert the velocitie s, we should go back to an  initial state with hydrogen and oxygen and no water.  It is interesting that in laboratory or computer experiments,  we actually can perform a velocity inversion. For example, in  Figures 26 and 27, Boltzmann's J{ quantity has been calcu­ lated for two-dimensional hard spheres (hard disks), starting  first collision  ae  •  •  0 20 40 TIME 60  Figure 26.

The results follow Boltzmann's predictions.  If, after fifty or a hundred collisions, corresponding to about  I0-6 sec in a dilute gas, the velocities are inverted, a new en­ semble is obtained.15 Now, after the velocity inversion, Boltz­ mann's J{ quantity increases instead of decreasing.

A similar situation can be produced in spin echo experi­ ments or plasma echo experiments. There also, over limited  periods of time, an "antithermodynamic" behavior in Boltz­ mann's sense may be observed.  But it is important to note that the velocity inversion experi­ ment becomes increasingly more difficult when the time inter­ val t0 after which the inversion occurs is increased.  To be able to retrace its past, the gas must remember every­ thing that happened to it during the time interval from 0 to t0•  There must be "storage" of information. We can express this  storage in terms of correlations between particles. We shall  come back to the question of correlations in Chapter IX. Let  us only mention here that it is precisely this relation between  correlations and collisions that is the element missing from </p><div id="pagenum"><p>278</p></div><p id="page">ORDER OUT OF CHAOS 246  Boltzmann's consider ations. When Loschmidt confronted him  with this, Boltzmann had to accept that there was no way out:  the collisions occurring in the opposite direction "undo" what  was done previously, and the system has to revert to its initial  state. Therefore, the function J{ must also increase until it  again reaches its initial value. Velocity inversion thus calls for  a distinction between the situations to which Boltzmann's rea­ soning applies and those to which it does not.  Once the problem was stated (1894), it was easy to identify  the nature of this limitation.l6, 17 The validity of Boltzmann's  statistical procedure depends on the assumption that before  they collide, the molecules behave independently of one an­ other. This constitutes an assumption about the initial condi­ tions, called the "molecular chaos" assumption. The initial  conditions created by a velocity inversion do not conform to  this assumption. If the system is made "to go backward in  time," a new "anomalous" situation is created in the sense  that certain molecules are then "destined" to meet at a pre­ determinable instant and to undergo a predetermined change  of velocity at this time, however far apart they may be at the  instant of velocity inversion.  · Velocity inversion thus creates a highly organized system,  and thus the molecular chaos assumption fails. The various  collisions produce, as if by a preestablished harmony, an ap­ parently purposeful behavior.  But there is more. What does the transition from order to  disorder signify? In the Ehrenfest urn experiment, it is clear­ the system will evolve till uniformity is reached. But other sit­ uations are not so clear; we may do computer experiments in  which interacting particles are initially distributed at random.  In time a lattice is formed. Do we still move from order to  disorder? The answer is not obvious. To understand order and  disorder we first have to define the objects in terms of which  these concepts are used. Moving from dynamic to thermody­ namic objects is easy in the case of dilute gases-as shown by  the work of Boltzmann. However , it is not so easy in the case  of dense systems whose molecules interact.  Because of such difficulties, Boltzmann's creative and pi­ oneering work remained incomplete. </p><div id="pagenum"><p>279</p></div><p id="page">247 THE CLASH OF DOCTRINES  Dynarnics and Thermodynam ics:  Two Separate Worlds  We already noted that trajectories are incompatible with the  idea of irreversibility. However, the study of trajectories is not  the only way in which we can give a formulation of dynamics.  There is also the theory of ensembles introduced by Gibbs and  Einstein, 6. 18 which is of special interest in the case of systems  formed by a large number of molecules. The essential new  element in the Gibbs-Einstein ensemble theory is that we can  formulate the dynamic theory independently of any precise  specification of initial condition s.  The theory of ensembles represents dynamic systems in  "phase space." The dynamic state of a point particle is spec­ ified by position (a vector with three components) and by mo­ mentum (also a vector with three comp onents). We may  represent this state by two points, each in a three-dimensional  space, or by a single point in the six-dimensio nal space formed  by the coordinates and momenta. This is the phase space.  This geometric representation can be extended to an arbitrary  system formed by n particles. We then need n x 6 numbers to  specify the state of the system, or alternatively we may spec ify  this system by a single point in the 6n-dimensional phase  space. The evolution in time of such a system will then be  described by a trajectory in the phase space.  It has already been stated that the exact initial conditions of  a macroscopic system are never known. Nevertheless, nothing  prevents us from representing this system by an "ensemble"  of points-namely , the points corresponding to the various dy­ namic states �ompatible with the information we have con­ cerning the system. Each region of phase space may contain an  infinite number of representative points, the density of which  measures the probability of actually finding the system in this  region. Instead of introducing an infinity of discrete points, it  is more convenient to introduce a continuous density of repre­ sentative points in the phase space. We shall call p (q1 ••• q30,  p1 ••• p30) this density in phase space where q1 ,q2 ••• q3n are  the coordinates of then points; similarly, p1 ,p2 ••• p30 are the  momenta (each point has three coordinates and three mo-</p><div id="pagenum"><p>280</p></div><p id="page">ORDER OUT OF CHAOS 248  menta) . This density measures the probability of finding a dy­ namic system around the point ql ... q3n,PI ••• P3n in phase  space.  Presented in such a way, the density function p may appear  as an idealizat ion, an artificial construct, whereas the trajec­ tory of a point in phase space would correspond "directly" to  the description of "natural" behavior. But in fact it is the  point, not the density , that corresponds to an idealization. In­ deed, we never know an initial state with the infinite degree of  precision that would reduce a region in phase space to a single  point; we can only determine an ensemble of trajectories start­ ing from the ensemble of representa tive points corresponding  to what we know about the initial state of the system. The  density function p represents knowledge about a system, and  the more accurate this knowledge, the smaller the region in the  phase space where the density function is different from zero  and where the system may be found. Should the density func­ tion everywhere have a uniform value, we would know nothing  about the state ofthe system. It might be in any of the possible  states compatible with its dynamic structure.  From this perspective, a point thus represents the maximum  knowledge we can have about a system. It is the result of a  limiting process, the result of the ever-growing precision of our  knowledge. As we shall see in Chapter IX, a fundamental  problem will be to determine when such a limiting process is  really possible. Through increased precision, this process  means we go from a region where the density function p is  different from zero to another, smaller region inside the first.  We can continue this until the region containing the system  becomes arbitrarily small. But as we shall see, we must be  cautious: arbitrarily small does not mean zero, and it is not  certain a priori that this limiting process will lead to the pos­ sibility of consistently predicting a single well-defined trajec­ tory.  The introduction of the theory of ensembles by Gibbs and  Einstein was a natural continuation of Boltzmann's work. In  this perspective the density function p in phase space replaces  the velocity distribution function f used by Boltzmann. How­ ever, the physical content of p exceeds that off. Just like/, the  density function p determines the velocity distribution, but it  also contains other information, such as the probability of </p><div id="pagenum"><p>281</p></div><p id="page">2�9 THE CLASH OF DOCTRINES  meeting two particles a certain distance apart. In particular,  correlations between particles, which we discussed in the pre­ ceding section, are now included in the density function p. In  fact, this function contains the complete information about all  statistical features of the n-b9dy system.  We must now describe the evolution of the density function  in phase space. At first sight, this appears to be an even more  ambitious task than the one Boltzmann set himself for the ve­ locity distribution function. But this is not the case. The Ham­ iltonian equations discussed in Chapter 11 allow us to obtain  an exact evolution equation for p without any further approx­ imations. This is the so-called Liouville equation, to which we  shall return in Chapter IX. Here we wish merely to point out  , that the properties of Hamiltonian dynamics imply that the  evolution of the density function p in phase space is that of an  incompressible fluid. Once the representative points occupy a  region of volume V in phase space, this volume remains con­ stant in time. The shape of the region may be deformed in an  arbitrary way, but the value of the volume remains the same.  Gibbs' theory of ensembles thus permits a rigorous combi­ nation of the statistical point of view (the study of the "popula­ tion" described by p) and the laws of dynamics . It also permits  a more accurate representation of the thermodynamic equilib­ rium state. Thus, in the case of an isolated system, the ensem- p  q  Figure 28. Time evolution in the phase space of a "volume" containing the  representative points of a system: the volume is conserved while the shape  is modified.

The density p will differ from zero only on  the "microcanonical surface" corresponding to the specified  value of the energy in phase space. Initially, the density p may  be distributed arbitrarily over this surface. At equilibrium, p  must no longer vary with time and has to be independent of  the specific initial state. Thus the approach to equilibrium has  a simple meaning in terms of the evolution of p. The distribu­ tion function p becomes uniform over the microcanonical sur­ face. Each ci the points on this surface has the same probability  of actually representing the system. This corresponds to the  "microcanonical ensemble ."  Does the theory of ensembles bring us any closer to the  solution of the problem of irreversibility? Boltzmann's theory  describes thermodynamic entr opy in terms of the velocity dis­ tribution function f. He achieved this result through the intro­ duction of his J{ quantity. As we have seen, the system evolves  in time until the Maxwellian distribution is reached, while,  during this evolution, the quantity J-{ decreases uniformly. Can  we now, in a more general fashion, take the evolution of the  distribution p in phase space toward the microcanonical en­ semble as the basis for entropy increase? Would it be enough  to replace Boltzmann's quantity J{ expressed in terms ofjby a  "Gibbsian" quantity 3£0 defined in exactly the same way, but  this time in terms of p? Unfortunately , the answer to both  questions is "No." If we use the Liouville equation, which  describes the evolution of the density phase space P. and take  into account the conservation of volume in phase space we  have mentioned, the conclusion is immediate: :Jf0 is a con­ stant and thus cannot represent entropy. With respect to Boltz­ mann, this appears as a step backward rather than forward!  Though it is negative, Gibbs' conclusion remains very im­ portant. We have already discussed the ambiguity of the ideas  of order and disorder. What the constancy of 3£0 tells us is  that there is no change of order whatsoever in the frame of  dynamic theory! The "information" expressed by 3£0 remains  constant. This can be understood as follows: we have seen that  collisions introduce correlations. From the perspective of ve­ locities, the result of collisions is randomiza tion; therefore we  can describe this process as a transition from order to disor-</p><div id="pagenum"><p>283</p></div><p id="page">251 THE CLASH OF DOCTRINES  der, but the appearance of correlations as the result of collision  points in the opposite direction, toward a transition from dis­ order to order! Gibbs' result shows that the two effects exactly  cancel each other.  We come, therefore, to an important conclusion. Whatever  representation we use, be it the idea of trajectories or the  Gibbs-Einstein ensemble theory, we will never be able to de­ duce a theory of irreversible processes that will be valid for  every system that satisfies the laws of classical (or quantum)  dynamics. There isn't even a way to speak of a transition from  order to disorder! How should we understand these negative re­ sults? Is any theory of irreversible processes in absolute con­ flict with dynamics (classical or quantum)? It has often been  proposed that we include some cosmological terms that would  express the influence of the expanding universe on the equa­ tions of motion. Cosmological terms would ultimately provide  the arrow of time. Howeve r, this is difficult to accept. On the  one hand, it is not clear how we should add these cosmolo gical  terms; on the other , precise dynamic experiments seem to rule  out the existence of such terms, at least on the terrestrial scale  with which we are concerned here (think, for example, about  the precision of space trip experiments, which confirm New­ ton's equations to a high degree). On the other hand, as we  have already stated, we live in a pluralistic universe in which  reversible and irreversible processes coexist, all embedded in  the expanding universe.  An even more radical conclusion is to affirm with Einstein  that time as irrevers ibility is an illusion that will never find a  place in the objective world of physics. Fortunately there is  another way out, which we shall explore in Chapter IX. Irre­ versibility , as has been repeatedly stated, is not a universal  property . Therefore, no general derivation of irreversibility from  dynamics is to be expected.  Gibbs' theory of ensembles introduces only one additional  element with respect to trajectory dynamics, but a very impor­ tant one-our ignorance of the precise initial conditions. It is  unlikely that this ignorance alone leads to irreversibility.  We should therefore not be astonished at our failure. We  have not yet formulated the specific features that a dynamic  system has to possess to lead to irreversible processes. </p><div id="pagenum"><p>284</p></div><p id="page">ORDER OUT OF CHAOS 252  Why have so many scientists accepted so readily the sub­ jective interpretation of irreversibility? Perhaps part of its at­ traction lies in the fact that, as we have seen, the irreversible  increase of entropy was at first associated with imperfect ma­ nipulation, with our lack of control over operations that are  ideally reversible.  But this interpretation becomes absurd as soon as the irrele­ vant associations with technological problems are set aside. We  must remember the context that gave the second law its signifi­ cance as nature's arrow of time. According to the subjective  interpretation, chemical affinity , heat conduction, viscosity ,  all the properties connected with irreversible entropy produc­ tion would depend on the observer. Moreover, the extent to  which phenomena of organization originating in irreversibility  play a role in biology makes it impossible to consider them as  simple illusions due to our ignorance. Are we ourselves-liv­ ing creatures capable of observing and manipulating-mere  fictions produced by our imperfect senses? Is the distinction  between life and death an illusion?  Thus recent developments in thermodynamic theory have  increased the violence of the conflict between dynamics and  thermodynamics. Attempts to reduce the results of thermody­ namics to mere approx imations due to our imperfect knowl­ edge seem wrong headed when the constructive role of entropy  is understood and the possibility of an amplificati on of fluctua­ tions is discovered. Conversely , it is difficult to reject dynam­ ics in the name of irreversibility: there is no irreversibility in  the motion of an ideal pendulum. Apparently there are two  conflicting worlds, a world of trajectories and a world of pro­ cesses, and there is no way of denying one by asserting the  other.  To a certain extent, there is an analogy between this conflict  and the one that gave rise to dialectical materialism. We have  described in Chapters V and VI a nature that might be called  "historical"-that is, capable of development and innovation.  The idea of a history of nature as an integral part of material­ ism was asserted by Marx and, in greater detail, by Engels.  Contemporary developments in physics, the discovery of the  constructive role played by irreversibili ty, have thus raised  within the natural sciences a question that has long been asked  by materialists. For them, understanding nature meant under-</p><div id="pagenum"><p>285</p></div><p id="page">253 THE CLASH OF DOCTRINES  standing it as being capable of producing man and his so­ cieties.  Moreover , at the time Engels wrote his Dialectics of Nature,  the physical sciences seemed to have rejected the mechanistic  world view and drawn closer to the idea of an historical  development of nature. Engels mentions three fundamental  discoveries: energy and the laws governing its qualitative  transformations, the cell as the basic constituent of life, and  Darwin's discovery of the evolution of species. In view of  these great discoveries, Engels came to the conclusion that the  mechanistic world view was dead.  But mechanicism remained a basic difficulty facing dialecti­ cal materialism. What are the relations between the general  laws of dialectics and the equally universal laws of mechanical  motion? Do the latter "cease" to apply after a certain stage has  been reached, or are they simply false or incomplete? To come  back to our previous question, how can the world of processes  and the world of trajectories ever be linked together?I9  However , while it is easy to criticize the subjectivistic inter­ pretation of irreversibility and to point out its weakness, it is  not so easy to go beyond it and formulate an "objective" the­ ory of irreversible processes. The history of this subject has  some dramatic overtones. Many people believe that it is the  recognition of the basic difficulties involved that may have led  to Boltzmann's suicide in 1906.  Boltzmann and the Arrow of Time  As we have noted, Boltzmann at first thought that he could  prove that the arrow of time was determined by the evolution  of dynamic systems toward states of higher probability or a  higher number of complexions: there would be a one-way in­ crease of the number of complexions with time. We have also  discussed the objections of Poincare and Zermelo. Poincare  proved that every closed dynamic system reverts in time to­ ward its previous state. Thus, all states are forever recurring.  How could such a thing as an "arrow of time" be associated  with entropy increase? This led to a dramatic change in Boltz­ mann's attitude. He abandoned his attempt to prove that an ob­ jective arrow of time exists and introduced instead an idea that, </p><div id="pagenum"><p>286</p></div><p id="page">ORDER OUT OF CHAOS 254  in a sense, reduced the law of entropy increase to a tautology.  Now he argued that the arrow of time is only a convention that  we (or perhaps all living beings) introduce into a world in  which there is no objective distinction between past and fu­ ture. Let us cite Boltzmann's reply to Zermelo:  We have the choice of two kinds of picture. Either we  assume that the whole universe is at the present moment  in a very improbable state. Or else we assume that the  aeons during which this improbable state lasts, and the  distance from here to Sirius, are minute if compared with  the age and size of the whole universe . In such a uni­ verse, which is in thermal equilibrium as a whole and  therefore dead, relatively small regions of the size of our  galaxy will be found here and there; regions (which we  may call "worlds") which deviate significantly from ther­ mal equilibrium for relatively short stretches of those  "aeons" of time. Among these worlds the probabilities of  their state (i.e. the entropy) will increase as often as they  decrease. In the universe as a whole the two directions of  time are indistinguisha ble, just as in space there is no up  or down. However , just as at a certain place on the earth's  surface we can call "down" the direction towards the  centre of the earth, so a living organism that finds itself in  such a world at a certain period of time can define the  "direction" of time as going from the less probable state  to the more probable one (the former will be the "past"  and the latter the "future"), and by virtue of this defini­ tion he will find that his own small region, isolated from  the rest of the universe, is "initially" always in an im­ probable state. It seems to me that this way of looking at  things is the only one which allows us to understand the  validity of the second law, and the heat death of each indi­ vidual world, without invoking a unidirectional change of  the entire universe from a definite initial state to a final  state.20  Boltzmann's idea can be made clearer by referring to a dia­ gram proposed by Karl Popper (Figure 29). The arrow of time  would be as arbitrary as the vertical direction determined by  the gravitational field. </p><div id="pagenum"><p>287</p></div><p id="page">255 THE CLASH OF DOCTRINES  Arruw of tiM 1Jf c.hia  •trett"h o£ tiM only ArrllW of ti• or this  atrf'tch ,,, ti•• onlr  t.qui liltri ... level  tnt ropy c-urv• clettr•i ni.aa  the dir•rtion of ti•  Figure 29. Popper's schematic representation of Boltzmann's cosmologi­ cal interpretation of the arrow of time (see text).  Commenting on Boltzmann's text, Popper has written:  I think that Boltzmann's idea is staggering in its boldness  and beauty. But I also think that it is quite untenable, at  least for a realist. It brands unidirectional change as an  illusion. This makes the catastrophe of Hiroshima an illu­ sion. Thus it makes our world an illusion, and with it all  our attempts to find out more about our world. It is there­ fore self-defeating (like every idealism). Boltzmann's ide­ alistic ad hoc hypothesis clashes with his own realistic  and almost passionately maintained anti-idealistic philos­ ophy, and with his passionate wish to know.21  We fully agree with Popper's comments, and we believe that  it is time to take up Boltzmann's task once again. As we have  said, the twentieth century has seen a great conceptual revolu­ tion in theoretical physics, and this has produced new hopes  for the unification of dynamics and thermodynamics. We are  now entering a new era in the history of time, an era in which  both being and becoming can be incorporated into a single  noncontradictory vision. </p><div id="pagenum"><p>288</p></div><p id="page"></p><div id="pagenum"><p>289</p></div><p id="page">CHAPTER IX  IRREVERSIBILITY­ THEENTROPY  BARRIER  Entropy and the Arrow of Time  In the preceding chapter we described some difficulties in the  microscopic theory of irreversible processes. Its relation with  dynamics, either classical or quantum, cannot be simple, in  the sense that irreversibility and its concomitant increase of  entropy cannot be a general consequence of dynamics. A mi­ croscopic theory of irreversible processes will require addi­ tional, more specific conditions. We must accept a pluralistic  world in which reversible and irreversible processes coexist.  Yet such a pluralistic world is not easy to accept.  In his Dictionnaire Philosoph ique Voltaire wrote the follow­ ing about destiny:  ... everything is governed by immutable laws •.. ev­ erything is prearranged ... everything is a necessary  effect .... There are some people who, frightened by  this truth, allow half of it, like debtors who offer their  creditors half their debt, asking for more time to pay the  remainder . There are, they say, events which are neces­ sary and others which are not. It would be strange if a  part of what happens had to happen and another part did  not .•.. I necessarily must have the passion to write this,  and you must have the passion to condemn me; we are  both equally foolish, both toys in the hands of destiny.  Your nature is to do ill, mine is to love truth, and to pub­ lish it in spite of you.1  257 </p><div id="pagenum"><p>290</p></div><p id="page">ORDER OUT OF CHAOS 258  Howeve r convincing they may sound, such a priori argu­ ments can lead us astray. Voltaire's reasoning is Newtonian :  nature always conforms to itself. But, curiously, today we find  ourselves in the strange world mocked by Voltaire; we are as­ tonished to discover the qualitativ e diversity presented by na­ ture.  It is not surprising that people have vacillated between the  two extremes; between the elimination of irreversibility from  physics, advocated by Einstein, as we have mentioned ,2 and,  on the contrary, the emphasis on the importance of irreversibil­ ity, as in Whitehead' s concept of process. There can be no doubt  that irreversibility exists on the macroscopic level and has an  important constructive role, as we have shown in Chapters V  and VI. Therefore there must be something in the microscopic  world of which macroscopic irreversibility is the manifesta­ tion.  The microscopic theory has to account for two closely  related elements. First of all, we must follow Boltzmann in  attempting to construct a microscopic model for entropy  (Boltzmann's .J{ function) that changes uniformly in time. This  change has to define our arrow of time. The increase of en­ tropy for isolated systems has to express the aging of the sys­ tem.  Often we may have an arrow of time without being able to  associate entropy with the type of processes considered. Pop­ per gives a simple example of a system presentin g a unid irec­ tional process and therefore an arrow of time.  Suppose a film is taken of a large surface of water ini­ tially at rest into which a stone is dropped. The reversed  film will show contracting, circular waves of increasing  amplitude. Moreover, immediately behind the highest  wave crest, a circular region of undisturbed water will  close in towards the centre. This cannot be regarded as a  possible classical process. It would demand a vast num­ ber of distant coherent generators of waves the coordina­ tion of which, to be explicabl e, would have to be shown,  in the film, as originating from one centr e. This, however,  raises pr ecisely the same difficulty again, if we try to re­ verse the amended film. 3 </p><div id="pagenum"><p>291</p></div><p id="page">259 IRREVERSIBILITY-THE ENTROPY BARRIER  Indeed, whatever the technical means, there will always be  a distance from the center beyond which we are unable to gen­ erate a contracting wave. There are unidirectional processes.  Many other processes of the type presented by Popper can be  imagined: we never see energy coming from all directions con­ verge on a star, together with the backward-r unning nuclear  reactions that would absorb that energy.  In addition , there exist other arrows of time-for example,  the cosmological arrow (see the excellent account by M.  Gardner '). If we assume that the universe started with a Big  Bang, this obviously implies a temporal order on the cos­ mological level. The size of the universe continues to increase,  but we cannot identify the radius of the universe with entropy.  Indeed, as we already mentioned , inside the expanding uni­ verse we find both reversible and irreversible processes. Sim­ ilarly, in elementary-particle physics there exist processes that  present the so-called T-violation. The T-violation implies that  the equations describing the evolution of the system for +tare  different from those describing the evolution for -t. However ,  this T-violation does not prevent us from including it in the  usual (Hamiltonian) formulation of dynamics. No entropy  function can be defined as a result of the T-violati on.  We are reminded of the celebrated discussion between Ein­ stein and Ritz published in 1909.5 This is a quite unusual pa­ per, a very short one, less than a printed page long. It simply is  a statement of disagreement. Einstein argued that irreversibil­ ity is a consequence of the probability concept introduced by  Boltzmann . On the contrary, Ritz argued that the distinction  between "retarded" and "advanced" waves plays an essential  role. This distinction reminds us of Popper's argument. The  waves we observe in the pond are retarded waves; they follow  the dropping of the stone.  Both Einstein and Ritz introduced essential elements into  the discussion of irreversibility, but each of them emphasized  only part of the story. We have already mentioned in Chapter  VIII that probability presupposes a direction of time and  therefore cannot be used to derive the arrow of time. We have  also mentioned that the exclusion of processes such as ad­ vanced waves does not necessarily lead to a formulation of the  second law. We need both types of arguments. </p><div id="pagenum"><p>292</p></div><p id="page">ORDER OUT OF CHAOS 260  Irreversibility as a Syrr1metry-B reaking Process  Before discussing the problem of irreversibility, it is useful to  remember how another type of symmetry-breaking, spatial  symmetry-br eaking, can be derived. In the equations describ­ ing reaction-diffusion systems, left and right play the same  role (the diffusion equations remain invariant when we per­ form the space inversion r-+-r). Still, as we have seen, bifurca­ .tions may lead to solutions in which this symmetry is broken  (see Chapter V). For example, the concentration of some of  the components may become higher on the left than on the  right. The symmetry of the equations only requires that the sym­ metry-breaking solutions appear in pairs.  There are, of course, many reaction-diffusion equations that  do not present bifurcations and that therefore cannot break  spatial symmetry. The breaking of spatial symmetry requires  other highly specific conditions. This is valuable for under­ standing temporal symmet ry-breaking, in which we are pri­ marily interested here. We have to find systems in which the  equations of motion may have realizations of lower symmetry.  The equations are indeed invariant in respect to time inver­ sion t-+-t. However, the realization of these equations may  correspond to evolutions that lose this symmet ry. The only  condition imposed by the symmetry of equations is that such  realizations appear in pairs. If, for example, we find one solu­ tion going to equilibrium in the far distant future (and not in  the far distant past), we should also find a solution that goes to  equilibrium in the far distant past (and not in the far distant  future). Symmetry-broken solutions appear in pairs.  Once we find such a situation we can express the intrinsic  meaning of the second law. It becomes a selection principle  stating that only one of the two types of solutions can be real­ ized or may be observed in nature. Whenever applicable, the  second law expresses an intrinsic polarization of nature. It can  never be the outcome of dynamics itself. It has to appear as a  supplementary selection principle that when realized is propa­ gated by dynamics. Only a few years ago it seemed impossible  to attempt such a program. However, over the past few de-</p><div id="pagenum"><p>293</p></div><p id="page">261 IRREVERSIBILITY-THE ENTROPY BARRIER  cades dynamics has made remarkable progress, and we can  now understand in detail how these symmetry-breaking solu­ tions emerge in dynamic systems "of sufficient complexity"  and what the selection rule expressed by the second law of  thermodynamics means on the microscopic level. This is what  we want to show in the next part of this chapter.  The Limits of Classical Concep ts  Let us start with classical mechanics. As we have already  mentioned, if trajectory is to be the basic irreducible element,  the world would be as reversible as the trajectories out of  which it is formed. In this description there would be no en­ tropy and no arrow of time; but, as a result of unexpected re·  cent developmen ts, the validity of the trajectory concept  appears far more limited than we might have expected. Let us  return to Gibbs' and Einstein' s theory of ensemb les, intro­ duced in Chapter VIII. We have seen that Gibbs and Einstein  introduced phase space into physics to account for the fact  that we do not "know" the initial state of systems formed by a  large number of particles. For them, the distribution function  in phase space was only an auxiliary construction expressing  our de facto ignorance of a situation that was well determined  de jure. However, the entire problem takes on new dimensions  once it can be shown that for certain types of systems an infi·  nitely precise determination of initial conditions leads to a  self-contradi ctory procedure . Once this is so, the fact that we  never know a single trajectory but a group, an ensemble of  trajectories in phase space, is not a mere expression of the  limits of our knowledge. It becomes a starting point of a new  way of investigating dynamics.  It is true that in simple cases there is no problem. Let us  take the example of a pendulum . It may oscillate or else rotate  about its axis according to the initial conditions. For it to ro­ tate, its kinetic energy must be large enough for it not to "fall  back" before reaching a vertical position. These two types of  motion define two disjointed regions of phase space. The rea­ son for this is very simple: rotation requires more energy than  oscillation (see Figure 30). </p><div id="pagenum"><p>294</p></div><p id="page">y  0)  v  b) ORDER OUT OF CHAOS 262  a  Figure 30.

We can increase the accu-</p><div id="pagenum"><p>295</p></div><p id="page">263 IRREVERSIBILITY- THE ENTROPY BARRIER  racy of our measurements and localize the initial state of the  pendulum in a smaller region circumscribed by the first. In  any case, we know the system's behavior for all time; nothing  new or unexpected is likely to occur.  One of the most surprising results achieved in the twentieth  century is that such a description is not valid in general. On  the contrary, "most" dynamic systems behave in a quite un­ stable way. 6 Let us indicate one kind of trajectory (for exam­ ple, that of oscillation) by + and another kind (for example,  that corresponding to rotation) by *· Instead of Figure 30,  where the two regions were separated, we find, in general, a  mixture of states that makes the transition to a single point  ambiguous (see Figure 31). If we know only that the initial  state of our system is in region A, we cannot deduce that its  trajectory is of type +; it may equally well be of type *· We  achieve nothing by increasing the accurac y by going from re­ gion A to a smaller region within it, for the uncertainty re­ mains. In all regions, however small, there are always states  belonging to each of the two types of trajectories.1  v  Figure 31. Schematic representation of any region, arbitrarily small, of the  phase space V tor a system presenting dynamic instability. As in the case of  the pendulum, there are two types of trajectories (represented here by +  and •); however, in contrast with the pendulum, both motions appear in every  region arbitrary small. </p><div id="pagenum"><p>296</p></div><p id="page">265 IRREVERSIBILITY-THE ENTROPY BARRIER  that at the end of the nineteenth century Bruns and Poincare  demonstr ated that most dynamic systems, starting with the  famous "three body" problem, were not integrable.

Great contributions to the theory of ergodic systems have  been made by Birchoff, von Neumann, Hopf, Kolmogo roff,  and Sinai, to mention only a few. s. 9. tO Today we know that  there are large classes of dynamic (though non-Hamiltonian)  systems that are ergodic.

Each time the surface of the square is broken up and re­ distribut ed. The square corresponds here to the phase space.  The baker transformation transforms each point into a well­ defined new point. Although the series of points obtained in  this way is "determinist ic," the system displays in addition  irreducibly statistical aspects. Let us take, for instance, a sys­ tem described by an initial condition such that a region A of  the square is initially filled in a uniform way with representa­ tive points. It may be shown that after a sufficient number of  repetitions of the transformation, this cell, whatever its size  and localization, will be broken up into pieces (see Figure 37).  The essential point is that any region, whatever its size, thus </p><div id="pagenum"><p>302</p></div><p id="page">p ORDER OUT OF CHAOS 270  q  Figure 37. Time evolution of an unstable system. Time going on, region A  splits into regions A' and A", which in turn will be divided.  always contains different trajectories diverging at each frag­ mentation. Although the evolution of a point is reversible and  deterministic , the description of a region, however small, is  basically statistical.  A similar example involves the scattering of hard spheres.  We may consider a small sphere rebounding on a collection of  large, randomly distributed spheres. The latter are supposed  to be fixed. This is the model physicists call the "Lorentz  model," after the name of a great Dutch physicist, Hendrik  Antoon Lorentz .  The trajectory of the small mobile sphere is well defined.  Howeve r, whenever we introduce the smallest uncertainty in  the initial conditions, this uncertainty is amplified through  successive collision s. As time passes, the probability of find­ ing the small sphere in a given volume become s uniform.  Whatever the number of transformations, we never return to  the original state.  In the last two examples we have strongly unstable dynamic  systems. The situation is reminiscent of instabilities as they  appear in thermodynamic systems (see Chapter V). Arbitrar­ ily small differences in initial conditions are amplified.

The description in  terms of ensembles has to be taken as the starting point. Sta­ tistical concepts are no longer merely an approximation with  respect to some "objective truth." When faced with these un­ stable systems, Laplace's demon is just as powerless as we.  Einstein's saying, "God does not play dice," is well known.  In the same spirit Poincare stated that for a supreme mathe­ matician there is no place for probabilities. However , Poincare  himself mapped the path leading to the answer to this prob­ lem.11 He noticed that when we throw dice and use proba bility  calculus, it does not mean that we suppose dynamics to be  wrong. It means something quite different. We apply the prob­ ability concept because in each interval of initial conditions,  however small, there are as "many" trajectories that lead to  each of the faces of the dice. This is precisely what happens  with unstable dynamic systems. God could, if he wished to, </p><div id="pagenum"><p>304</p></div><p id="page">ORDER OUT OF CHAOS 272  calculate the trajectories in an unstable dynamic world. He  would obtain the same result as probability calculus permits  us to reach. Of course, if he made use of his absolute knowl­ edge, then he could get rid of all randomness.  In conclusion, there is a close relationship between instabil­ ity and probability . This is an important point, and we want to  discuss it now.  From Randomness to Irreversibility  Consider a succession of squares to which we apply the baker  transformation. This succession is represented in Figure 39. A  shaded region may be imagined to be filled with ink, an un­ shaded region by water. At time zero we have what is called a  generating partition. Out of this partition we form a series of  either horizontal partitions when we go into the future or ver­ tical partitions going into the past. These are the basic parti­ tions. An arbitrary distribution of ink in the square can be  written formally as a superposition of the basic partitions. To  each basic partition we may associate an "internal" time that  is simply the number of baker transformations we have to per­ form to go from the generating partition to the one under con­ sideration.I2 We therefor e see that this type of system admits a  kind of internal age.*  The internal time Tis quite different from the usual mechan­ ical time, since it depends on the global topology of the sys­ tem. We may even speak of the "timing of space," thus coming  close to ideas recently put forward by geographe rs, who have in­ troduced the concept of "chronogeog raphy." 13 When we look at  the structure of a town, or of a landscape , we see temporal  elements interacting and coexisting. Brasilia or Pompeii would  correspond to a well-defined internal age, somewhat like one  of the basic partitions in the baker transformation. On the con­ trary, modern Rome, whose buildings originated in quite dif- *It may be noticed that this internal time, which we shall denote by T. is in  fact an operator like those introduced in quantum mechanics (see Chapter  VII). Indeed, an arbitrary partition of the square does not have a well­ defined time but only an "average" time corresponding to the superposition  of the basic partitions out of which it is formed. </p><div id="pagenum"><p>305</p></div><p id="page">273 IRREVERSIBILITY-THE ENTROPY BARRIER  -m-- -= - •1 0 z  t  genart1ting partition past future  Figure 39. Starting with the "generating partition" (see text) at time 0, we  repeatedly apply the baker transformation. We generate horizontal stripes in  this way. Similarly going into the past we obtain vertical stripes.  ferent periods, would correspond to an average time exactly as  an arbitrary partition may be decomposed into elements cor­ responding to different internal times.  Let us again look at Figure 39. What happens if we go into  the far distant future? The horizontal bands of ink will get  closer and closer. Whatever the precision of our measurements,  after some time we shall conclude that the ink is uniformly  distributed over the volume. It is therefore not surprising that  this kind of approach to "equilibrium" may be mapped into a  stochastic process, such as the Markov chain we described in  Chapter VIII. Recently this has been shown with full mathe­ matical rigor, 14 but the result seems to us quite natural. As  time passes, the distribution of ink reaches equilibrium, ex­ actly like the distribution of balls in the urn experiment dis­ cussed in Chapter VIII. However, when we look into the past ,  again beginning from the generating partition at time zero, we  see the same phenomenon. Now ink is distributed along shrink­ ing vertical sections and, again, sufficiently far in the past we  shall find a uniform distribution of ink. We may therefore con­ clude that we can also model this process in terms of a Markov  chain, now, however , oriented toward the past. We see that out  of the unstable dynamic processes we obtain two Markov  chains, one reaching equilibrium in the future, one in the past.  We believe that it is a very interesting result � and we would  like to commen t it. Internal time provides us with a new 'non­ local' descripti on.  When we know the 'age' of the system, (that is, the corre­ sponding partition), we can still not associate to it a well-de­ fined local trajectory. </p><div id="pagenum"><p>306</p></div><p id="page">ORDER OUT OF CHAOS 274  We know only that the system is in a shaded region (Figure  39). Similarly, if we know some precise initial conditions cor­ responding to a point in the system, we don't know the parti­ tion to which it belongs, nor the age of the system. For such  systems we know the refore two complem entary descriptions ,  and the situation becomes some what reminiscent of the one  we described in Chapter VII, when we discussed quantum me­ chanics.  It is because of the existence of this new alternative, non­ local description, that we can make the transition from dy­ namics to probabilities. We call the systems for which this is  possible "intrinsically random systems" .  In classical deterministic systems, we may use transition  probabilities to go from one point to another on a quite degen­ erate sense. This transition probability will be equal to one if  the two points lie on the same dynamic trajectory, or zero if  they are not.  In contrast, in genuine probability theory, we need transi­ tion probabilities which are positive numbers between zero  and one. How is this possible? Here we see in full light the  conflict between subjectivistic views and objective inte rpreta­ tions of probability. The subjective interpretation corresponds  to the situation where individual trajectories are not known.  Probability (and, eventually , irreversibility, closely related to  it) would originate from our ignorance. But fortunately , there  is another ob jective interpretatio n: probability arises as a re­ sult of an alternative description of dynamics, a non-local de­ scription which arises in strongly unstable dynamical systems .  Here, probability becomes an objective property generated  from the inside of dynamics, so to speak, and which expresses  a basic structure of the dynamical system. We have stressed  the importance of Boltzmann's basic discovery: the connec­ tion between entropy and probabili ty. For intrinsic random  systems, the concept of probability acquires a dynamical  meaning. We have now to make the transition from intrinsic  random systems to irreversible systems . We have seen that out  of unstable dynamical processes , we obtain two Markov  chains.  We may see this duality in a different way. Take a distribu­ tion concentrated on a line (instead of being distributed on a  surface). This line may be vertical or horizontal. Let us look at </p><div id="pagenum"><p>307</p></div><p id="page">275 IRREVERSIBILITY-THE ENTROPY BARRIER  what will happen to this line when we apply the baker transfor­ mation going to the future. The result is represented in Figure  40. The vertical line is cut successively into pieces and will  reduce to a point in the far distant future. The horizontal line,  on the contrary, is duplicated and will uniformly "cover" the  surface in the far distant future. Obviously, just the opposite  happens if we go to the past. For reasons that are easy to un­ derstand, the vertical line is called a contracting fiber, the  horizontal line a dilating fiber.  We see now the complete analogy with bifurcation theory. A  contracting fiber and a dilating fiber correspond to two realiza­ tions of dynamics, each involving symmetry-breaking and appear­ ing in pairs. The contracting tiber corresponds to equilibrium in  the far distant past, the dilating fiber to the future. We therefore  have two Markov chains oriented in opposite time directions.  Now we have to make the transistion from intrinsically ran­ dom to intrinsically irreversible systems. To do so we must  understand more precisely the difference between contracting  and dilating fibers. We have seen that another system as unsta- I  Figure 40.

Here contracting and dilating fibers have a sim-</p><div id="pagenum"><p>308</p></div><p id="page">ORDER OUT OF CHAOS 276  pie physical interpretation. A contracting fiber corresponds to  a collection of hard spheres whose velocities are randomly dis­ tributed in the far distant past, and all become parallel in the  far distant future. A dilating fiber corresponds to the inverse  situation, in which we start with parallel velocities and go to a  random distribution of velocities. Therefore the difference is  very similar to the one between incoming waves and outgoing  waves in the example given by Popper. The exclusion of the  contracting fibers corresponds to the experimental fact that  whatever the ingenuit y of the experimenter , he will never be  able to control the system to produce parallel velocities after  an arbitrary number of collision s. Once we exclude con·  tracting fibers we are left with only one of the two possible  Markov chains we have introduced. In other words, the sec­ ond law becomes a selection principle of initial conditions .  Only initial conditions that go to equilibrium in the future are  retained.  Obviously the validity of this selection principle is main­ tained by dynamics. It can easily be seen in the example of the  baker transformation that the contracting fiber remains a con­ tracting fiber for all times, and likewise for a dilating fiber. By  suppressing one of the two Markov chains we go from an  intrinsically random system to an intrinsically irreversible sys­ tem. We find three basic elements in the description of irre­ versibility:  instability  f  intrinsic randomness  f  ·intrinsic irreversibility  Intrinsic irreversibilit y is the strongest property: it implies  randomness and instabilit y.t4, ts  How is this conclusion comp atible with dynamics? As we  have seen, in dynamics "information" is conserv ed, while in  Markov chains information is lost (and entropy therefore in­ creases; see Chapter VIII). There is, however , no contradic­ tion; when we go from the dynamic description of the baker  transformation to the thermodynamic description, we have to </p><div id="pagenum"><p>309</p></div><p id="page">277 IRREVERSIBILITY-THE ENTROPY BARRIER  modify our distribution function; the "objects" in terms of  which entropy increases are different from the ones consid­ ered in dynamics. The new distribution function, p, corre­ sponds to an intrinsically time-oriented description of the  dynamic system. In this book we cannot dwell on the mathe­ matical aspects of this transformation. Let us only emphasize  that it has to be noncanonical (see Chapter II). We must aban­ don the usual formulations of dynamics to reach the ther­ modynamic description.  It is quite remarkable that such a transformation exists and  that as a result we can now unify dynamics and thermodynam­ ics, the physics of being and the physics of becoming. We shall  come back to these new thermodynamic objects later in this  chapter as well as in our concluding chapter. Let us emphasize  only that at equilibrium, whenever entropy reaches its max­ imum, these objects must behave randomly.  It also seems quite remarkable that irreversibility emerges, so  to speak, from instability, which introduces irreducible statisti­ cal features into our descript ion. Indeed, what could an arrow  of time mean in a deterministic world in which both future and  past are contained in the present? It is because the future is  not contained in the present and that we go from the present to  the future that the arrow of time is associated with the transition  from present to future. This construction of irreversibility out of  randomness has, we believe, many consequences that go  beyond science proper and to which we shall come back in our  concluding chapter. Let us clarify the difference between the  states permitted by the second law and those it prohibits .  The Entropy Barrier  Time flows in a single direction, from past to future. We can­ not manipulate time, we cannot travel back to the past. Travel  through time has preoccupied writers, from The Thousand  and One Nights to H. G. Wells' The Time Machine. In our  time, Nabokov's short novel, Look at the Harlequins!, 1' de­ scribes the torment of a narrator who finds himself as unable  to switch from one spatial direction to the other as we are to </p><div id="pagenum"><p>310</p></div><p id="page">ORDER OUT OF CHAOS 278  "twirl time." In the fifth volume of Science and Civilization in  China, Needham describes the dream of the Chinese alche­ mists: their supreme aim was not to achieve the transmutation  of metals into gold but to manipulate time, to reach immor­ tality through a radical slowdown of natural decaying pro­ cesses. I? We are now better able to understand why we cannot  "twirl time," to use Nabokov's expression.  An infinite entropy barrier separates possible initial condi­ tions from prohibited ones. Because this barrier is infinite,  technological progress never will be able to overcome it. We  have to abandon the hope that one day we will be able to travel  back into our past. The situation is somewhat analogous to the  barrier presented by the velocity of light. Technological prog­ ress can bring us closer to the velocity of light, but in the pres­ ent views of physics we will never cross it.  To understand the origin of this barrier, let us return to the  expression of the :H quantity as it appears in the theory of  Markov chains (see Chapter VIII). To each distribution we can  associate a number-the corresponding value of J-{. We can  say that to each distribution corresponds a well-defined infor­ mation content. The higher the information content, the more  difficult it will be to realize the corresponding state. What we  wish to show here is that the initial distribution prohibited by  the second law would have an infinite information content.  That is the reason why we can neither realize them nor find  them in nature.  Let us first come back to the meaning of :Has presented in  Chapter VIII. We have to subdivide the relevant phase space  into sectors or boxes. With each box k, we associate an proba­ bility Peqm(k) at equilibrium as well as a non-equilibrium prob­ ability P(k,t).  The :H is a measure of the difference between P(k,t) and  Peqm(k), and vanishes at equilibrium when this difference dis­ appears. Therefore, to compare the Baker transformation with  Markov chains, we have to make more precise the correspond­ ing choice of boxes. Suppose we consider a system at time 2  (see Figure 39), and suppose that this system originated at  time ti. Then, a result of our dynamical theory is that the  boxes correspond to all possible intersections among the par­ titions between timet; and t=2. If we consider now Figure 39.  we see that when ti is receding towards the past, the boxes will </p><div id="pagenum"><p>311</p></div><p id="page">279 IRREVERSI BILITY-THE ENTROPY BARRIER  become steadily thinner as we have to introduce more and  more vertical subdivisions. This is expressed in Figure 41, se­ quence B, where, going from top to bottom, we have ti = 1, 0,  -1, and finally ti = -2. We see indeed that the number of  boxes increases in this way from 4 to 32.  Once we have the boxes, we can compar e the non-equi­ librium distribution with the equilibrium distribution for each  box. In the present case, the non-equilibrium distribution is  either a dilating fiber (sequence A) or a contracting fiber (se­ quence C). The important point to notice is that when ti is  receding to the past, the dilating fiber occupies an increasing  large number of boxes: for ti = -2 it occupies 4 boxes, for  ti = -2 it occupies 8 boxes, and so on.  As a result, when we apply the formula given in Chapter  VIII, we obtain a finite result, even if the number of boxes  goes to infinity for tr-+ -oo .  In contrast, the contracting fiber remains always localized  in 4 boxes whatever ti. As a result, .Jl, when applied to a con- A 8 c  Figure 41. Dilating (sequence A) and contracting (sequence C) fibers  cross various numbers of the boxes which subdivide a Baker transformation  phase space. All"squares" on a given sequence refer to the same time, t=2,  but the number of the boxes subdividing each square depends on the initial  time of the system ti. </p><div id="pagenum"><p>312</p></div><p id="page">ORDER OUT OF CHAOS 280  tracting fiber, diverges to infinity when ti recedes to the past.  In summary, the difference between a dynamical system and  the Markov chain is that the number of boxes to be consider ed  in a dynamical system is infinite. It is this fact that leads to a  selection principle. Only measures or probabili ties, which in  the limit of infinite number of boxes give a finite information  or a finite J{ quantity , can be prepared or observed. This ex­ cludes contracting fibers.ts For the same reason we must also  exclude distributions concentrated on a single point. Initial  conditions corresponding to a single point in unstable systems  would again correspond to infinite information and are there­ fore impossible to realize or observe . Again we see that the  second law appears as a selection principle.  In the classical scheme , initial conditions were arbitrary.  This is no longer so for unstable systems. Here we can associ­ ate an information content to each initial condition, and this  information content itself depends on the dynamics of the sys­ tem (as in the baker transformation we used the successive  fragmentation of the cells to calculate the information con­ tent). Initial conditions and dynamics are no longer indepen­ dent. The second law as a selection rule seems to us so  important that we would like to give another illustration based  on the dynamics of correlations.  The Dynamics of Correlati ons  In Chapter VIII we discussed briefly the velocity inversion  experiment. We may consider a dilute gas and follow its evolu­ tion in time. At time t0 we proceed to a velocity inversion of  each molecule. The gas then returns to its initial state. We  have already noted that for the gas to retrace its past there  must be some storage of information. This storage can be de­ scribed in terms of "correlations" between parti cles.t9  Consider first a cloud of particles directed toward a target (a  heavy, motionless particle). This situation is described in Fig­ ure 42. In the far distant past, there were no correlations be­ tween particles. Now, scattering has two eff ects, already  mentioned in Chapter VIII. It disperses the particles (it makes  the velocity distribution more symmetrical) and, in addition, it </p><div id="pagenum"><p>313</p></div><p id="page">281 IRREVERSIBILITY- THE ENTROPY BARRIER  produces correlations between the scattered particles and the  scatterer. The corr elations can be made explicit by performing  a velocity inversion (that is, by introducing a spherical mirror).  Figure 43 represents this situation (the wavy lines represent  the correlation s). Therefore, the role of scattering is as fol­ lows: In the direct process, it makes the velocity distribution  more symmetrical and creates correlations; in the inverse pro­ cess, the velocity distribution becomes less symmetrical and  correlati ons disappea r. We see that the consider ation of cor- •  .. 0 .. -....... •  • •  Figure 42. Scattering of particles. Initially all particles have the same ve­ locity.

We can apply our conclusions to many-body systems. Here  also we may consider two types of situations: in one, uncorre­ lated particles enter, are scattere d, and correlated particles are  produced (see Figure 44). In the opposite situation, correlated  • •  • ..  � 0 • ..  • ..  Figure 43. Effect of a velocity inversion after a collision: after the new  "inverted" collision, the correlations are suppressed and all particles have  the same velocity. </p><div id="pagenum"><p>314</p></div><p id="page">ORDER OUT OF CHAOS 282  particles enter, the correlations are destroyed through colli­ sions, and uncorrelated particles result (see Figure 45).  The two situations differ in the temporal order of collisions  and correlations. In the first case, we have "postcollisional"  correlations. With this distinction between pre-and postcolli­ sional correlations in mind, let us return to the velocity inver­ sion experiment. We start at t = 0, with an initial state  corresponding to no correlations between particle s. During  the time o�t0 we have a "normal" evolution. Collisions bring  the velocity distribution closer to the Maxwellian equilibrium  distribution. They also create postcollisi onal correlations be- 0 0  0 0  before after  Figure 44. Creation of postcollisional correlations represented by wavy  lines; for details see text.  tween the particles . At t0 after the velocity inversion, a com­ pletely new situation arises. Postcollisional correlations are  now transformed into precollisional correlations. In the time  interval between t0 and 2t0, these precollisional corr elations  disappear, the velocity distribution becomes less symmet-rical,  and at time 2t0 we are back in the noncorr elational state. The  history of this system therefore has two stages. During the  0 0  0 � I after 0  before  Figure 45.

Both types of pro­ cesses are compatible with the laws of dynamics. Moreover, as  we have mentioned in Chapter VIII, the total "information"  described by dynamics remains constant. We have also seen  that in Boltzmann's description the evolution from time 0 till t0  corresponds to the usual decrease of J{, while from t0 to 2t0 we  have an abnormal situation : J{ would increase and entropy de­ crease. We would then be able to devise experime nts in the  laboratory or on computers in which the second Jaw would be  violated! The irreversibility during time 0-t0 would be "com­ pensated" by "anti-irrev ersibility" during time t0-2t0•  This is quite unsatisfactory. All these difficulties disappear  if we go, as in the baker transformation , to the new "thermody­ namic representa tion" in terms of which dynamics becomes a  probabilistic process like a Markov chain. We must also take  into account that velocity inversion is not a "natural" process;  it requires that "information" be given to molecules from the  outside for them to invert their velocity. We need a kind of  Maxwellian demon to perform the velocity inversio ns, and  Maxwell's demon has a price. Let us represent the J{ quantity  (for the probabilistic process) as a function of time. This is  done in Figure 46. In this approach, in contrast with Boltz ­ mann's, the effect of correlations is retained in the new defini­ tion of :H. Therefore at the velocity inversion point t0 the J{  quantity will jump, since we abruptly create abnormal precolli­ sional correlations that will have to be destroyed later. This  jump corresponds to the entropy or information price we have  to pay.  Now we have a faithful representation of the second law: at  every moment the J{ quantity decreases (or the entropy in­ creases). There is one exception at time t0: J{ jumps upward,  but that corresponds to the very moment at which the system  is open. We can invert the velocities only by acting from the  outside.  There is another essential point: at time t0 the new J{ quan­ tity has two different values, one for the system before ve­ locity inversion and the other after a velocity inversion. These  two situations have different entropies. This resembles what  occurs in the baker transformation when the contracting and  dilating fibers are velocity inversions of each other. </p><div id="pagenum"><p>316</p></div><p id="page">ORDER OUT OF CHAOS 284  Suppose we wait a sufficient time before making the ve­ locity in-version. The postcollisio nal correlations wmdd have  an arbitrary range, and the entropy price for velocity inversion  would become too high. The velocity inversion would then  require too high an entropy price and thus would be excluded.  In physical terms this means that the second law excludes per­ sistent long-range precollisional correlations.  The analogy with the macroscopic description of the second  law is striking. From the point of view of energy conservation  (see Chapters IV and V), heat and work play the same role,  I  I  I  I I I I I I �------·�----�---+t  t0 2t0  Figure 46.

At time 2t0 the system is in the same state as at ti_me 0, and .Jl  recovers the value it had initially. At all times (except at t0), J-l is decreasing.  The important fact is that at time t0 the J-l-quantity takes two different values  (see text).  but no longer from the point of view of the second law. Briefly  speaking, work is a more coherent form of energy and always  can be converted into heat, but the inverse is not true. There is  on the microscopic level a similar distinction between colli­ sions and correlations. From the point of view of dynamics, colli­ sions and correlations play equivalent roles. Collisions give  rise to correlations, and correlations may destroy the effect of </p><div id="pagenum"><p>317</p></div><p id="page">285 IRREVERS IBILITY-THE ENTROPY BARRIER  collisions. But there is an essential difference. We can control  collisions and produce correlations, but we cannot control cor­ relations in a way that will destroy the effects collisions have  brought into the system. It is this essential difference that is  missing in dynamics but that can be incorporated into thermody ­ namics. Note that thermody namics does not enter into conflict  with dynamics at any point. It adds an additional, essential  element to our understanding of the physical world.  Entropy as a Selection Principle  It is amazing how closely the microscopic theory of irrevers­ ible processes resembles traditional macroscopic theory. In both  cases entropy initially has a negative meaning. In its macroscopic  aspect it prohibits some processes, such as heat flowing from  cold to hot. In its microscopic aspect it prohibits certain  classes of initial conditions. The distinction between what is  permitted and what is prohibited is maintained in time by the  laws of dynamic s. It is from the negative aspect that the posi­ tive aspect emerges: the existence of entropy together with its  probability interpretation. Irreversibility no longer emerges as  if by a miracle at some macroscopic level. Macroscopic irre­ versibility only makes apparent the time-oriented polarized  nature of the universe in which we live.  As we have emphasized repeatedly, there exist in nature sys­ tems that behave reversibly and that may be fully described by  the laws of classical or quantum mechanics. But most systems  of interest to us, including all chemical systems and therefore  all biological systems, are time-oriented on the macroscopic  level. Far from being an "illusion ," this expresses a broken  time-symmetry on the microscopic level. Irreversibility is ei­ ther true on all levels or on none. It cannot emerge as if by a  miracle, by going from one level to another.  Also we have already noticed, irreversibility is the starting  point of other symmetry breakings. For example, it is gener­ ally accepted that the difference between particles and anti­ particles could arise only in a nonequilibrium world. This may  be extended to many other situations. It is likely that irrevers­ ibility also played a role in the appearance of chiral symmetry </p><div id="pagenum"><p>318</p></div><p id="page">ORDER OUT OF CHAOS 286  through the selection of the appropria te bifurcation. One of  the most active subjects of research now is the way in which  irreversibility can be "inscribed" into the structur e of matter.  The reader may have noticed that in the derivation of micro­ scopic irreversibility we have been concentrating on classical  dynamic s. However, the ideas of correlations and the distinc­ tion between pre-and postcolli sional correlations apply to  quantum systems as well. The study of quantum systems is  more complicated than the study of classical systems. There is  a reason for this: the difference between classical and quan­ tum mechanics. Even small classical systems, such as those  formed by a few hard spheres, may present intrinsic irrevers­ ibility. However, to reach irreversibility in quantum systems we  need large systems, such as those realized in liquids, gases, or  in field theory. The study of large systems is obviously more  difficult mathematically, and that is why we will not go into the  matter here. However , the situation remains essentially the  same in quantum theory. There also irreversibility begins as  the result of the limitation of the concept of wave function due  to a form of quantum instability .  Moreover, the idea of collisions and correlations may also be  used in quantum theory. Therefore, as in classical theory, the  second law prohibits long-range precollisional correlati ons.  The transition to a probability process introduces new en­ tities, and it is in terms of these new entities that the second  law can be understood as an evolution from order to disorder.  This is an important conclusion. The second law leads to a  new concept of matter. We would like to describe this concept  now.  Active Matter  Once we associate entropy with a dynamic system, we come  back to Boltzmann's conception: the probability will be max­ imum at equilibri um. The units we use to describe thermo­ dynamic evolution will therefore behave in a chaotic way at  equilibrium. In contrast, in near-equilibrium conditions cor­ relations and coherence will appear.  We come to one of our main conclusions; At all levels, be it </p><div id="pagenum"><p>319</p></div><p id="page">287 IRREVERSIBI LITY-THE ENTROPY BARRIER  the level of macroscopic physics, the level of fluctuations, or  the microscopic level, nonequilibrium is the source of order.  Nonequilibrium brings "order out of chaos." But as weal­ ready mentioned, the concept of order (or disorder) is more  complex than was thought. It is only in some limiting situa­ tions, such as with dilute gases, that it acquires a simple mean­ ing in agreement with Boltzmann' s pioneering work.  Let us once more contrast the dynamic description of the  physical world in terms of forces and fields with the thermo­ dynamic description. As we mentioned, we can construct  computer experiments in which interacting particles initially  distributed at random form a lattice. The dynamic interpreta­ tion would be the appearance of order through interparticle  forces. The thermodynamic interpretation is, on the contrary,  the approach to disorder (when the system is isolated), but to  disorder expressed in quite different units, which are in this  case collective modes involving a large number of particles. It  seems to us worthwhile to reintroduce the neologism we used  in Chapter VI to define the new units in terms of which the  system is incoherent at equilibrium: we call them "hypnons,"  sleepwalkers, since they ignore each other at equilibriu m.  Each of them may be as complex as you wish (think about  molecules of the complexity of an enzyme), but at equilibrium  their complexity is turned "inward." Again, inside a molecule  there is an intensive electric field, but this field in a dilute gas  is negligible as far as other molecules are concerned.  One of the m�in subjects in present-da y physics is the prob­ lem of element ary particles. However, we know that elemen­ tary particles are far from elementary. New layers of structur e  are disclosed at higher and higher energies. But what, after all,  is an element ary particle? Is the planet earth an elementary  particle? Certainly not, because part of this energy is in its  interaction with the sun, the moon, and the other planets. The  concept of elementary particles requires an "autonomy" that  is very difficult to describe in terms of the usual concept s.  Thke the case of electrons and photons. We are faced with a  dilemma: either there are no well-defined particles (because  the energy is partly between the electrons and protons), or  there are noninteracting particles if we can eliminate the inter­ action. Even if we knew how to do that, it seems too radical a </p><div id="pagenum"><p>320</p></div><p id="page">ORDER OUT OF CHAOS 288  procedure. Electrons absorb photons or emit photons. A way  out may be to go to the physics of processes. The units, the  elementary particles, would then be defined as hypnons, as  the entities that evolve independen tly at equilibrium. We hope  that there soon will be experiments available to test this hy­ pothesis; it would be quite appealing if atoms interacting with  photons (or unstable elementary particles) already carried the  arrow of time that expresses the global evolution of nature.  A subject widely discussed today is the problem of cosmic  evolution. How could the world near the moment of the Big  Bang be so "ordered"? Yet this order is necessary if we wish  to understand cosmic evolution as the gradual movement from  order to disorder .  To give a satisfactory answer we need to know what "hyp­ nons" could have been appropriate to the extreme conditions  of temperature and density that characterized the early uni­ verse. Thermodynamics alone will not, of course, solve these  problems; neither will dynamic s, even in its most refined form  field theory. That is why the unification of dynamics and ther­ modynamics opens new perspectiv es.  In any case, it is striking how the situation has changed since  the formulation of the second law of thermodynamics one hun­ dred fifty years ago. At first it seemed that the atomistic view  contradicted the concept of entropy. Boltzmann attempted to  save the mechanistic world view at the cost of reducing the  second law to a statement of probability with great practical  importance but no fundamental significa nce. We do not know  what the definitive solution will be; but today the situation is  radically different. Matter is not given. In the present-day view  it has to be constructed out of a more fundamenta l concept in  terms of quantum fields. In this construction of matter, ther­ modynamic concepts (irreversibili ty, entropy) have a role to  play.  Let us summarize what has been achieved here. The central  role of the second law (and of the correlative concept of irre­ versibility) at the level of macroscopic systems has already  been emphasized in Books One and 1\vo.  What we have tried to show in Book Three is that we now  can go beyond the macroscopic level, and discover the micro­ scopic meaning of irreversibility.  However , this requires basic changes in the way in which we </p><div id="pagenum"><p>321</p></div><p id="page">289 IRREVERSIBIL ITY-THE ENTROPY BARRIER  conceive the fundamental laws of physics. It is only when the  classical point of view is lost-as it is in the case of sufficiently  unstable systems-that we can speak of 'intrinsic random­ ness' and 'intrinsic irreversibility.'  It is for such systems tha t we may introduce a new enlarged  description of time in terms of the operator time T. As we have  shown in the example of the Baker transformation (Chapter IX  "From randomness to irreversibility" ), this operator has as  eigenfunctions partitions of the phase space (see Figure 39).  We come therefore to a situation quite reminiscent of that of  quantum mechanic s. We have indeed two possible descrip­ tions. Either we give ourselves a point in phase space, and  then we don't know to which partition it belongs, and there­ fore we don't know its internal age; or we know its internal  age, but then we know only the partition , but not the exact  localization of the point.  Once we have introduced the internal time T, we can use  entropy as a selection principle to go from the initial descrip­ tion in terms of the distribution function p to a new one, p  where the distribution p has an intrinsic arrow of time, satisfy­ ing the second law of thermodyna mics. The basic difference  between p and p appears when these functions are expanded in  terms of the eigenfunction of the operator time T (see Chapter  VII, "The rise of quantum mechanics"). In p, all internal ages,  be they from past or future, appear symmetrically . In contrast ,  in p, past and future play different roles. The past is included,  but the future remains uncertain. That is the meaning of the  arrow of time. The fascinating aspect is that there appears now  a relation betw�en initial conditions and the laws of change. A  state with an arrow of time emerges from a law, which has also  an arrow of time, and which transforms the state, however  keeping this arrow of time.  We have concentr ated mostly on the classical situation.2o  However, our analysis applies as well to quantum mechanics,  where the situation is more complica ted, as the existence of  Planck's constant destroys already the concept of a trajectory,  and leads therefore also to a kind of delocalization in phase  space. In quantum mechanics we have therefore to superpose  the quantum delocalization with de localization due to irrevers­ ibility.  As emphasized in Chapter VII, the two great revolutions in </p><div id="pagenum"><p>322</p></div><p id="page">ORDER OUT OF CHAOS 290  the physics of our century correspond to the incorporation, in  the fundamental structur e of physics, of impossibilities foreign  to classical mechanics: the impossibility of signals pro pagating  with a velocity larger than the velocity of light, and the impos­ sibility of measuring simultaneously coordinates and momen­ tum.  It is not astonishing that the second principle, which as well  limits our abili ty to manipula te matter, also leads to deep  changes in the structur e of the basic laws of physics.  Let us conclude this part of our monograph with a word of  caution. The phenomenol ogical theory of irreversible pro­ cesses is at present well established. In contrast, the basic mi­ croscopic theory of irreversible processes is quite new. At the  time of correcting the proofs of this book, experiments are in  preparation to test these views. As long as they have not been  performed, a speculative element is unavoidable. </p><div id="pagenum"><p>323</p></div><p id="page">CONCL USION  FROM EARTH TO HEAVEN­ THE REENCHANTMENT  OF NATURE  In any attempt to bridge the domains of experience belonging  to the spiritual and physical s1des of our nature, time occupies  the key position.  A. S. EDDINGT ON1  An Open Science  Science certainly involves manipulating nature, but it is also  an attempt to understand it, to dig deeper into questions that  have been asked generation after generation. One of these ques­ tions runs like a leitmotiv, almost as an obsession, through this  book, as it does through the history of science and philosophy .  This is the question of the relation between being and becom­ ing, between permanence and change.  We have mentioned pre-Socr atic speculations: Is change,  whereby things are born and die, imposed from the outside on  some kind of inert matter? Or is it the result of the intrinsic and  independent activity of matter? Is an external driving force  necessa ry, or is becoming inherent in matter? Seventeenth­ century science arose in opposition to the biological model of  a spontaneous and autonomous organiza tion of natural beings.  But it was confronted with another fundamental alternative. Is  nature intrinsically random? Is ordered behavior merely the  transient result of the chance collisions of atoms and of their  unstable association s?  One of the main sources of fascina tion in modern science  was precisely the feeling that it had discovered eternal laws at  291 </p><div id="pagenum"><p>324</p></div><p id="page">ORDER OUT OF CHAOS 292  the core of nature's transformations and thus had exorcised  time and becomin g. This discovery of an order in nature pro­ duced the feeling of intellectual security described by French  sociologist Levy-Bruhl:  Our feeling of intellectu al security is so deeply anchored  in us that we even do not see how it could be shaken.  Even if we suppose that we could observe some phenom­ enon seemingly quite mysterious, we still would remain  persuaded that our ignorance is only provisional, that this  phenomenon must satisfy the general laws of causality,  and that the reasons for which it has appeared will be  determined sooner or later. Nature around us is order  and reason, exactly as is the human mind. Our everyday  activity implies a perfect confidence in the universality of  the laws of nature.2  This feeling of confidence in the "reason" of nature has  been shattered, partly as the result of the tumultuous growth  of science in our time. As we stated in the Preface, our vision  of nature is undergoing a radical change toward the multiple,  the temporal, and the complex. Some of these changes have  been described in this book.  We were seeking general, all-embracing schemes that could  be expressed in terms of eternal laws, but we have found time,  events, evolving particles. We were also searching for sym­ metry, and here also we were surpr ised, since we discovered  symmetry-breaking processes on all levels, from elementary  particles up to biology and ecology. We have described in this  book the clash between dynamics, with the temporal symme­ try it implies, and the second law of thermodynamic s, with its  directed time.  A new unity is emerging: irreversibility is a source of order  at all levels. Irreversibility is the mechanism that brings order  out of chaos. How could such a radical transformation of our  views on nature occur in the relatively short time span of the  past few decades? We believe that it shows the important role  intellectual construction plays in our concept of reality. This  was very well expressed by Bohr, when he said to Werner Hei­ senberg on the occasion of a visit at Kronberg Castle: </p><div id="pagenum"><p>325</p></div><p id="page">293 .

Einstein emphasized that science had to be independent of the  existence of any observer. This led him to deny the reality of  time as irreversibility, as evolution. On the contrary, Thgore  maintained that even if absolute truth could exist, it would be  inaccessible to the human mind. Curiously enough, the pres­ ent evolution of science is running in the direction stated by  the great Indian poet. Whateve r we call reality, it is revealed to  us only through the active construction in which we partici­ pate. As it is concisely expressed by D. S. Kothari, "The sim­ ple fact is that no measurement, no experiment or observation  is possible without a relevant theoretical framework. "5  Time and Times  The statement that time is basically a geometric parameter  that makes it possible to follow the unfolding of the succession  of dynamical states has been asserted in physics for more than  three centuries. Emile Meyerson6 tried to describe the history  of modern science as the gradual implementation of what he  regarded as a basic category of human reason: the different  and the changing had to be reduced to the identical and the  permanent. Time had to be eliminated. </p><div id="pagenum"><p>326</p></div><p id="page">ORDER OUT OF CHAOS 294  Nearer to our own time, Einstein appears as the incarnation  of this drive toward a formulation of physics in which no refer­ ence to irreversibility would be made on the fundamental level.  An histo ric scene took place at the Societe de Philosophie in  Paris on April6, 1922,1 when Henri Bergson attempted to de­ fend the cause of the multiplicity of coexisting "lived" times  against Einstein. Einstein's reply was absolute: he categori­ cally rejected "philosophers' time." Lived experience cannot  save what has been denied by science.  Einstein's reaction was somewhat justified. Bergson had ob­ viously misunderstood Einstein's theory of relativity. How­ ever, there also was some prejudice on Einstein's part: duree,  Bergson's "lived time," refers to the basic dimensions of be­ coming, the irreversibility that Einstein was willing to admit  only at the phenom enological level. We have already referred  to Einstein's conversations with Carnap (see Chapter VII).  For him distinctions among past, present, and future were out­ side the scope of physics.  It is fascinating to follow the correspondence between Ein­ stein and the closest friend of his young days in Zurich, Michele  Besso. 8 Although he was an engineer and scientist, toward the  end of his life Besso became increasingly concerned with phi­ losophy, literature, and the problems that surround the core of  human existence. Untiringly he kept asking the same ques­ tions: What is irreversibility? What is its relationship with the  laws of physics? And untiringly Einstein would answer with a  patience he showed only to this closest friend: irreversibility is  merely an illusion produced by "improbable" initial conditio ns.  This dialogue continued over many years until Besso, older  than Einstein by eight years, passed away, only a few months  before Einstein's death. In a last letter to Besso's sister and  son, Einstein wrote: "Michele has left this strange world just  before me. This is of no importance. For us convinced physi­ cists the distinction between past, present and future is an illu­ sion, although a persistent one." In Einstein's drive to perceive  the basic laws of physics, the intelligible was identified with  the immutab le.  Why was Einstein so strongly opposed to the introduction  of irreversibility into physics? We can only guess. Einstein  was a rather lonely man; he had few friends, few cowork ers, </p><div id="pagenum"><p>327</p></div><p id="page">295 FROM EARTH TO HEAVEN- THE REENCHANTMENT OF NATURE  few students. He lived in a sad time: the two World Wars, the  rise of anti-Semitism. It is not surprising that for Einstein sci­ ence was the road that led to victory over the turmoil of time.  What a contrast, however, with his scientific work. His world  was full of observers, of scientists situated in various coordi­ nate systems in motion with one another, situated on various  stars differing by their gravitational fields. All these observers  were exchanging information through signals all over the uni­ verse. What Einstein wanted to preserve above all was the ob­ jective meaning of this communica tion. However , we can  perhaps state that Einstein stopped short of accepting that  communication and irreversibility are closely related. Com­ munication is at the base of what probably is the· most irrevers­ ible process accessible to the human mind, the progressive  increase of knowledge .  The Entropy Barrier  In Chapter IX we described the second law as a selection prin­ ciple: to each initial condition there corresponds an "informa­ tion." All initial conditions for which this information is finite  are permitte d. Howeve r, to reverse the direction of time we  would need infinite information; we cannot produce situations  that would evolve into our past! This is the entropy barrier we  have introduced.  There is an interesting analogy with the concept of the ve­ locity of light as the maximum velocity of transmission of sig­ nals. As we have seen in Chapter VII, this is one of the basic  postulates of Einstein' s relativity theory. The existence of the  velocity of light barrier is necessary to give meaning to causal­ ity. Suppose we could, in a science-fiction ship, leave the earth at  a velocity greater than the velocity of light. We could overtake  light signals and in this way precede our own past. Likewise,  the entropy barrier is necessary to give meaning to communi­ cation. We have already mentioned that irreversibility and  communication are closely related. Norbert Wiener has ar­ gued that the existence of two directions of time would have  disastrous consequences. It is worthwhile to cite a passage  from his well-known book Cybernetics: </p><div id="pagenum"><p>328</p></div><p id="page">ORDER OUT OF CHAOS 296  Indeed, it is a very interesting intellectual experiment  to make the fantasy of an intelligent being whose time  should run the other way to our own. To such a being, all  communication with us would be impossible. Any signal  he might send would reach us with a logical stream of  consequents from his point of view, antecedents from  ours. These antecedents would already be in our experi­ ence, and would have served to us as the natural explana­ tion of his signal, without presupposing an intelligent  being to have sent it. If he drew us a square, we should  see the remains of his figure as its precursors, and it would  seem to be the curious crystallization -always perfectly  explainable -of these remains. Its meaning would seem  to be as fortuitous as the faces we read into mountains  and cliffs. The drawing of the square would appear to us  as a catastrophe-sudden indeed, but explainable by nat­ ural laws-by which that square wo_Id cease to exist.  Our counterpart would have exactly similar ideas con­ cerning us. Within any world with which we can commu­ nicate, the direction of time is uniform.9  It is precisely the infinite entropy barrier that guarantees the  uniqueness of the direction of time, the impossibility of switching  from one direction of time to the opposite one.  In the course of this book, we have stressed the importance  of demonstrations of impossibi lity. In fact, Einstein was the  first to grasp that importance when he based his concept of rela­ tive simultaneity on the impossibility of transmitting informa­ tion at a velocity greater than that of light. The whole theory of  relativity is built around the exclusion of "unobser vable" simul­ taneities. Einstein considered this step as somewhat similar to  the step taken in thermodynamics when perpetual motion was  excluded. But some of his contemporaries-Heisenberg, for  example-emphasized an important difference between these  two impossibilities. In the case of thermodynamics, a certain  situation is defined as being absent from nature; in the case of  relativity, it is an observation that is defined as impossible­ that is, a type of dialogue, of communication between nature  and the person who describes it. Thus Heisenberg saw himself  as following Einstein's example, in spite of Einstein's skepti­ cism, when he grounded quantum mechanics on the ex.clusion </p><div id="pagenum"><p>329</p></div><p id="page">297 FROM EARTH TO HEAVEN- THE REENCHANTMENT OF NATURE  of what the quantum uncertainty principle defines as unobser ­ vable.  As long as the second law was considered to express only a  practical improbability , it had little theoretical interest. You  could always hope to overcome it by sufficient technical skill.  But we have seen that this is not so. At its roots there is a  selection of possible initial states. It is only after these states  have been selected that the probability interpretation becomes  possible. Indeed, as Boltzmann stated for the first time, the  increase of entropy expresses the increase of probability, of  disorder. However , his interpretation results from the con­ clusion that entropy is a selection principle breaking the time  symmetry. It is only after this symmetry-breaking that any  probabilistic interpretation becomes possible.  In spite of the fact that we have recouped much of Boltz­ mann's interpretation of entropy, the basis of our interpreta­ tion of his second law is radically different, since we have in  succession  the second law as a symmetry-breaking selection principle  �  probabilistic interpretation  �  irreversibility as increase of disorder  It is only the unification of dynamics and thermodynamics  through the introduction of a new selection principle that gives  the second law its fundamental importance as the evolutionary  paradigm of the sciences. This point is of such importance that  we shall dwell on it in more detail.  The Evolutionary Paradigm  f  The world of dynamics, be it classical or quantum, is a re- versible world. As we have emphasized in Chapter VIII, no  evolution can be ascribed to this world; the "information" ex­ pressed in terms of dynamical units remains constant. It is  therefore of great importance that the existence of an evolu­ tionary paradigm can now be established in physics-not only </p><div id="pagenum"><p>330</p></div><p id="page">ORDER OUT OF CHAOS 298  on the level of macroscopic description but also on all levels.  Of course, there are conditions: as we have seen, a minimum  complexity is necessary. But the immense importance of irre­ versible processes shows that this requirement is satisfied for  most systems of interest. Remarkably, the perception of ori­ ented time increases as the level of biological organization in­ creases and probably reaches its culmina ting point in human  consciousness.  How general is this evolutionary paradigm? It includes iso­ lated systems that evolve to disorder and open systems that  evolve to higher and higher forms of complexity . It is not sur­ prising that the entropy metaphor has tempted a number of  writers dealing with social or economic problems. Obviously  here we have to be careful; human beings are not dynamic  objects, and the transition to thermodynamics cannot be for­ mulated as a selection principle maintained by dynamics. On  the human level irreversibility is a more fundamental concept,  which is for us inseparable from the meaning of our existenc e.  Still it is essential that in this perspective we no longer see the  internal feeling of irreversibility as a subjective impression that  alienates us from the outside world, but as marking our partic­ ipation in a world dominated by an evolutionary paradigm.  Cosmological problems are notoriously difficult. We still do  not know what the role of gravitation was in the early universe .  Can gravitation be included in some form of the second law, or  is there a kind of dialectical balance between thermodynamics  and gravitation? Certainly irreversibility could not have ap­ peared abruptly in a time-reversible world. The origin of irre­ versibility is a cosmological problem and would require an  analysis of the universe in its first stages. Her e our aim is more  modest. What does irreversibility mean today? How does it  relate to our position in the world we describe?  Actors and Spectators  The denial of becoming by physics created deep rifts within  science and estranged science from philosophy . What had  originally been a daring wager with the dominant Aristotelian </p><div id="pagenum"><p>331</p></div><p id="page">299 FROM EARTH TO HEAVEN-THE REENCHANTMENT OF NATURE  tradition gradually became a dogmatic assertion directed  against all those (chemists, biologists, physicians) for whom a  qualitative diversity existed in nature. At the end of the nine­ teenth century this conflict had shifted from inside science to  the relation between "science" and the rest of culture, es­ pecially philosop hy. We have described in Chapter III this as­ pect of the history of Western thought, with its continual  struggle to achieve a new unity of knowledge. The "lived  time" of the phenomenologists, the Lebenswelt opposed to  the objective world of science, may be related to the need to  erect bulwarks against the invasion of science.  Today we believe that the epoch of certainties and absolute  oppositions is over. Physicists have no privilege whatsoever to  any kind of extraterritor iality. As scientists they belong to  their culture, to which, in their turn, they make an essential  contribution. We have reached a situation close to the one rec­ ognized long ago in sociology: Merleau-Ponty had already  stressed the need to keep in mind what he termed a "truth  within situations. "  So long as I keep before me the ideal of an absolute ob­ server, of knowledge in the absence of any viewpoint, I  can only see my situation as being a source of error. But  once I have acknowledged that through it I am geared to  all actions and all knowledge that are meaningful to me,  and that it is gradually filled with everything that may be  for me, then my contact with the social in the finitude of  my situation is revealed to me as the starting point of all  truth, including that of science and, since we have some  idea of the truth, since we are inside truth and cannot get  outside it, all that I can do is define a truth within the  situation. 10  It is this conception of knowledge as both objective and par­ ticipatory that we have explored through this book.  In his Themesll Merleau-Ponty also asserted that the "phil­ osophic" discoveries of science, its basic conceptual transfor­ mations, are often the result of negative discoveries. which  provide the occasion and the starting point for a reversal of  point of view. Demonstrations of impossibility, whether in rel-</p><div id="pagenum"><p>332</p></div><p id="page">ORDER OUT OF CHAOS 300  ativity, quantum mechanic s, or thermodynam ics, have shown  us that nature cannot be described "from the outside," as if by  a spectator. Description is dialogue, communi cation, and this  communic ation is subject to constraints that demonstr ate that  we are macroscopic beings embedded in the physical world.  We may summarize the situation as we see it today in the  following diagram:  observer -----+  t  dissipative structures  t dynamics  I  irreversibility +-randomness +-unstable dynamic systems  We start from the observer, who measures coordinates and  momenta and studies their change in time. This leads him to  the discovery of unstable dynamic systems and other concepts  of intrinsic randomness and intrinsic irreversibility , as we dis­ cussed them in Chapter IX. Once we have intrinsic irrevers­ ibility and entropy, we come in far-from-equilibrium systems  to dissipative structur es, and we can understand the time­ oriented activity of the observer.  There is no scientific activity that is not time-oriented. The  preparation of an experiment calls for a distinction between  "before .. and "after ... It is only because we are aware of irre­ versibility that we can recognize reversible motion. Our dia­ gram shows that we have now come full circle, that we can see  ourselves as part of the universe we describe.  The scheme we have presented is not an a priori scheme­ deducible from some logical structure. There is, indeed, no  logical necessity for dissipative structures actually to exist in  nature; the "cosmological fact" of a universe far from equilib­ rium is needed for the macroscopic world to be a world inhabited  by "observers"-that is, to be a living world. Our scheme thus  does not correspond to a logical or epistemolo gical truth but  refers to our condition as macroscopic beings in a world far  from equilibrium. Moreover, an essential characteristic of our  scheme is that it does not suppose any fundamental mode of  description ; each level of description is implied by another and  implies the other. We need a multiplicity of levels that are all  connected, none of which may have a claim to preeminence. </p><div id="pagenum"><p>333</p></div><p id="page">301 FROM EARTH TO HEAVEN- THE REENCHANTMENT OF NATURE  We have already emphasized that irreversibility is not a uni­ versal phenomenon. We can perform experiments correspond­ ing to thermodynamic equilibrium in limited portions of space.  Moreover , the importance of time scales varies. A stone  evolves according to the time scale of geological evolution;  human societies, especially in our time, obviously have a  much shorter time scale. We have already mentioned that irre­ versibility starts with a minimum complexity of the dynamic  systems involved. It is interesting that with an increase of  complexity , going from the stone to human societies, the role  of the arrow of time, of evolutionary rhythms, increases. Mo­ lecular biology shows that everything in a cell is not alive in  the same way. Some processes reach equilibrium, others are  dominated by regulatory enzymes far from equilibrium. Sim­ ilarly, the arrow of time plays quite different roles in the uni­ verse around us. From this point of view, in the sense of this  time-oriented activity, the human condition seems unique. It  seems to us, as we said in Chapter IX, quite important that  irreversibili ty, the arrow of time, implies randomness. "Time  is constructi on." This conclusion, one that Valery 12 reached  quite independently , carries a message that goes beyond sci­ ence proper.  A Whirlwind in a Turbulent Nature  In our society, with its wide spectrum of cognitive techniques,  science occupies a peculiar position, that of a poetical inter­ rogation of nature, in the etymological sense that the poet is a  "maker"-active, manipulating, and exploring. Moreover , sci­ ence is now capable of respecting the nature it investigates.  Out of the dialogue with nature initiated by classical science,  with its view of nature as an automaton, has grown a quite  different view in which the activity of questioning nature is  part of its intrinsic activity.  As we have written at the start of this chapter , our feeling of  intellectual security has been shattered. We can now appreci­ ate in a nonpolemical fashion the relation between science and  philosophy . We have already mentioned the Einstein-Bergson  conflict. Bergson was certainly "wrong" on some technical  points, but his task as a philosopher was to attempt to make </p><div id="pagenum"><p>334</p></div><p id="page">ORDER OUT OF CHAOS 302  explicit inside physics the aspects of time he thought science  was neglecting.  Exploring the implications and the coherence of those funda­ mental concepts, which appear both scientific and philosoph­ ical, may be risky, but it can be very fruitful in the dialogue  between science and philosop hy. Let us illustrate this with  some brief references to Leibniz, Peirce, Whitehead, and Lu­ cretius.  Leibniz introduced the strange concept of monads, non­ communicating physical entities that have "no windows through  which something can get in or out. " His views have often been  dismissed as mad, and still, as we have seen in Chapter 11, it is  an essential property of all integrable systems that there exist  a transformation that may be described in terms of nonin­ teracting entities. These entities translate their own initial  state throughout their motion, but at the same time, like mon­ ads, they coexist with all the others in a "preestabl ished" har­ mony: in this representation, the state of each entity, although  perfectly self-determined, reflects the state of the whole sys­ tem down to the smallest detail.  All integrable systems thus can be viewed as "monadic" sys­ tems. Converse ly, Leibnizian monadology can be translated into  dynamic language: the universe is an integrable system.13  Monadology thus becomes the most consequential formula­ tion of a universe from which all becoming is eliminated. By  considering Leibniz's efforts to understand the activity of mat­ ter, we can measure the gap that separates the seventeenth  century from our time. The tools were not yet ready; it was  impossible, on the basis of a purely mechanical universe, for  Leibniz to give an account of the activity of matter. Still some  of his ideas, that substance is activity, that the universe is an  interrelated unit, remain with us and are today taking on a new  form.  We regret that we cannot devote sufficient space to the work  of Charles S. Peirce. At least let us cite one remarkable pas­ sage:  You have all heard of the dissipation of energy. It is found  that in all transfor mations of energy a part is converted  into heat and heat is always tending to equalize its tem-</p><div id="pagenum"><p>335</p></div><p id="page">303 FROM EARTH TO HEAVEN- THE REENCHANTMENT OF NATURE  perature. The consequence is that the energy of the uni­ verse is tending by virtue of its necessary laws toward a  death of the universe in which there shall be no force but  heat and the temperature everywhere the same ....  But although no force can counteract this tendency ,  chance may and will have the opposite influence. Force is  in the long run dissipative; chance is in the long run con­ centrative. The dissipation of energy by the regular laws  of nature is by these very laws accompanied by circum­ stances more and more favorable to its reconcentration  by chance. There must therefore be a point at which the  two tendencies are balanced and that is no doubt the ac­ tual condition of the whole universe at the present time.J4  Once again, Peirce's metaphysics was considered as one more  example of a philosophy alienated from reality. But, in fact,  today Peirce's work appears to be a pioneering step toward the  understanding of the pluralism involved in physical laws.  Whitehead's philosophy takes us to the other end of the spec­ trum. For him, being is inseparable from becoming. Whitehead  wrote: "The elucidation of the meaning of the sentence 'every­ thing flows' is one of metaphys ics' main tasks." 15 Physics and  metaphysics are indeed coming together today in a conception  of the world in which process, becoming, is taken as a primary  constituent of physical existence and where, unlike Leibniz'  monads, existing entities can interact and therefore also be  born and die.  The ordered world of classical physics, or a monadic theory  of parallel changes, resembles the equally parallel, ordered,  and eternal fall of Lucretius' atoms through infinite space. We  have already mentioned the clinamen and the instability of  laminar flows. But we can go farther. As Serresi6 points out,  the infinite fall provides a model on which to base our con­ ception of the natural genesis of the disturbance that causes  things to be born. If the vertical fall were not disturbed "with­ out reason" by the clinamen, which leads to encounters and  associations between uniformly falling atoms, no nature could  be created; all that would be reproduced would be the repeti­ tive connection between equivalent causes and effects gov­ erned by the laws of fate (foedera fati). </p><div id="pagenum"><p>336</p></div><p id="page">ORDER OUT OF CHAOS 304  Denique si semper motus conectitur omnls  et uetere exoritur [semper] novus ordine certo  nee declinando faciunt primordia motus  principium quoddam quod fatl foedera rumpat,  ex lnfinito ne causa m causa sequatur,  libera per terras unde haec animantibus exstat ... ?17  Lucretius may be said to have invented the clinamen in the  same way that archaeological remains are "invented": one  "guesses" they are there before one begins to dig. If only uni­ formly reversible trajectories existed, where would the irre­ versible processes we produce and experience come from?  The point where the trajectories cease to be determined,  where thefoederafati governing the ordered and monotonous  world of deterministic change break down, marks the begin­ ning of nature. It also marks the beginning of a new science  that describes the birth, proliferation, and death of natural  beings. "The physics of falling, of repetition, of rigorous con­ catenation is replaced by the creative science of change and  circumstances. "18 The foedera fati are replaced by the  foedera naturae , which, as Serres emphasizes, denote both  "laws" of nature-local, singular, historical relations-and an  "allianc e," a form of contract with nature.  In Lucretian physics we thus again find the link we have  discovered in modern knowledge between the choices under­ lying a physical description and a philosophic, ethical, or re­ ligious conception relating to man's situation in nature. The  physics of universal connections is set against another science  that in the name of law and domination no longer struggles  with disturbance or randomness. Classical science from Ar­ chime des to Clausius was opposed to the science of turbu­ lence and of bifurcating changes.  It is here that Greek wisdom reaches one of its pinnacles.  Where man is in the world, of the world, in matter, of  matter, he is not a strange r, but a friend, a member of the  family, and an equal. He has made a pact with things.  Converse ly, many other systems and many other sci­ ences are based on breaking this pact. Man is a stranger  to the world, to the dawn, to the sky, to things. He hates </p><div id="pagenum"><p>337</p></div><p id="page">305 FROM EARTH TO HEAVEN- THE REENCHANTMEN T OF NATURE  them, and fights them. His environment is a dangerous  enemy to be fought, to be kept enslaved ..•. Epicurus  and Lucretius live in a reconciled universe. Where the  science of things and the science of man coincide. I am a  disturbance, a whirlwind in turbulent nature.1�  Beyond Tautology  The world of classical science was a world in which the only  events that could occur were those deducible from the in­ stantaneous state of the system. Curiously , this conception,  which we have traced back to Galileo and Newton, was not  new at that time. Indeed, it can be identified with Aristotle's  conception of a divine and immutable heaven. In Aristotle's  opinion, it was only the heavenly world to which we could  hope to apply an exact mathematical description. In the Intro­ duction, we echoed the complaint that science has "disen­ chanted" the world. But this disenchantment is paradoxically  due to the glorification of the earthly world, henceforth  worthy of the kind of intellectual pursuit Aristotle reserved for  heaven. Classical science denied becoming, natural diversity,  both considered by Aristotle as attributes of the sublunar , in­ ferior world. In this sense, classical science brought heaven to  earth. However , this apparently was not the intention of the  fathers of modern science. In challenging Aristotle's claim that  mathematics ends where nature begins, they did not seek to  discover the immutable concealed behind the changing, but  rather to extend changing, corruptible nature to the bound­ aries of the universe. In his Dialogue Concerning the Two  Chief World Systems, Galileo is amazed at the notion that the  world would be a nobler place if the great flood had left only a  sea of ice behind, or if the earth had the incorruptible hard­ ness of jasper; let those who think the earth would be more  beautiful after being changed into a crystal ball be trans­ formed by Medusa's stare into a diamond statue!  But the objects chosen by the first physicists to explore the  validity of a quantitative description-that is, the ideal pendu­ lum with its conservative motion, simple machines, planetary  orbits, etc.-were found to correspond to a unique mathemati-</p><div id="pagenum"><p>338</p></div><p id="page">ORDER OUT OF CHAOS 306  cal description that actually reproduced the divine ideality of  Aristotle's heavenly bodies.  Like Aristotle's gods, the objects of classical dynamics are  concerned only with themselves. They can learn nothing from  the outside. At any instant, each point in the system knows all  it will ever need to know-that is, the distribution of masses in  space and their velocities. Each state contains the whole truth  concerning all possible other states, and each can be used to  predict the others, whatever their respective positions on the  time axis. In this sense, this description leads to a tautology ,  since both future and past are contained in the present.  The radical change in the outlook of modern science, the  transition toward the temporal, the multiple, may be viewed as  the reversal of the movement that brought Aristotle's heaven to  earth. Now we are bringing earth to heaven. We are discover­ ing the primacy of time and change, from the level of elemen­ tary particles to cosmological models.  Both at the macroscopic and microscopic levels, the natural  sciences have thus rid themselves of a conception of objective  reality that implied that novelty and diversity had to be denied  in the name of immutable universal laws. They have rid them­ selves of a fascination with a rationality taken as closed and a  knowledge seen as nearly achieved. They are now open to the  unexpected, which they no longer define as the result of imper- fect knowledge or insufficient control. ·  This opening up of science has been well defined by Serge  Moscovici as the "Keplerian revolution," to distinguish it  from the "Copernican revolution" in which the idea of an ab­ solute point of view was maintained. In many of the passages  cited in the Introduction to this book, science was likened to a  "disenchantment" of the world. Let us quote Moscovici's de­ scription of the changes going on in the sciences today:  Science has become involved in this adventure, our ad­ venture, in order to renew everything it touches and  warm all that it penetrates-the earth on which we live  and the truths which enable us to live. At each turn it is  not the echo of a demise, a bell tolling for a passing away  that is heard, but the voice of rebirth and beginning, ever  afresh, of mankind and materiali ty, fixed for an instant in  their ephemeral permanence. That is why the great dis-</p><div id="pagenum"><p>339</p></div><p id="page">307 FROM EARTH TO HEAVEN- THE REENCHA NTMENT OF NATURE  coveries are not revealed on a deathbed like that of  Copernicus, but offered like Kepler's on the road of  dreams and passion.2o  The Creative Course of Time  It is often said that without Bach we would not have had the  "St. Matthew Passion" but that relativity would have been dis­ covered without Einstein. Science is supposed to take a deter­ ministic course, in contrast with the unpredictability involved  in the history of the arts. When we look back on the strange  history of science, three centuries of which we have tried to  outline, we may doubt the validity of such assertions. There  are striking examples of facts that have been ignored because  the cultural climate was not ready to incorporate them into a  consistent scheme. The discovery of chemical clocks probably  goes back to the nineteenth century , but their result seemed to  contradict the idea of uniform decay to equilibrium. Mete­ orites were thrown out of the Vienna museum because there  was no place for them in the description of the solar system.  Our cultural environment plays an active role in the questions  we ask, but beyond matters of style and social acceptance, we  can identify a number of questions to which each generation  returns.  The question of time is certainly one of those questions.  Here we disagree somewhat with Thomas Kuhn's analysis of  the formation of "normal" science.21 Scientific activity best  corresponds to Kuhn's view when it is considered in the con­ text of the contemporary universi ty, in which research and the  training of future researchers is combined. Kuhn's analysis, if  it is taken as a description of science in general, leading to  conclusions about what knowledge must be, can be reduced to  a new psychosocial version of the positivist conception of sci­ entific development, namely , the tendency to increasing spe­ cialization and compar tmentalization; the identification of  "normal" scientific behavior with.that of the "serious," "si­ lent" researcher who wastes no time on "general" questions  about the overall significance of his research but sticks to spe­ cialized problems; and the essential independence of scientific  development from cultural, economic, and social problems. </p><div id="pagenum"><p>340</p></div><p id="page">ORDER OUT OF CHAOS 306  The academic structure in which the "normal science" de·  scribed by Kuhn came into being took shape in the nineteenth  century. Kuhn emphasizes that it is by repeating in the form of  exercises solutions to the paradigmatic problems of previous  generations that students learn the concepts upon which re­ search is based. It is in this way that they are given the criteria  that define a problem as interesting and a solution as accept­ able. The transition from student to researcher takes place  gradually; the scientist continues to solve problems using sim­ ilar techniques.  Even in our time, for which Kuhn's description has the  greatest relevance, it refers to only one specific aspect of sci­ entific activity . The importance of this aspect varies according  to the individual researchers and the institutional context.  In Kuhn's view the transformation of a paradigm appears as  a crisis: instead of remaining a silent, almost invisible rule,  instead of remaining unspoken, the paradigm is actually ques­ tioned. Instead of working in unison, the members of the com­ munity begin to ask "basic" questions and challenge the  legitimacy of their methods. The group, which by training was  homogeneous, now diversifies. Different points of view, cul­ tural exper.iences, and philosophic convictions are now ex­ pressed and often play a decisive role in the discovery of a new  paradigm. The emergence of the new paradigm further in­ creases the vehemence of the debate. The rival paradigms are  put to the test until the academic world determines the victor.  With the appearance of a new generation of scientists, silence  and unanimity take over again. New textbooks are written,  and once again things "go without saying."  In this view the driving force behind scientific innovation is  the intensely conservative behavior of scientific communities,  which stubbornly apply to nature the same techniques, the  same concepts, and always end up by encountering an equally  stubborn resistance from nature. When nature is eventually  seen as refusing to express itself in the accepted language, the  crisis explodes with the kind of violence that results from a  breach of confidence. At this stage, all intellectual resources  are concentrated on the search for a new language. Thus sci­ entists have to deal with crises imposed upon them against  their will.  The questions we have investigated have led us to emphasize </p><div id="pagenum"><p>341</p></div><p id="page">309 FROM EARTH TO HEAVEN- THE REENCHANTMENT OF NATURE  aspects that differ considerably from those to which Kuhn's  description applies. We have dwelled on continuities, not the  "obvious" continuities but the hidden ones, those involving  difficult questions rejected by many as illegitimate or false but  that keep coming back generation after generation -questions  such as the dynamics of complex systems, the relation of the  irreversible world of chemistry and biology with the reversible  description provided by classical physics. In fact, the interest  of such questions is hardly surprising. To us, the problem is  rather to understand how they could ever have been neglected  after the work of Diderot, Stahl, Venel, and others.  The past one hundred years have been marked by several  crises that correspond closely to the description given by  Kuhn-none of which were sought by scientists. Examples  are the discovery of the instability of elementary particles, or  of the evolving universe. However , the recent history of sci­ ence is also characterized by a series of problems that are the  consequences of deliberate and lucid questions asked by sci­ entists who knew that the questions had both scientific and  philosophical aspects. Thus scientists are not doomed to be­ have like "hypnons"!  It is important to point out that the new scientific develop­ ment we have described, the incorporation of irreversibility  into physics, is not to be seen as some kind of "revelation,"  the possession of which would set its possessor apart from the  cultural world he lives in. On the contrary , this development  clearly reflects both the internal logic of science and the  cultural and social context of our time.  In particular, how can we consider as accidental that the  rediscovery of time in physics is occurring at a time of extreme  acceleration in human history? Cultural context cannot be the  complete answer, but it cannot be denied either. We have to  incorporate the complex relations between "internal" and  "external" determinations of the production of scientific con­ cepts.  In the preface of this book, we have emphasized that its  French title (La nouvelle alliance) expresses the coming to­ gether of the "two cultures". Perhaps the confluence is no­ where as clear as in the problem of the microscopic  foundations of irreversibility we have studied in Book Three.  As mentioned repeate dly, both classical and quantum me-</p><div id="pagenum"><p>342</p></div><p id="page">ORDER OUT OF CHAOS 310  chanics are based on arbitrary initial conditions and deter­ ministic laws (for trajectories or wave functions). In a sense,  laws made simply explicit what was already present in the ini­ tial conditions. This is no longer the case when irreversibilty is  taken into account. In this perspective, initial conditions arise  from previous evolution and are transformed into states of the  same class through subsequent evolution.  We come therefore close to the central problem of Western  ontology: the relation between Being and Becoming. We have  given a brief account of the problem in Chapter III. It is  remarkable that two of the most influential works of the cen­ tury were precisely devoted to this problem. We have in mind  Whitehead's Process and Reality and Heidegger's Sein und  Zeit. In both cases, the aim is to go beyond the identification  of Being with timelessness, following the Voie Royale of west­ ern philosophy since Plato and Aristotle.22  But obvious ly, we cannot reduce Being to Time, and we  cannot deal with a Being devoid of any temporal connotation.  The direction which the microscopic theory of irreversibility  takes gives a new content to the speculations of Whitehead  and Heidegger .  It would go beyond the aim of this book to develop this prob­ lem in greater detail; we hope to do it elsewhere. Let us notice  that initial conditions, as summarized in a state of the system,  are associated with Being; in contrast, the laws involving tem­ poral changes are associated with Becoming.  In our view, Being and Becoming are not to be opposed one  to the other: they express two related aspects of reality.  A state with broken time symmetry arises from a law with  broken time symmetry , which propagates it into a state be­ longing to the same category .  In a recent monograph (From Being to Becoming), one of  the authors concluded in the following terms: "For most of the  founders of classical science-even for Einstein-science was  an attempt to go beyond the world of appearances, to reach a  timeless world of supreme rationality-the world of Spinoza.  But perhaps there is a more subtle form of reality that involves  both laws and games, time and eternity. "  This is precisely the direction which the microscopic theory  of irreversible processes is taking. </p><div id="pagenum"><p>343</p></div><p id="page">311 FROM EARTH TO HEAVEN- THE REENCHA NTMENT OF NATURE  The Human Condition  We agree completely with Herman Weyl:  Scientists would be wrong to ignore the fact that theo­ retical construction is not the only approach to the phe­ nomena of life; another way, that of understanding from  within (interpretation), is open to us .... Of myself, of  my own acts of perception, thought, volition, feeling and  doing, I have a direct knowledge entirely different from  the theoretical knowledge that represents the "parallel"  cerebral processes. in symbols. This inner awareness of  myself is the basis for the understanding of my fellow­ men whom I meet and acknowledge as beings of my own  kind, with whom I communicate sometimes so intimately  as to share joy and sorrow with them.23  Until recently , however , there was a striking contrast. The ex­ ternal universe appeared to be an automaton following deter­ ministic causal laws, in contrast with the spontaneous activity  and irreversibility we experience. The two worlds are now  drawing closer together . Is this a loss for the natural sciences?  Classical science aimed at a "transparent" view of the phys­ ical universe. In each case you would be able to identify a  cause and an effect. Whenever a stochastic description be­ comes necessary , this is no longer so. We can no longer speak  of causality in each individual experiment; we can only speak  about statistical causality. This has, in fact, been the case ever  since the advent of quantum mechanics, but it has been greatly  amplified by recent developments in which randomness and  probability play an essential role, even in classical dynamics  or chemistry . Therefore, the modern trend as compared to the  classical one leads to a kind of "opacity" as compared to the  transparency of classical thought.  Is this a defeat for the human mind? This is a difficult ques­ tion. As scientists, we have no choice; we cannot describe for  you the world as we would like to see it, but only as we are  able to see it through the �ombined impa�t of experimental </p><div id="pagenum"><p>344</p></div><p id="page">ORDER OUT OF CHAOS 312  results and new theoretical concepts. Also, we believe that  this new situation reflects the situation we seem to find in our  own mental activity. Classical psychology centered around  conscious, transparent activity; modern psychology attaches  much weight to the opaque functioning of the unconscious.  Perhaps this is an image of the basic features of human exis­ tence. Remember Oedipus, the lucidity of his mind in front of  the sphinx and its opacity and darkness when confronted with  his own origins. Perhaps the coming together of our in sights  about the world around us and the world inside us is a satisfy­ ing feature of the recent evolution in science that we have tried  to describe.  It is hard to avoid the impression that the distinction be­ tween what exists in time, what is irreversible, and, on the  other hand, what is outside of time, what is eternal, is at the  origin of human symbolic activity. Perhaps this is especially so  in artistic activity. Indeed, one aspect of the transformation of  a natural object, a stone, to an object of art is closely related to  our impact on matter. Artistic activity breaks the temporal  symmetry of the object. It leaves a mark that translates our  temporal dissymmetry into the temporal dissymmetry of the  object. Out of the reversible, nearly cyclic noise level in which  we live arises music that is both stochastic and time-oriented.  The Renewal of Nature  It is quite remarkable that we are at a moment both of pro­ found change in the scientific concept of nature and of the  structure of human society as a result of the demographic ex­ plosion. As a result, there is a need for new relations between  man and nature and between man and man. We can no longer  accept the old a priori distinction between scientific and ethi­ cal values. This was possible at a time when the external world  and our internal world appeared to conflict, to be nearly  orthogonal. Today we know that time is a construction and  therefore carries an ethical responsibility .  The ideas to which we have devoted much space in this  book-the ideas of instability, of fluctuation-diffuse into the  social sciences. We know now that societies are immensely </p><div id="pagenum"><p>345</p></div><p id="page">313 FROM EARTH TO HEAVEN- THE REENCHANTMENT OF NATURE  complex systems involving a potentially enormous number of  bifurcations exemplified by the variety of cultures that have  evolved in the relatively short span of human history. We know  that such systems are highly sensitive to fluctuations. This  leads both to hope and a threat: hope, since even small fluc­ tuations may grow and change the overall structure. As a re­ sult, individual activity is not doomed to insignificance. On  the other hand, this is also a threat, since in our universe the  security of stable, permanent rules seems gone forever. We are  living in a dangerous and uncertain world that inspires no  blind confidence, but perhap s only the same feeling of  qualified hope that some Talmudic texts appear to have at­ tributed to the God of Genesis:  1\venty-six attempts preceded the present genesis, all of  which were destined to fail. The world of man has arisen  out of the chaotic heart of the preceding debris; he too is  exposed to the risk of failure, and the return to nothing.  "Let's hope it works" [Halway Sheyaamod] exclaimed  God as he created the World, and this hope, which has  accompanied all the subsequent history of the world and  mankind, has emphasized right from the outset that this  history is branded with the mark of radical uncertainty.24 </p><div id="pagenum"><p>346</p></div><p id="page"></p><div id="pagenum"><p>347</p></div><p id="page">NOTES  Introduction  I.

In "Race and History" (Structural Anthropology II, New York:  Basic Books, 1976), Claude Levi-Strauss discusses the condi­ tions that lead to the Neolithic and Industrial revolutions. The  model he introduces, involving chain reactions and catalysis (a  process with kinetics characterized by threshold and amplifica­ tion phenomena) attests to an affinity between the problems of  stability and fluctuation we discuss in Chapter VI as well as cer­ tain themes of the "structural approach" in anthropology.  14.

LEvi-STRA USS, L'Homme  Nu (Paris: Pion, 1971), p. 585. Thus mythical discourse is to be  distinguished from critical (scientific and philosophic) dialogue  more because of the practical conditions of its reproduction than  because of an intrinsic inability of such or such emitter to think  in a rational way. The practice of critical dialogue has given to  the cosmological discourse claiming truthfulness its spectacular  evolutive acceleration.  15. This is, of course, one of the main themes of Alexandre Koyre.  16. The definition of such an "absurdity" opposes the age-long idea  that a sufficiently tricky device would permit one to cheat na­ ture.

Popper translated into a norm this excitement born out of the  risks involved in the experimental games.

At least it was triumphant in the academies created in France,  Prussia, and Russia by absolute sovereig ns. In The Scientist' s  Role in Society (Englewood Cliffs, N.J.: Foundations of Modern  Sociology Series, Prentice-Hall, 1971), Ben David emphasized  the distinction between physicists of these countries, dedicated  to physics as a glamorous and purely theoretical science, and  the English physicists immerged in a wealth of empirical and  technical problems. Ben David proposed a connection between  the fascination for a theoretical science and the relegation far  from political power of the social class supporting the "scientific  movement ."  27. In his biography of d�lembert-Jean d'Alembert, Science and  Enlightenment (Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1970)-Thomas  Hankins emphasized how closed and small was the first true  scientific community , in the modern sense of the term, namely,  that of the eighteenth-century physicists and mathema ticians,  and how intimate were their relations with. the absolute sov­ ereigns.  28.

This at least is the conclusion of today's historians who began  the study of the impressive mass of Newton's ·�tchemical Pa­ pers," which till now were ignored or disdained as "nonscien­ tific." See B. J. DoBBS, The Foundations of Newton's Alchemy  (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1975); R. WESTFALL,  "Newton and the Hermetic Tradition" in Science, Medicine and  Society, ed. A. G. DEBUS (London: Heinemann, 1972); and R.  WESTFALL, "The Role of Alchemy in Newton's Career," Rea­ son, Experiment and Mysticism, ed. M. L. RIGHINI BONELLI  and W. R. SHEA (London: Macmillan, 1975). As Lord Keynes,  who played a crucial part in the collection of these papers, sum­ marized (quoted in DoBBS, op. cit., p. 13), "Newton was not the  first of the age of reason. He was the last of the Babylonians and  Sumerians, the last great mind which looked out on the visible  and intellectual world with the same eyes as those who began to  build our intellectual inheritance rather less than 10,000 years  ago."  5. DoBBS, op. cit., also examined the role of the "mediator" by  which two substances are made "sociable." We may recall here  the importance of the mediator in Goethe's Elective Affinities  (Engl. trans. Greenwood 1976). For what concerns chemist ry,  Goethe was not far from Newton.  6.

We do not wish to try to explain here the reasons of Newton's  triumph in France, nor of its fall, but to emphasize the at least  chronological connection between these events and the stages of  the process of professionaliz ation of science. See M. CROS·  LAND, The Society of Arcueil: A View of French Science at the  Time of Napoleon (London: Heinemann, 1960), as well as his  Gay Lussac (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1978).  11. Thomas Kuhn made of this role of scientific institutions, taking  over the formation of the future scientists -that is assuring their  own reproduction, the main characteristic of scientific activity  as we know it today. This problem has also been approac hed by  M. Crosland, R. Hahn, and W. Farrar in The Emergence of Sci­ ence in Western Europe, ed. M. CROSLAND (London : Mac·  millan, 1975).  12. The role of "mundane" interest so despised by philosophers  such as Gaston Bachelard in France should be taken as the sign  of the open character of eighteenth-century science. In a way,  we can truly speak about a regression during the nineteenth cen­ tury, at least for what concerns the scientific culture. And we  could learn today from the multiplicity of local academies and  circles where scientific matters were discussed by nonprofessio­ nals.  13. Quoted in J.

In this study of Zola's "Docteur Pascal," Feux et signaux de  brume Paris: Grassel (1975), p. 109, Michel Serres wrote: "The  century that was practically drawing to a close when the novel  appeared had opened with the majestic stability of the solar sys­ tem, and was now filled with dismay at the relentless degrada­ tions of fire. Hence the fierce, positive dilemma: perfect cycle  without residue, eternal and positively valued, i.e., the cosmol­ ogy of the sun; or else a missed cycle, losing its difference, irre­ versible, historical and despised -a cosmolo gy, a thermogony of  fire which must either be extinguished or destroyed, without al­ ternative. One dreams of Laplace, whilst Carnot and the others  have forever smashed the cubby-hole, the niche , where one </p><div id="pagenum"><p>356</p></div><p id="page">ORDER OUT OF CHAOS 324  could sleep in peace; one is dreaming, that is certain: then  cultural archaisms having returned through another door,  through another opening of the same door, are powerfully re­ awakened: immortal flame, purifying blaze or evil fire?"  13. The continuity between Carnot father and son has been empha­ sized by Cardwell (From Watt to Clausius) and Scott (The Con­ flict Between Atomism and Conservation Theory).  14. P.

What was particularly important was to grasp that, unlike what  happens in mechanics, it is not just any situation of a ther­ modynamic system that can be characterized as a "state"; quite  the contr ary. See E. DAUB, "Entropy and Dissipation," Histor­ ical Studies in the Physical Sciences, Vol. 2 (1970), pp. 321-54.  17. In his autobiography , Scientific Autobiography (London:  Williams & Norgate, 1950), Max Planck recalled how isolated he  had been when he first emphasized the peculiarity of heat and  pointed out that it is the conversion of heat into another form of  energy that raises the irreversibility problem. Energet icists such  as Ostwald wanted all forms of energy to be given the same  status. For them, the fall of a body between two altitude levels  takes place by virtue of the same kind of productive difference  as the passage of heat between two bodies at different tempera­ tures. Thus, Ostwald's comparison did away with the crucial  distinction between an ideally reversible process, such as the  mechanical motion, and an intrinsically irreversible one, such as  heat diffusion. By doing so, he was actually taking up a position  similar to what we have attributed to Lagrange : where Lagrange  considered conservation of energy as a property belonging only  to ideal cases but also the only one capable of being treated  rigorously, Ostwald held conserv ation of energy as the property  of any natural transformatio n, but defined conservation of en­ ergy differences (required by all transformation since only a dif­ ference can produce another difference) as an abstract ideal, but  the sole object for a rational science.  18. The splitting of the entropy variation into two different terms  was introduced in l.

For a theoreti cian physicist such as de Donder, chemi­ cal activity, which appeared obscure and inaccessible to the ra­ tional approach of mechanics, was mysterious enough to  become the synonym of the irreversible process. Thus chemis­ try, whose question physicists had never truly answered, and the  new enigma of irreversibility came to join in a challenge not to be  ignored anymor e. See Th.

The concept of chreod is part of the qualitative description of  embryological development Waddington proposed more than  twenty years ago. It is truly a bifurcating evolution: a pro­ gressive exploration along which the embryo grows in an "epi­ genetic landscape" where coexist stable segments and segments  where a choice among several developmental paths is possible.  See C. H. WADDINGTON, The Strategy of the Genes (London:  Allen & Unwin, 1957). C. H. Waddington's chreods are also a  central reference in Rene Thorn's biological thought. They could  thus become a meeting point for two approaches: the one we are  presenting, starting from local mechanisms and exploring the </p><div id="pagenum"><p>359</p></div><p id="page">327 NOTES  spectrum of collective behaviors they can generate; and Thorn's,  starting from global mathematical entities and connecting the  qualitatively distinct forms and transformations they imply with  the phenomenological description of morphog enesis.  16.

Watanabe introduces a strong distinction be­ tween the world to be contemplated and the world upon which  we, as active agents, work; he states there is no consistent way  of speaking about entropy increase if it is not in connection with  our actions on the world. However , all our physics is in fact  about the world to be acted on, and Watanabe's distinction thus  does not help to clarify the relat ion between "microscopic deter­ ministic symmetry" and "macroscopic probabilistic asymme­ try." The question is left without an answer. How can we  meaningfully say that the sun is irreversibly burning? See S.  WATANABE, "Time and the Probabilistic View of the World,"  The Voices of Time, ed.
