But do we  know precisely the importance that, in the course of these past fifteen or  twenty years, up to the very frontiers of the establishment, a 'work' like that  of Georges Canguilhem can have had for those very people who were separ­ ated from, or challenged, the establishment? Yes, I know, there have been  noisier theatres: psychoanalysis, Marxism, linguistics, ethnology. But let us  not forget this fact which depends, as you will, on the sociology of French  intellectual environments, the functioning of our university institutions or  our system of cultural values: in all the political or scientific discussions of  these strange sixty years past, the role of the 'philosophers' -I simply mean  those who had received their university training in philosophy departments - has been important: perhaps too important for the liking of certain people.  And, directly or indirectly, all or almost all these philosophers have had to  'come to terms with' the teaching and books of Georges Canguilhem.  From this, a paradox: this man, whose work is austere, intentionally and  carefully limited to a particular domain in the history of science, which in  any case does not pass for a spectacular discipline, has somehow found him­ self present in discussions where he himself took care never to figure. But  take away Canguilhem and you will no longer understand much about  Althusser, Althusserism and a whole series of discussions which have taken  place among French Marxists; you will no longer grasp what is specific to  sociologists such as Bourdieu, Castel, Passersonand what marks them so  strongly within sociology; you will miss an entire aspect of the theoretical  work done by psychoanalysts, particularly by the followers of Lacan. Further,  in the entire discussion of ideas which preceded or followed the movement of  '68, it is easy to fmd the place of those who, from near or from afar, had been  trained by Canguilhem.  Without ignoring the cleavages which, during these last years after the end  of the war, were able to oppose Marxists and non-Marxists, Freudians and  non-Freudians, specialists in a single discipline and philosophers, academics  and non-academics, theorists and politicians, it does seem to me that one  could fmd another dividing line which cuts through all these oppositions. It  ix </p><div id="pagenum"><p>7</p></div><p id="page">x ONTHENORMALANDTHEPATHOLOGOCAL  is the line that separates a philosophy of experience, of sense, and of subject  and a philosophy of knowledge, of rationality and of concept. On the one  hand, one network is that of Sartre and Merleau-Ponty; and then another is  that of Cavailles, Bachelard and Canguilhem. In other words we are dealing  with two modalities according to which phenomenology was taken up in  France, when quite late -around 1930 -it fmally began to be, if not known,  at least recognized. Contemporary philosophy in France began in those years.  The lectures on transcendental phenomenology delivered in 1929 by Husserl  (translated by Gabrielle Peiffer and Emmanuel Levinas as Meditations carte­ siennes, Paris, Colin, 1931; and by Dorion Cairns as Cartesian Meditations,  The Hague, Nijhoff, 1960) marked the moment: phenomenology entered  France through that text. But it allowed of two readings: one, in the direction  of a philosophy of the subject -and this was Sartre's article on the 'Trans­ cendance de I'Ego' (1935) and another which went back to the founding  principles of Hussert's thought: those of formalism and intuitionism, those  of the theory of science, and in 1938 Cavailles' two theses on the axiomatic  method and the formation of set theory. Whatever they may have been after  shifts, ramifications, interactions, even rapprochements, these two forms of  thought in France have constituted two philosophical directions which have  remained profoundly heterogeneous.  On the surface the second of these has remained at once the most theore­ tical, the most bent on speculative tasks, and also the most academic. And  yet it was this form which played the most important role in the sixties,  when a 'crisis' began, a crisis concerning not only the University but also the  status and role of knowledge. We must ask ourselves why such a mode of  reflection, following its own logic, could tum out to be so profoundly tied to  the present.  Undoubtedly one of the principal reasons stems from this: the history of  science avails itself of one of the themes which was introduced almost sur­ reptitiously into late eighteenth century philosophy: for the first time rational  thought was put in question not only as to its nature, its foundation, its  powers and its rights, but also as to its history and its geography; as to its  immediate past and its present reality; as to its time and its place. This is the  question which Mendelssohn and then Kant tried to answer in 1784 in the  Berlinische Monatschrift: 'Was ist Aufldarung?' ('What is Enlightenment?'),  These two texts inaugurated a 'philosophical journalism' which, along with  university teaching, was one of the major forms of the institutional im­ plantation of phiiosollhy in the nineteenth century (and we know how fertile  it sometimes was, as in the 1840's in Germany). They also opened philosophy </p><div id="pagenum"><p>8</p></div><p id="page">INTRODUCTION xi  up to a whole historico-critical dimension. And this work always involves two  objectives which in fact cannot be dissociated and which incessantly echo one  another: on the one hand, to look for what was the moment (in its chronol­ ogy, its constituent elements, its historical conditions) when the West first  asserted the autonomy and sovereignty of its own rationality: the Lutheran  Reformation, the 'Copernican Revolution', Cartesian philosophy, the Galilean  mathematization of nature, Newtonian physics? On the other hand, to  analyze the 'present' moment and, in terms of what was the history of this  reason as well as of what can be its present balance, to look for that relation  which must be established with this founding act: rediscovery, taking up a  forgotten direction, completion or rupture, return to an earlier moment, etc.  Undoubtedly we should ask why this question of the Enlightenment,  without ever disappearing, had such a different destiny in Germany, France  and the Anglo-Saxon countries; why here and there it was invested in such  different domains and according to such varied chronologies. Let us say in  any case that German philosophy gave it substance above all in a historical  and political reflection on society (with one privileged moment: the Reforma­ tion; and a central problem: religious experience in its relation with the eco­ nomy and the state); from the Hegelians to the Frankfort School and to  Lukacs, Feuerbach, Marx, Nietzsche and Max Weber it bears witness to this.  In France it is the history of science which has above all served to support the  philosophical question of the Enlightenment; after all, the positivism of  Comte and his successors was one way of once again taking up the questioning  by Mendelssohn and Kant on the scale of a general history of societies. Know­ ledge belief; the scientific form of knowledge and the religious contents of  representation; or the transition from the pre-scientific or scientific; the con­ stitution of a rational way of knowing on the basis of traditional experience;  the appearance, in the midst of a history of ideas and beliefs, of a type of his­ tory suitable to scientific knowledge; the origin and threshold of rationality - it is under this form, through positivism (and those opposed to it), through  Duhem, Poincare, the noisy debates on scientism and the academic discussions  about medieval science, that the question of the Enlightenment was broUght  into France. And if phenomenology, after quite a long period when it was  kept at the border, finally penetrated in its turn, it was undoubtedly the day  when Hussed, in the Cartesian Meditations and the Crisis (The Crisis of  European Sciences and Transcendental Phenomenology, translated by David  Carr, Evanston, m., Northwestern University Press, 1970) posed the question  of the relations between the 'Western' project of a universal development of  reason, the positivity of the sciences and the radicality of philosophy.  If I have insisted on these points, it is to show that for a century and a half </p><div id="pagenum"><p>9</p></div><p id="page">xii ON THE NORMAL AND THE PATHOLOGICAL  the history of science in France carried philosophical stakes within itself  which are easily recognized. Works such as those of Koyre, Bachelard, or  Canguilhem could indeed have had as their centers of reference precise, 'regio­ nal', chronologically well-defined domains in the history of science but they  have functioned as important centers of philosophical elaboration to the ex­ tent that, under different facets, they set into play this question of the En­ lightenment which is essential to contemporary philosophy.  If we were to look outside of France for something corresponding to the  work of Cavailies, Koyre, Bachelard and Canguilhem, it is undoubtedly in the  Frankfurt School that we would find it. And yet, the styles are quite different:  the ways of doing things, the domains treated. But in the end both pose the  same kind of questions, even if here they are haunted by the memory of  Descartes, there by the ghost of Luther. These questionings are those which  must be addressed to a rationality which makes universal claims while  developing in contingency; which asserts its unity and yet proceeds only by  means of partial modification when not by general recastings; which authen­ ticates itself through its own sovereignty but which in its history is perhaps  not dissociated from inertias, weights which coerce it, subjugate it. In the  history of science in France as in German critical theory, what we are to  examine essentially is a reason whose autonomy of structures carries with it­ self the history of dogmatisms and despotisms - a reason which, consequent­ ly, has the effect of emancipation only on the condition that it succeeds in  freeing itself of itself.  Several processes, marking the second half of the twentieth century, have  led to the heart of contemporary preoccupations concerning the question of  the Enlightenment. The first is the importance acquired by scientific and  technical rationality in the development of the productive forces and the play  of political decisions. The second is the very history of a 'revolution' whose  hope, since the close of the eighteenth century, had been borne by a ratio­ nalism to which we are entitled to ask, what part it could have in the effects  of a despotism where that hope was lost.  The third and last is the movement by which, at the end of the colonial  era, people began to ask the West what rights its culture, its science, its social  organization and finally its rationality itself could have to laying claim to a  universal validity: it is not a mirage tied to an economic domination and a  political hegemony? Two centuries later the Enlightenment returns: but not  at all as a way for the West to become conscious of its actual possibilities and  freedoms to which it can have access, but as a way to question the limits and  powers it has abused. Reason -the despotic enlightenment.  Let us not be surprised that the history of science, above all in the parti-</p><div id="pagenum"><p>10</p></div><p id="page">INTRODUCTION xiii  cular form given it by Georges Canguilhem, could have occupied so central a  place in contemporary discussions in France, even if his role has remained  rather hidden.  In the history of science, such as it was practiced in France, Georges Canguil­ hem brought about a significant shift. Broadly speaking, the history of science  concerned itself by preference, if not exclusively, with disciplines which were  'noble' in terms of the antiquity of their foundation, their high degree of  formalization and their fitness for mathematization; in terms of the privileged  position they occupied in the positivist hierarchy of the sciences. To remain  close to these sciences which, from the Greeks to Leibniz, had, in short, been  an integral part of philosophy, the history of science hid what it believed it  was obliged to forget: that it was not philosophy. Canguilhem has focussed  almost all his work on the history of biology and medicine, knowing full well  that the theoretical importance of the problems raised by the development of  a science are not perforce in direct proportion to the degree of formalization  reached by it. Thus he brought the history of science down from the heights  (mathematics, astronomy, Galilean mechanics, Newtonian physics, relativity  theory) toward the middle regions where knowledge is much less deductive,  much more dependent on external processes (economic stimulations or  institutional supports) and where it has remained tied much longer to the  marvels of the imagination.  But in bringing about this shift, CanguiIhem did more than assure the  revaluation of a relatively neglected domain. He did not simply broaden the  field of the history of science; he recast the disCipline itself on a certain  number of essential points.  (I) He took up again the theme of 'discontinuity' -an old theme which  stood out very early, to the point of being contemporary, or almost, with the  birth of the history of science. What marks such a history, Fontenelle said, is  the sudden formation of certain sciences 'starting from nothing'; the extreme  rapidity of some progress which was hardly expected ; the distance separating  scientific knowledge from 'common usage' and the motives which could  stimulate scientists; and furthermore the polemical form ofthis history which  does not stop recounting the battles against 'prejudices', 'resistances', and  'obstacles'. 1 In taking up this same theme elaborated by Koyre and Bachelard,  CanguiIhem insists that for him marking discontinuities is neither a postulate  nor a result, but rather a 'way of doing', a process which is an integral part of  the history of science because it is summoned by the very object which must  be treated by it. In fact this history of science is not a history of the true, of  its slow epiphany; it would not be able to claim that it recounts the progres-</p><div id="pagenum"><p>11</p></div><p id="page">xiv ON THE NORMAL AND THE PATHOLOGICAL  sive discovery of a truth 'inscribed forever in things or in the intellect', except  to imagine that contemporary knowledge finally possesses it so completely  and definitively that it can start from it to measure the past. And yet the  history of science is not a pure and simple history of ideas and the conditions  in which they appeared before being obliterated. In the history of science the  truth cannot be given as acquired, but one can no longer economize on a  relation to the truth and the true-false opposition. It is this reference to the  'true-false' which gives this history its specificity and importance. In what  form? By conceiving that one is dealing with the history of 'truthful dis­ courses', that is, discourses which rectify, correct themselves and which  effect on themselves a whole work of elaboration finalized by the· task of  'speaking true'. The historical tie which the different moments of science  can have with one another necessarily has this form of discontinuity con­ stituted by the alterings, reshapings, elucidations of new foundations, changes  in scale, the transition to a new kind of objects -"the perpetual revision of  contents through thorough examination and amendment", as Cavailles said.  Error is not eliminated by the muffled force of a truth which gradually  emerges from the shadow but by the formation of a new way of 'speaking  true'.2 One of the conditions of possibility because of which a history of  science was formed at the beginning of the eighteenth century was, as  Canguilhem notes, the awareness that there had been recent scientific 'revo­ lutions': that of algebraic geometry and the infinitesimal calculus, of Coper­ nican and Newtonian cosmology.2  (2) Whoever says 'history of truthful discourse' also says recurrent  method, not in the sense where the history of science would say: let the  truth be finally recognized today, how long has one foreseen it, what paths  had to be followed, what errors averted to discover it and prove it? But in the  sense that the successive transformations of this truthful discourse continuous­ ly produce reshapings of their own history; what had for a long time remained  a dead-end, today becomes an exit; a 'side' attempt becomes a central problem  around which all the others gravitate; a slightly divergent step becomes a  fundamental break: the discovery of non-cellular fermentation - a 'side'  phenomenon during the reign of Pasteur and his microbiology -marked an  essential break only when the physiology of enzymes developed. 3 In short,  the history of discontinuities is not acquired once and for all; it is itself  'impermanent' and discontinuous.  Must we conclude from this that science spontaneously makes and remakes  its own history at every instant, to the point that the only authorized historian  of a science could be the scientist himself, reconstituting the past of  what he was engaged in doing? The problem for Canguilhem is not a matter </p><div id="pagenum"><p>12</p></div><p id="page">INTRODUCTION xv  of a profession: it is a matter of a point of view. The history of science can­ not be content with bringing together what past scientists were able to  believe or demonstrate; a history of plant physiology is not written by  amassing  everything that people called botanists, physicians, chemists, horticulturists, agrono­ mists, economists could write down, touching on their conjectures, observations or  experiences with regard to the relations between structure and function for objects  which are sometimes called grass, sometimes plants, sometimes vegetables. 5  But one does not make history of science either by refIltering the past through  the set of statements or theories valid now, thus disclosing in what was 'false'  the true to come, and in what was true, the error made manifest later on.  Here is one of the fundamental points of Canguilhem's method: the history  of science can consist in what it has that is specific only by taking into  account the epistemological point of view between the pure historian and the  scientist himself. This point of view is that which causes a 'hidden, ordered  progression' to appear through different episodes of scientific knowledge: this  means that the processes of elimination and selection of statements, theories,  objects are made at each instant in terms of a certain norm; and this norm  cannot be indentified with a theoretical structure or an actual paradigm  because today's scientific truth is itself only an episode of it -let us say pro­ visional at most. It is not by depending on a 'normal science' in ,T.S. Kuhn's  sense that one can return to the past and validly trace its, history: it is in  rediscovering the 'norm' process, the actual knowledge of which is only one  moment of it, without one being able, save for prophesying, to predict the  future. This history of science, says Canguilhem quoting Suzanne Bachelard,  can construct its object only 'in an ideal space-time'. And this space time is  given to the history of science neither by the 'realist' time accumulated by  the historian's erudition nor by the idealized space authoritatively cut out by  today's science, but by the point of view of epistemology. The latter is not  the general theory of all science or of every possible scientific statement; it is  the search for normativity within different scientific activities, such that they  have effectively been brought into play. Hence we are dealing with an indis­ pensable theoretical reflection which a history of science can form for itself  in a way different from history in general; and conversely the history of  science opens up the area for analysis which is indispensable in order for  epistemology to be something other than the simple reproduction of schemes  within a science at a given moment. 6 In the method used by Canguilhem, the  elaboration of 'discontinuist' analyses and the elucidation of the history of  science/epistemology relation go hand in hand. </p><div id="pagenum"><p>13</p></div><p id="page">xvi ON THE NORMAL AND THE PATHOLOGICAL  (3) Now, in placing the life sciences within this historico-epistemological  perspective, Canguilhem brings to light a certain number of essential traits  which single out the development of these sciences; and for their historians  they pose specific problems. One had been able to believe around the time of  Bichat that between a physiology studying the phenomena of life and a  pathology dedicated to the analysis of diseases, one was finally about to  disentangle what had remained confused for a long time in the mind of those  who were studying the human body in order to 'cure' it; and that having thus  been freed from every immediate care of practice and every value judgment as  to the good and evil functioning of the organism, one was finally going to be  able to develop a pure and rigorous 'science of life'. But it proved impossible  to make up a science of the living being without having taken into account, as  essential to its object, the possibility of disease, death, monstrosity, anomaly,  error (even if genetics gives this last word a meaning completely different  from that intended by eighteenth century physicians when they spoke of an  error of nature). You see, the living being involves self-regulation and self­ preservation processes; with increasing subtlety we can know the physico­ chemical mechanisms which assure them: they nonetheless mark a specificity  which the life sciences must take into account, save for themselves omitting  what properly constitutes their object and their own domain.  Hence a paradoxial fact in the life sciences: it is that if the 'scientifici­ zation' process is done by bringing to light physical and chemical mechanisms,  by the constitution of domains such as the chemistry of cells and molecules  or such as biophysics, by the utilization of mathematical models, etc .... ; it  has, on the other hand, been able to develop only insofar as the problem of  the specificity of life and of the threshold it marks among all natural beings  was continually thrown back as a challenge. 7 This does not mean that 'vita­ lism', which has circulated so many images and perpetuated so many myths,  is true. It does not mean that this idea, which has been so often rooted in less  rigorous philosophies, must constitute the invincible philosophy of biologists.  It simply means that it has had and undoubtedly still has an essential role as  an 'indicator' in the history of biology. And this in two respects: as a theore­ tical indicator of problems to be solved (that is, what, in genenil, constitutes  the originiality of life without, in any way, constituting an independent  empire in nature); as a critical indicator of reductions to be avoided (that is,  all those which tend to ignore the fact that the life sciences cannot do with­ out a certain position of value indicating preservation, regulation, adaptation,  reproduction, etc .... ). 'A demand rather than a method, a morality more than  a theory' 8.  Enlarging on the point, we could say that the constant problem in all </p><div id="pagenum"><p>14</p></div><p id="page">INTRODUCTION xvii  Canguilhem's work, from the Essai sur Ie normal et Ie pathologique of 1943  to Ideologie et rationalite dans l'histoire des sciences de la vie (,Ideology and  Rationality in the History of the Life Sciences') of 1977, has been the  relation between science of life and vitalism: a problem which he tackled  both in showing the irreducibility of the problem of disease as a problem  essential to every science of life, and in studying what has constituted the  speculative climate, the theoretical context of the life sciences.  (4) What Canguilhem studies in a privileged way in the history of biology  is the 'formation of concepts'. Most of the historical investigations he has  conducted tum on this constitution: the concept of reflex, environment,  monster and monstrosity, cell, internal secretion, regulation. There are several  reasons for this. First of all it is because the role of a strictly biological con­ cept is to cut out from the ensemble of the phenomena 'of life' those which  allow one, without reducing, to analyze the processes proper to living beings  (thUS, among all the phenomena of resemblance, disappearance, mingling,  recurrence proper to heredity, the concept of 'hereditary trait' has broUght  about a similar 'cutting out'): there is no object pertinent to biological science  unless it has been 'conceived'. But, on the other hand, the concept does not  constitute a limit which cannot be transcended by alaysis: on the contrary it  must give access to a structure of intelligibility such that elementary analysis  (that of chemistry or physics) allows one to show up the specific processes of  the living being (this same concept of the hereditary trait led to a chemical  analysis of the mechanisms of reproduction). Canguilhem insists that an idea  becomes a biological concept at the moment the reductive effects, which are  tied to an external analogy, become obliterated for the benefit of a specific  analysis of the living being; the concept of 'reflex' was not formed as a biolo­ gical concept when Willis applied the image of a reflected light ray to an auto­ matic movement; but it did happen the day Prochaska could write it down in  the analysis of sensory-motor functions and their centralization in relation to  the brain.9 Canguilhem would undoubtedly allow one to say that the moment  which must be considered strategically decisive in a history of physics is that  of the formalization and constitution of the theory; but the moment that  counts in a history of the biological sciences is that of the constitution of the  object and the formation of the concept.  The life sciences call for a certain manner of making their history. In a  singular fashion they also pose the philosophical question of knowledge.  Life and death are never in themselves problems of physics, although in  his work even the physicist risks his own life or that of others; for him these  are questions of morals or politics, not of science. As A. Lwoff said, lethal or </p><div id="pagenum"><p>15</p></div><p id="page">xviii ON THE NORMAL AND THE PATHOLOGICAL  not, for the physicist a genetic mutation is neither more nor less than the sub­ stitution of one nucleic acid base for another. But it is in this very difference  that the biologist recognizes the mark of his object; and an object of a type  to which he himself belongs, since he lives and he manifests the nature of the  living being, he exercises it, he develops it in an activity of knowledge which  must be understood as a "general method for the direct or indirect resolution  of tensions between man and the environment". The biologist must grasp  what makes life a specific object of knowledge and thereby what makes it  such that there are at the heart of living beings, because they are living beings,  some beings susceptible to knowing, and, in the final analysis, to knowing life  itself.  Phenomenology asked of 'actual experience' the original meaning of every  act of knowledge. But can we not, or must we not look for it in the 'living  being' himself?  Canguilhem, through the elucidation of knowledge concerning life and the  concepts which articulate this knowledge, wants to rediscover which of them  belongs to the concept of life. That is, the concept insofar as it is one of the  modes of this information which every living being levies on his environment  and by means of which, on the other hand, he structures his environment.  That man lives in a conceptually architectured environment does not prove  that he has been diverted from life by some oversight or that a historical  drama has separated him from it; but only that he lives in a certain way, that  he has a relationship with his environment such that he does not have a fixed  point of view of it, that he can move on an undefined territory, that he must  move about to receive information, that he must move things in relation to  one another in order to make them useful. Forming concepts is one way of  living, not of killing life; it is one way of living in complete mobility and not  immobilizing life; it is showing, among these millions of living beings who in­ form their environment and are informed from it outwards, an innovation  which will be judged trifling or substantial as you will: a very particular type  of information.  Hence the importance Canguilhem accords the meeting, in the life sciences,  of the old question of the normal and the pathological with the set of notions  that biology, in the course of the last decades, has borrowed from information  theory: code, messages, messengers, etc. From this point of view Le normal et  Ie pathologique, written in part in 1943 and in part in the period 1963-66,  constitutes without any doubt the most important and the most significant of  Canguilhem's works. Here we see how the problem of the specificity of life  recently found itself bent in one direction where we meet some of the prob-</p><div id="pagenum"><p>16</p></div><p id="page">INTRODUCTION xix  lems believed to belong in their own right to the most developed forms of  evolution.  At the heart of these problems is that of error. For at life's most basic  level, the play of code and decoding leaves room for chance, which, before  being disease, deficit or monstrosity, is something like perturbation in the  information system, something like a 'mistake'. In the extreme, life is what  is capable of error. And it is perhaps this given or rather this fundamental  eventuality which must be called to account concerning the fact that the  question of anomaly crosses all of biology, through and through. We must  also -call it to account for mutations and the evolutionary processes they  induce. We must also call it to account for this singular mutation, this 'here­ ditary error' which makes life result, with man, in a living being who is never  completely at home, a living being dedicated to 'error' and destined, in the  end, to 'error'. And if we admit that the concept is the answer that life itself  gives to this chance, it must be that error is at the root of what makes human  thought and its history. The opposition of true and false, the values we attri­ bute to both, the effects of power that different societies and different insti­ tutions link to this division -even all this is perhaps only the latest response  to this possibility of error, which is intrinsic to life. If the history of science is  discontinuous, that is, if it can be analyzed only as a series of 'corrections', as  a new distribution of true and false which never finally, once and for all,  liberates the truth, it is because there, too, 'error' constitutes not overlooking  or delaying a truth but the dimension proper to the life of men and to the  time of the species.  Nietzsche said that truth was the most profound lie. Canguilhem, who is at  once close to and far from Nietzsche, would say perhaps that on the enor­ mous calendar of life, it is the most recent error; he would say that the true­ false division and the value accorded truth constitute the most singular way  of living which could have been invented by a life which, from its furthermost  origin, carried the eventuality of error within itself. Error for Canguilhem is  the permanent chance around which the history of life and that of men  develops. It is this notion of error which allows him to join what he knows  about biology to the way he works its history without ever having wanted,  as was done at the time of evolutionism, to deduce the latter from the former.  It is this notion which allows him to mark the relation between life and the  knowledge of life, and to follow, like a red thread, the presence of value and  norm.  This historian of rationalities, himself a 'rationalist', is a philosopher of  error: I mean that it is in starting from error that he poses philosophical  problems, I should say, the philosophical problem of truth and life. Here we </p><div id="pagenum"><p>17</p></div><p id="page">xx ON THE NORMAL AND THE PATHOLOGICAL  touch on what is undoubtedly one of the fundamental events in the history  of modern philosophy: if the great Cartesian break posed the question of the  relations between truth and subject, the eighteenth century, as far as the  relations of truth and life are concerned, introduced a series of questions of  which the Critique of Judgment and The Phenomenology of Spirit were the  first great formulations. And from then on it was one of the stakes of philoso­ phical discussions: is it that knowledge of life must be considered as nothing  more than one of the regions which depends on the general question of truth,  subject and knowledge? Or is it that it obliges us to pose this question differ­ ently? Is it that the entire theory of the subject must not be reformulated  since knowledge, rather than opening itself up to the truth of the world, is  rooted in the 'errors' of life? We understand why Canguilhem's thought, his  work as a historian and philosopher, could have so decisive an importance  in France for all those who, starting from different points of view (whether  theorists of Marxism, psychoanalysis or linguistics) have tried to rethink the  question of the subject. Phenomenology could indeed introduce the body,  sexuality, death, the perceived world into the field of analysis; the Cogito  remained central; neither the rationality of science nor the specificity of the  life sciences could compromise its founding role. It is to this philosophy of  meaning, subject and the experienced thing that Canguilhem has opposed a  philosophy of error, concept, and the living being.

Professor at the Sorbonne and director for many years, until his retirement,  of the Institut d'Histoire des Sciences et des Techniques de l'Universite de  Paris, he has played a major role in shaping scholarship in the history and  philosophy of science. Although largely unknown outside of France (the  present volume is his first to appear in English) he has taught and influenced  a whole generation of scholars whose works have given testimony to his own  inventive methods and innovative style. Among those who have been members  of the Institut are Michel Foucault, Michel Serre, Fran~ois Dagonet, Claire  Saloman-Bayet, Camille Limoges, Dominique Lecourt, Roshdi Rashed and  Suzanne Bachelard.  From his very earliest studies Canguilhem has shown a continued interest  in epistemological problems and conceptual forms and developments. By and  large he has eschewed the reconstructivist approach to scientific change and  has instead focused on the structures of explanation and means through  which novelty was developed. In this approach he clearly reflected the  influences of his own mentor Gaston Bachelard.  Two major monographs indicate both his style and attitude of scholarship.  In addition to the present book originally published as Essai sur Quelques  Problemes Concernant Ie Normal et Ie Pathologique (in 1943) there is his  widely known study, La Formation du Concept de Re/lexe aux XVIIe et  XVIIIe Siecles (1955 and re-issued, 1977). Alongside these volumes are  several collections of essays which demonstrate Canguilhem's developing  interests and strength of analysis; the earliest of these was his provocative  La Connaissance de la Vie (1952, re-issued and augmented, 1965). In  addition his more recent works appear in Etudes d'Histoire et de Philosophie  des Sciences (1968) and Jdeologie et Rationalite dans l'Histoire des Sciences  de la Vie (1977). In collaboration with several of his former students and  associates at the Institut he has edited two volumes of an Introduction a  l'Histoire des Sciences (textes choisis), I. Elements et Instruments (1970)  and II. Objet, Methode, Exemples (1971). His deep understanding of the  work of Claude Bernard and nineteenth-century French physiology is found  not only in several essays in the volumes above but also in his 'Preface' to a  xxiii </p><div id="pagenum"><p>20</p></div><p id="page">xxiv EDITORIAL NOTE  new edition of Bernard's Le~ons sur Les Phenomenes de La Vie Communs aux  Animaux et aux Vegetaux (I 966). The important interactions he had with  his students and colleagues is shown by the papers and comments delivered at  a colloquium at the Institut in 1970. These were published as La Mathe­ matisation des Doctrines In/ormes (I972) and demonstrate the manner in  which a group of scholars attempted to get behind the meaning of terms such  as 'mathematization', 'quantification' and 'formalization' of theories. There  is a fine mix of historical case study, conceptual analysis and epistemological  inquiry.  It is our hope that the publication in English of the present book will  stimulate efforts to rupture the wall that has kept the works of this imagina­ tive French scholar from English readers.  EVERETT MENDELSOHN </p><div id="pagenum"><p>21</p></div><p id="page">FOREWORD  The present work unites two studies -one unpublished -on the same sub­ ject. It is first a re-edition of my doctoral thesis in medicine, made possible by  the gracious consent of the Publications Committee of the Faculty of Letters  at Strasbourg for this project of the Presses Universitaires de France. To those  who conceived the project as well as to those who furthered its realization, I  express here my heartfelt gratitude.  It is not for me to say whether this re-edition is necessary or not. It is true  that my thesis was fortunate enough to arouse interest in medical as well as  philosophical circles. I am left with the hope that it will not be judged now as  being too out of date.  In adding some unpublished considerations to my first Essay (Section I),  I am only trying to furnish evidence of my efforts -if not my success -to  preserve a problem, which I consider fundamental, in the same state of fresh­ ness as its everchanging factual data.

This is by no means because of my own  defmitive satisfaction with it. But, on the one hand, the Publications Com­ mittee of the Facu1ty of Letters at Strasbourg -whom I very cordially thank  for having decided to reprint my work -cou1d not afford the expense in­ volved in changing the text. On the other hand, the corrections or additions  to this first essay will be found in a future, more general work. I would only  like to indicate here those new readings, those criticisms which have been  made, those personal reflections with which I cou1d and shou1d have enriched  the first version of my essay.  To begin with, even in 1943 I could have pointed out what help I cou1d  find for the central theme of my exposition in works such as Pradines's Traite  de psychologie generale and Merleau-Ponty's Structure du comportement. I  cou1d only indicate the second, discovered when my manuscript was in press.  I had not yet read the first. Suffice it to recall the conditions for distributing  books in 1943 in order to understand the difficu1ties of documentation at  that time. Furthermore, I must confess I am not too sorry about them as I  much prefer a convergence whose fortuitous character better emphasizes the  value of intellectual necessity to an acquiescence, even fully sincere, in the  views of others.  If I were to write this essay today I would have to devote a great deal of  space to Selye's works and his theory of the state of organic alarm. This ex­ position cou1d serve to mediate between Leriche's and Goldstein's theses (at  first glance very different) of which I have the highest opinion. Selye estab­ lished that the failures or irregularities of behavior as well as the emotions and  fatigue they generate, produce through their frequent repetition, a structural  modification of the adrenal cortex analogous to that determined by the  introduction of hormonal substances, whether impure or pure but in large  doses, or toxic substances, into the internal environment. Every organic state  of disordered tension, all behavior of alarm and stress, provoke adrenal reac­ tion. This reaction is 'normal' with regard to the action and effects of corticos­ terone in the organism. Moreover, these structural reactions, which Selye calls  adaptation reactions and alarm reactions, involve the thyroid or hypophysis  3 </p><div id="pagenum"><p>24</p></div><p id="page">4 ON THE NORMAL AND THE PATHOLOGICAL  as well as the adrenal gland. But these normal (that is biologically favorable)  reactions end up wearing out the organism in the case of abnormal (that is  statistically frequent) repetitions of situations which generate the alarm reac­ tion. In certain individuals then, disadaptation diseases are set up. The repeat­ ed discharge of corticosterone provokes either functional disturbances such as  vascular spasm and hypertension or morphological lesions such as stomach  ulcer. Hence in the populations of English villages subjected to air raids in the  last war, a notable increase in cases of gastric ulcer was observed.  If these facts are interpreted from Goldstein's point of view, disease will be  seen in catastrophic behavior; if they are interpreted from Leriche's point of  view, disease will be seen in the determination of histological anomaly by  physiological disorder. These two points of view are not mutually exclusive,  far from it.  Likewise in the case of my references to the problems of teratogenesis,  today I would draw a great deal on Etienne Wolffs works on Les changements  de sexe and La science des monstres. I would insist more on the possibility  and even the obligation of enhancing the knowledge of normal formations by  using knowledge about monstrous formations. I would propose more force­ fully that there is not in itself an a priori ontological difference between a  successful living form and an unsuccessful form. Moreover, can we speak of  unsuccessful living forms? What lack can be disclosed in a living form as long  as the nature of its obligations as a living being has not been determined?  I also should have taken into account -more than the approvals or con­ firmations which reached me from physicians, psychologists, such as my  friend Lagache, professor at the Sorbonne, or biologists such as Sabiani and  Kehl at the Algiers Faculty of Medicine -the criticism, at once comprehen­ sive and firm, of Louis Bounoure of the Faculty of Sciences at Strasbourg. In  his L 'autonomie de l'etre vivant Bounoure reproaches me with as much spirit  as cordiality for yielding to the 'evolutionist obsession' and considers, if I may  say, with great perspicacity, the idea of the living being's normativity as a  projection onto all of living nature of the human tendency toward transcen­ dence. Whether it is legitimate or not to introduce History into Life (I am  thinking here of Hegel and the problems raised by the interpretation of  Hegelianism) is indeed a serious problem, at once biological and philosophi­ cal. Understandably this question cannot be tackled in a preface. At the least  I want to say that it has not escaped my attention, that I hope to tackle it  later, and that I am grateful to Bounoure for helping me to pose it.  Finally it is certain that in expounding Claude Bernard's ideas today, I  could not help taking into account the publication in 1947 by Dr Delhoume </p><div id="pagenum"><p>25</p></div><p id="page">PREFACE TO THE SECOND EDITION 5  of the Principes de medecine experimentaie, where Bernard is more precise  than elsewhere in examining the problem of the individual relativity of  the pathological fact. But essentially I do not think that my judgment of  Bernard's ideas would be modified.  In concluding I want to add that certain readers were surprised at the  brevity of my conclusions and at the fact that they leave the philosophical  door open. I must say that this was intentional. I had wanted to lay the  groundwork for a future thesis in philosophy. I was aware of having sacrificed  enough, if not too much, to the philosophical demon in a thesis in medicine.  And so I deliberately gave my conclusions the appearance of propositions  which were simply and moderately methodological. </p><div id="pagenum"><p>26</p></div><p id="page">INTRODUCTION  The problem of pathological structures and behaviors in man is enormous. A  congenital clubfoot, a sexual inversion, a diabetic, a schizophrenic, pose  innumerable questions which, in the end, refer to the whole of anatomical,  embryological, ·physiological, and psychological research. It is nevertheless  our opinion that this problem must not be broken up and that the chances  for clarifying it are greater if it is considered en bloc than if it is broken down  into questions of detail. But for the moment we are in no position to main­ tain this opinion by presenting a sufficiently documented synthesis, which we  do hope to work out one day. However, this publication of some of our  research expresses not only this present impossibility but also the intention to  mark successive phases in the inquiry.  Philosophy is a reflection for which all unknown material is good, and we  would gladly say, for which all good material must be unknown. Having taken  up medical studies some years after the end of our philosophical studies, and  parallel to teaching philosophy, we owe some explanation of our intentions.  It is not necessarily in order to be better acquainted with mental illnesses that  a professor of philosophy can become interested in medicine. Nor is it neces­ sarily in order to exercise a scientific discipline. We expected medicine to  provide precisely an introduction to concrete human problems. Medicine  seemed to us and still seems to us like a technique or art at the crossroads of  several sciences, rather than, strictly speaking, like one science. It seemed to  us that the two problems which concerned us, that of the relations between  science and technology, and that of norms and the normal, had to profit from  a direct medical education for their precise position and clarification. In  applying to medicine a spirit which we would like to be able to call 'unpre­ judiced', it seemed to us that, despite so many laudable efforts to introduce  methods of scientific rationalization, the essential lay in the clinic and thera­ peutics, that is, in a technique of establishing or restoring the normal which  cannot be reduced entirely and simply to a single form of knowledge.  The present work is thus an effort to integrate some of the methods and  attainments of medicine into philosophical speculation. It is necessary to  state that it is not a question of teaching a lesson, or of bringing a normative  judgment to bear upon medical activity. We are not so presumptuous as to  7 </p><div id="pagenum"><p>27</p></div><p id="page">8 ON THE NORMAL AND THE PATHOLOGICAL  pretend to renovate medicine by incorporating a metaphysics into it. If medi­ cine is to be renovated, it is up to physicians to do so at their risk and to their  credit. But we want to contribute to the renewal of certain methodological  concepts by adjusting their comprehension through contact with medical  information. May no one expect more from us than we wanted to give. Medi­ cine is very often prey and victim to certain pseudo-philosophical literature,  not always unknown, it must be said, to doctors, in which medicine and  philosophy rarely come out well. It is not our intention to bring grist to the  mill. Nor do we intend to behave as an historian of medicine. If we have  placed a problem in historical perspective in the first part of our book, it is  only for reasons of greater intelligibility. We claim no erudition in biography.  A word on the boundaries of our subject. From the medical point of view,  the general problem of the normal and the pathological can be defined as a  teratological problem and a nosological problem and this last, in its tum, as  a problem of somatic nosology or pathological physiology, and as a problem  of psychic nosology or pathological psychology. In the present exposition we  want to limit ourselves very strictly to the problem of somatic nosology or  pathological physiology, without, however, refraining from borrowing from  teratology or pathological psychology this datum, that notion or solution,  which would seem to us particularly suited to clarify the investigation or con­ firm some result.  We have also tried to set forth our conceptions in connection with the  critical examination of a thesis, generally adopted in the nineteenth century,  concerning the relations between the normal and the patholOgical. This is the  thesis according to which pathological phenomena are identical to corre­ sponding normal phenomena save for quantitative variations. With this proce­ dure we are yielding to a demand of philosophical thOUght to reopen rather  than close problems. Leon Brunschvicg said of philosophy that it is the  science of solved problems. We are making this simple and profound defini­ tion our own. </p><div id="pagenum"><p>28</p></div><p id="page">PART ONE  IS THE PATHOLOGICAL STATE MERELY  A QUANTITATIVE MODIFICATION  OF THE NORMAL STATE? </p><div id="pagenum"><p>29</p></div><p id="page">INTRODUCTION TO THE PROBLEM  To act, it is necessary at least to localize. For example, how do we take action  against an earthquake or hurricane? The impetus behind every ontological  theory of disease undoubtedly derives from therapeutic need. When we see in  every sick man someone whose being has been augmented or diminished, we  are somewhat reassured, for what a man has lost can be restored to him, and  what has entered him can also leave. We can hope to conquer disease even ifit  is the result of a spell, or magic, or possession; we have only to remember that  disease happens to man in order not to lose all hope. Magic brings to drugs  and incantation rites, innumerable resources for generating a profoundly  intense desire for cure. Sigerist has noted that Egyptian medicine probably  universalized the Eastern experience of parasitic diseases by combining it with  the idea of disease-possession: throwing up worms means being restored to  health [107,102]! Disease enters and leaves man as through a door.  A vulgar hierarchy of diseases still exists today, based on the extent to  which symptoms can -or cannot -be readily localized, hence Parkinson's  disease is more of a disease than thoracic shingles, which is, in turn, more so  than boils. Without wishing to detract from the grandeur of Pasteur's tenets,  we can say without hesitation that the germ theory of contagious disease has  certainly owed much of its success to the fact that it embodies an ontolOgical  representation of sickness. After all, a germ can be seen, even if this requires  the complicated mediation of a microscope, stains, and cultures, while we  would never be able to see a miasma or an influence. To see an entity is al­ ready to foresee an action. No one will object to the optimistic character of  the theories of infection insofar as their therapeutic application is concerned.  But the discovery of toxins and the recognition of the specific and individual  pathogenic role of terrains have destroyed the beautiful simplicity of a doc­ trine whose scientific veneer for a long time hid the persistence of a reaction  to disease as old as man himself. [For terrain, see glossary -Tr.]  If we feel the need to reassure ourselves, itis because one anguish constant­ ly haunts our thoughts; if we delegate the task of restoring the diseased organ­ ism to the desired norm to technical means, either magical or matter of fact  [positive] it is because we expect nothing good from nature itself.  By contrast, Greek medicine, in the Hippocratic writings and practices,  11 </p><div id="pagenum"><p>30</p></div><p id="page">12 PART ONE  offers a conception of disease which is no longer ontological, but dynamic, no  longer localizationist, but totalizing. Nature (physis), within man as well as  without, is harmony and equilibrium. The disturbance of this harmony, of  this equilibrium, is called disease. In this case, disease is not somewhere in  man, it is everywhere in him; it is the whole man. External circumstances are  the occasion but not the causes. Man's equilibrium consists of four humors,  whose fluidity is perfectly suited to sustain variations and oscillations and  whose qualities are paired by opposites (hot, cold, wet, dry); the disturbance  of these humors causes disease. But disease is not simply disequilibrium or  discordance; it is, and perhaps most important, an effort on the part of nature  to effect a new equilibrium in man. Disease is a generalized reaction designed  to bring about a cure; the organism develops a disease in order to get well.  Therapy must first tolerate and if necessary, reinforce these hedonic and  spontaneously therapeutic reactions. Medical technique imitates natural medi­ cinal action (vis medicatrix naturae). To imitate is not merely to copy an  appearance: but to mimic a tendency and to extend an intimate movement.  Of course, such a conception is also optimistic, but here the optimism con­ cerns the way of nature and not the effect of human technique.  Medical thought has never stopped alternating between these two repre­ sentations of disease, between these two kinds of optimism, always finding  some good reason for one or the other attitude in a newly explained patho­ genesis. Deficiency diseases and all infectious or parasitic diseases favor the  ontological theory, while endocrine disturbances and all diseases beginning  with dys support the dynamic or functional theory. However, these two con­ ceptions do have one point in common: in disease, or better, in the experience  of being sick, both envision a polemical situation: either a battle between the  organism and a foreign substance, or an internal struggle between opposing  forces. Disease differs from a state of health, the pathological from the nor­ mal, as one quality differs from another, either by the presence or absence of  a definite principle, or by an alteration of the total organism. This hetero­ geneity of normal and pathological states persists today in the naturalist  conception, which expects little from human efforts to restore the norm, and  in which nature will find the ways toward cure. But it proved difficult to  maintain the qualitative modification separating the normal from the patholo­ gical in a conception which allows, indeed expects, man to be able to compel  nature and bend it to his normative desires. Wasn't it said repeatedly after  Bacon's time that one governs nature only by obeying it? To govern disease  means to become acquainted with its relations with the normal state, which  the living man -loving life - wants to regain. Hence the theoretical need, but </p><div id="pagenum"><p>31</p></div><p id="page">INTRODUCTION TO THE PROBLEM 13  a past due technique, to establish a scientific pathology by linking it to phy­ siology. Thomas Sydenham (1624-1689) thought that in order to help a sick  man, his sickness had to be delimited and determined. There are disease  species just as there are animal or plant species. According to Sydenham there  is an order among diseases similar to the regularity I. Geoffroy Saint-Hilaire  found among anomalies. Pinel justified all these attempts at classification of  disease [nosology] by perfecting the genre in his Nosographie philosophique  (1797), which Daremberg described as more the work of a naturalist than a  clinician [29,1201].  Meanwhile, Morgagni's (1682-1771) creation of a system of pathological  anatomy made it possible to link the lesions of certain organs to groups of  stable symptoms, such that nosographical classification found a substratum in  anatomical analysis. But just as the followers of Harvey and Haller 'breathed  life' into anatomy by turning it into physiology, so pathology became a natural  extension of physiology. (Sigerist provides a masterful summary of this evolu­ tion of medical ideas: see 107: 117-142). The end result of this evolutionary  process is the formation of a theory of the relations between the normal and  the pathological, according to which the pathological phenomena found in  living organisms are nothing more than quantitative variations, greater or lesser  according to corresponding physiological phenomena. Semantically, the path­ ological is designated as departing from the normal not so much by a or dys as  by hyper or hypo. While retaining the ontological theory'sosoothing confidence  in the possibility of technical conquest of disease, this approach is far from  considering health and sickness as qualitatively opposed, or as forces joined in  battle. The need to reestablish continuity in order to gain more knowledge for  more effective action is such that the concept of disease would finally vanish.  The conviction that one can scientifically restore the norm is such that in the  end it annuls the pathological. Disease is no longer the object of anguish for  the healthy man; it has become instead the object of study for the theoretist  of health. It is in pathology, writ large, that we can unravel the teachings of  health, rather as Plato sought in the institutions of the State the larger and  more easily readable equivalent of the virtues and vices of the individual soul.  In the course of the nineteenth century, the real identity of normal and path­ ological vital phenomena, apparently so different, and given opposing values  by human experience, became a kind of SCientifically guaranteed dogma,  whose extension into the realms of philosophy and psychology appeared to  be dictated by the authority biologists and physicians accorded to it. This  dogma was expounded in France by Auguste Comte and Claude Bernard, </p><div id="pagenum"><p>32</p></div><p id="page">14 PART ONE  each working under very different circumstances and with very different  intentions. In Comte's doctrine, the dogma is based on an idea taken (with  explicit and respectful thanks) from Broussais. In Claude Bernard it is the  conclusion drawn from an entire lifetime of biological experimentation, the  practice of which is methodically codified in the famous Introduction a  !'etude de la medecine experimentale. In Comte's thought interest moves  from the pathological to the normal, with a view to determining speculatively  the laws of the normal; for it is as a substitute for biological experimentation  -often impracticable, particularly on man -that disease seems worthy of  systematic study. The identity of the normal and the pathological is asserted  as a gain in knowledge of the normal. Bernard's interest moves from the nor­ mal to the pathological with a view toward rational action directed at the  pathological; for it is as the foundation of an emphatically non-empirical  therapeutics that knowledge of disease is sought by means of physiology and  deriving from it. The identity of the normal and the pathological is asserted  as a gain in remedying the patholOgical. Finally, in Comte the assertion of  identity remains purely conceptual, while Claude Bernard tries to make this  identity precise in a quantitative, numerical interpretation.  In calling such a theory a dogma we do not mean at all to disparage it, but  rather to stress its scope and repercussions. Nor is it at all by chance that we  decided to look to Comte and Bernard for the texts that determined its  meaning. The influence of these two writers on nineteenth century philoso­ phy and science, and perhaps even more on literature, is considerable. It is  well established that physicians are more willing to look for the philosophy  of their art in literature than in medicine or philosophy themselves. Reading  Uttre, Renan, and Taine has certainly inspired more medical careers than  reading Richerand or Trousseau: it is a fact to be reckoned with that people  generally enter medicine completely ignorant of medical theOries, but not  without preconceived notions about many medical concepts. The dissemina­ tion of Comte's ideas in medical, scientific and literary circles was the work  of Uttre and Charles Robin, first incumbent of the chair of histology at the  Faculty of Medicine in Paris. 2 Their influence is felt most of all in the field of  psychology. From Renan we learn:  In studying the psychology of the individual, sleep, madness, delirium, somnambulism,  hallucination offer a far more favorable field of experience than the normal state.  Phenomena, which in the normal state are almost effaced because of their tenuousness,  appear more palpable in extraordinary crises because they are exaggerated. The physicist  does not study galvanism in the weak quantities found in nature, but increases it, by  means of experimentation, in order to study it more easily, although the laws studied in </p><div id="pagenum"><p>33</p></div><p id="page">INTRODUCTION TO THE PROBLEM 15  that exaggerated state are identical to those of the natural state. Similarly human psy­ chology will have to be constructed by studying the madness of mankind, the dreams  and hallucinations to be found on every page of the history of the human spirit [99,84].  L. Dugas, in his study of Ribot, clearly showed the relationship between  Ribot's methodological views and the ideas of Comte and Renan, his friend  and protector [37,21 and 68] :  Physiology and pathology, both physical and psychological, do not stand in contrast to  each other as two opposites, but rather as two parts of the same whole .... The patho­ logical method tends simultaneously toward pure observation and experimentation. It  is a powerful means of investigation which has been rich in results. Disease is, in effect,  an experiment of the most subtle order, instituted by nature itself in very precise cir­ cumstances by means unavailable to human skill: nature reaches the inaccessible [l00].  Claude Bernard's influence on physicians between 1870 and 1914 is equally  broad and deep, both directly through physiology and indirectly through liter­ ature, as established by the works of Lamy and Donald-King on the relations  between literary naturalism and nineteenth century biological and medical  doctrines [68 and 34]. Nietzsche borrowed from Claude Bernard precisely the  idea that the pathological is homogeneous with the normal. Quoting a long  passage on health and sickness taken from Let;ons sur la chaleur animale ['Lec­ tures on animal heat'],3 Nietzsche precedes it with the following statement:  It is the value of all morbid states that they show us under a magnifying glass certain  states that are normal -but not easily visible when normal. -[The Will to Power, No.  47. Translated by Walter Kaufmann and R. J. Hollingdale. New York, Vintage Books,  1968.]  These summary indications must suffice to show that the thesis whose  meaning and importance we are trying to derme has not been invented for the  sake of the cause. The history of ideas cannot be superimposed perforce on  the history of science. But as scientists lead their lives as men in an environ­ ment and social setting that is not exclusively scientific, the history of science  carmot neglect the history of ideas. In following a thesis to its logical conclu­ sion, it could be said that the modifications it undergoes in its cultural milieu  can reveal its essential meaning.  We chose to center our exposition around Comte and Claude Bernard  because these writers really played the role, half-voluntarily, of standard­ bearer; hence the preference given them over so many others, who are cited  to an equal extent and who could have been more vividly explained from  one or another point of view. 4 For precisely the opposite reason, we decided  to add the exposition of Leriche's ideas to that of Comte's and Bernard's. </p><div id="pagenum"><p>34</p></div><p id="page">16 PART ONE  Leriche is discussed as much in medicine as in physiology -not the least of  his merits. But it is possible that an examination of his ideas from an histori­ cal perspective will reveal unsuspected depth and significance. Without suc­ cumbing to a cult of authority, we cannot deny an eminent practitioner a  competence in pathology excelling that of Comte and Claude Bernard. More­ over, as far as the problems examined here are concerned, it is not without  interest that Leriche presently occupies the chair of medicine at the College  de France made famous by Claude Bernard himself. Thus, the differences  between them are only the more meaningful and valuable. </p><div id="pagenum"><p>35</p></div><p id="page">II  AUGUSTE COMTE AND 'BROUSSAIS'S PRINCIPLE'  Auguste Comte asserted the real identity of pathological phenomena and the  corresponding physiological phenomena at three principal stages of his intel­ lectual development: first, in the period leading up to the Corm de philoso­ phie positive, characterized, at the beginning, by his friendship with Saint­ Simon, with whom he severed relations in 1824;5 second, the actual period of  the positive philosophy; and third, the period of the Systeme de politique  positive, which, in certain respects, is very different from the preceding one.  Comte gave what he called Broussais's principle universal significance in the  order of biological, psychological, and sociological phenomena.  It was in 1828 that Comte took notice of Broussais's treatise De l'irritation  et de la folie ['On Irritation and Madness'] and adopted the principle for his  own use. Comte credits Broussais, rather than Bichat, and before him, Pinel,  with having declared that all diseases acknowledged as such are only symp­ toms and that disturbances of vital functions could not take place without  lesions in organs, or rather, tissues. But above all, adds Comte, "never before  had anyone conceived the fundamental relation between pathology and phy­ siology in so direct and satisfying a manner". Broussais described all diseases  as consisting essentially "in the excess or lack of excitation in the various  tissues above or below the degree established as the norm". Thus diseases are  merely the effects of simple changes in intensity in the action of the stimu­ lants which are indispensable for maintaining health.  From then on Comte raised Broussais's nosological conception to the level  of a general axiom. It would not be exaggerating to say that he accorded it  the same dogmatic value as Newton's law or d'Alembert's principle. Certainly  when he tried to link his fundamental sociological principle, "progress is  nothing but the development of order", to some other more general principle  which could verify it, Comte hesitated between Broussais's authority and  d'Alembert's. He refers sometimes to d'Alembert's reduction of the laws of  the propagation of movement to the laws of equilibrium [28, I, 490-94] ,  sometimes to Broussais's aphorism. The positive theory of the changeability  of phenomena  is completely reduced to this universal principle and results from the systematic applica- 17 </p><div id="pagenum"><p>36</p></div><p id="page">18 PART ONE  tion of Broussais's great aphorism: every modification -whether natural or artificial - of the real order concerns only the intensity of the corresponding phenomena ..• ;  despite variations in degree, phenomena always retain the same arrangement; every  change in the actual nature, that is, class, of an object is recognized moreover as being  contradictory (28,111, 71].  Little by little Comte practically claimed the intellectual paternity of this  principle for himself by virtue of the fact that he applied it systematically,  exactly as he at first thought that Broussais, having borrowed the principle  from Brown, was able to claim it for himself because of the personal use he  had made of it [28, IV, App. 223]. Here we must quote a rather long passage  which would be weakened if summarized:  In the case of living beings, the judicious observation of diseases forms a series of indirect  experiments which is much more suitable than most direct experiments to. throw light on  explaining dynamic and even statistical notions. My philosophical Treatise did much to  commend the nature and scope of such a procedure which leads to truly important gains  in biology. It rests on the great principle, whose discovery I attribute to Broussais as it  derives from the sum total of his works, although I alone constructed the general and  direct formula. Until Broussais, the pathological state obeyed laws completely different  from those governing the normal state, so that the exploration of one coul;i have no  effect on the other. Broussais established that the phenomena of disease coincided essen­ tially with those of health from which they differed only in terms of intensity. This  brilliant principle has become the basis of pathology, thus subordinated to the whole of  biology. Applied in the opposite sense it explains and improves the great capacity of  pathological analysis for throwing light on biological speculations ..•. The insights  already gained from it can only give a faint idea of its ultimate efficacy. Those engaged  in the encyclopedic task of compiling and classifying knowledge will extend Broussais's  principle primarily to moral and intellectual activities where it has not yet received a  worthy application, hence their diseases surprise or move us without instructing us ....  In the general system of positive education, besides its direct usefulness for biological  problems, this principle will be an appropriate logical preparation for analogous proce­ dures in any science. The collective organism, because of its greater degree of com­ plexity, has problems more serious, varied, and frequent than those of the individual  organism. I do not hesitate to state that Broussais's principle must be extended to this  point and I have often applied it to conflIm or perfect sociological laws. But the analysis  of revolutions could not illuminate the positive study of society without the logical  initiation resulting, in this respect, from the simplest cases presented by biology (28, I,  651-53].  Here then is a, principle of nosology vested with a universal authority  that embraces the political order. Moreover, it goes without saying that  it is this last projected application which confers the principle with all the  value of which it is already capable, according to Comte, in the biological  order. </p><div id="pagenum"><p>37</p></div><p id="page">AUGUSTE COMTE AND 'BROUSSAIS'S PRINCIPLE' 19  The fortieth lecture of the Cours de philosophie positive -philosophical  reflections on the whole of biology -contains Comte's most complete text  on the problem now before us. It is concerned with showing the difficulties  inherent in the simple extension of experimental methods, which have proved  their usefulness in the physico-chemical sphere, to the particular characteris­ tics of the living:  Any experiment whatever is always designed to uncover the laws by which each deter­ mining or modifying influence of a phenomenon effects its performance, and it generally  consists in in1roducing a clear-cut change into each designated condition in order to  measure directly the corresponding variation of the phenomenon itself [27,169].  Now, in biology the variation imposed on one or several of a phenomenon's  conditions of existence cannot be random but must be contained within  certain limits compatible with the phenomenon's existence. Furthermore, the  fact of functional consensus proper to the organism precludes monitoring the  relation, which links a determined disturbance to its supposedly exclusive  effects, with sufficient analytical precision. But, thinks Comte, if we readily  admit that the essence of experimentation lies not in the researcher's artificial  intervention in the system of a phenomenon which he intentionally tends to  disturb, but rather in the comparison between a control phenomenon and one  altered with respect to anyone of its conditions of existence, it follows that  diseases must be able to function for the scientists as spontaneous experi­ ments which allow a comparison to be made between an organism's various  abnormal states and its normal state.  According to the eminently philosophical principle which will serve from now on as a  direct, general basis for positive pathology and whose definitive establishment we owe to  the bold and perservering genius of our famous fellow citizen, Broussais, the pathological  state is not at all radically different from the physiological state, with regard to which  -no matter how one looks at it -it can only constitute a simple extension going more  or less beyond the higher or lower limits of variation proper to each phenomenon of the  normal organism, without ever being able to produce really new phenomena which  would have to a certain degree any purely physiological analogues [27,175].  Consequently every conception of pathology must be based on prior knowl­ edge of the corresponding normal state, but conversely the scientific study of  pathological cases becomes an indispensable phase in the overall search for  the laws of the normal state. The observation of patholOgical cases offers  numerous, genuine advantages for actual experimental investigation. The  transition from the normal to the abnormal is slower and more natural in the  case of illness, and the return to normal, when it takes place, spontaneously </p><div id="pagenum"><p>38</p></div><p id="page">20 PART ONE  furnishes a verifying counterproof. In addition, as far as man is concerned,  pathological investigation is more fruitful than the necessarily limited experi­ mental exploration. The scientific study of morbid states is essentially valid  for all organisms, even plant life, and is particularly suited to the most com­ plex and therefore the most delicate and fragile phenomena which direct  experimentation, being too brusque a disturbance, would tend to distort.  Here Comte was thinking of vital phenomena related to the higher animals  and man, of the nervous and psychic functions. Finally, the study of anom­ alies and monstrosities conceived as both older and less curable illnesses than  the functional disturbances of various plant or neuromotor apparatuses com­ pletes the study of diseases: the 'teratological approach' [study of monsters]  is added to the 'pathological approach' in biological investigation [27,179] .  It is appropriate to note, first, the particularly abstract quality of this  thesis and the absence throughout of any precise example of a medical nature  to suitably illustrate his literal exposition. Since we cannot relate these gen­ eral propositions to any example, we do not know from what vantage point  Comte states that the pathological phenomenon always has its analogue in a  physiological phenomenon, and that it is nothing radically new. How is a  sclerotic artery analogous to a normal one, or an asystolic heart identical to  that of an athlete at the height of his powers? Undoubtedly, we are meant to  understand that the laws of vital phenomena are the same for both disease  and health. But then why not say so and give examples? And even then, does  this,not imply that analogous effects are determined in health and disease by  analogous mechanisms? We should think about this example given by Sigerist:  During digestion the number of white blood cells increases. The same is true at the onset  of infection. Consequently this phenomenon is sometimes physiological, sometimes  pathological, depending on what causes it [107, 109].  Secondly it should be pointed out that despite the reciprocal nature of the  clarification achieved through the comparison of the normal with the patho­ logical and the assimilation of the pathological and the-normal, Comte insists  repeatedly on the necessity of determining the normal and its true limits of  variation first, before methodically investigating pathological cases. Strictly  speaking, knowledge of normal phenomena, based solely on observation, is  both possible and necessary without knowledge of disease, particularly that  based on experimentation. But we are presented with a serious gap in that  Comte provides no criterion which would allow us to know what a normal  phenomenon is. We are left to conclude that on this point he is referring to  the usual corresponding concept, given the fact that he uses the notions of </p><div id="pagenum"><p>39</p></div><p id="page">AUGUSTE COMTE AND 'BROUSSAIS'S PRINCIPLE' 21  normal state, physiological state and natural state interchangeably [27,175,  176] . Better still, when it comes to deftning the limits of pathological or ex­ perimental disturbances compatible with the existence of organisms, Comte  identiftes these limits with those of a "harmony of distinct influences, those  exterior as well as interior" [27, 169]. With the result that the concept of  the normal or physiological, ftnally clarifted by this concept of harmony,  amounts to a qualitative and polyvalent concept, still more aesthetic and  moral than scientiftc.  As far as the assertion of identity of the normal phenomenon and the  corresponding pathological phenomenon is concerned, it is equally clear that  Comte's intention is to deny the qualitative difference between these two  admitted by the vitalists. Logically to deny a qualitative difference must lead  to asserting a homogeneity capable of expression in quantitative terms.  Comte is undoubtedly heading toward this when he deftnes pathology as a  "simple extension going more or less beyond the higher or lower limits of  variation proper to each phenomenon of the normal organism". But in the  end it must be recognized that the terms used here, although only vaguely  and loosely quantitative, still have a qualitative ring to them. Comte took  from Broussais this vocabulary which fails to express what he wanted, and so  it is to Broussais that we return in order to understand the uncertainties and  gaps in Comte's exposition.  We prefer to base our summary of Broussais's theory on his treatise De I'irri­ tation et de la folie, since, of all his works, this is the one Comte knew best.  We have been able to determine that neither the Traite de physioiogie appli­ quee a la pathoiogie ['Treatise on Philosophy Applied to Pathology'] nor the  Catechisme de medecine physiologique formulates this theory any more clear­ ly or differently.6 Broussais saw the vital primordial fact in excitation. Man  exists only through the excitation exercised on his organs by the environment  in which he is compelled to live. Through their innervation both the internal  and external surfaces of contact transmit this excitation to the brain which  sends it back to all the tissues including the surfaces of contact. These sur­ faces are exposed to two kinds of excitation: foreign bodies and the influence  of the brain. It is under the continuous action of these multiple sources of  excitation that life is sustained. Applying the physiological doctrine to patho­ logy means trying to ftnd out how "this excitation can deviate from the  normal state and constitute an abnormal or diseased state" [18,263]. These  deviations are either deficiencies or excesses. Irritation differs from excitation  only in terms of degree; it can be defined as the ensemble of disturbances </p><div id="pagenum"><p>40</p></div><p id="page">22 PART ONE  "produced in the economy by agents which make vital phenomena more or  less pronounced than they are in the normal state" [18,267]. Irritation is  thus "normal excitation transformed by its excess" [18,300]. For example,  through lack of oxygen, asphyxia deprives the lungs of its normal excitant.  Inversely, air with too high an oxygen content "overexcites the lungs so much  more strongly that the organ is more excitable and inflammation is the result"  [18,282]. The two deviations, brought about by deficiency or excess, do not  have the same importance in pathology, the latter considerably outweighing  the former: "This second source of disease, the excess of excitation converted  into irritation is thus much richer than the first, the lack of excitation, and it  can be stated that most of our ills stem from this second source" [18,286].  In using them interchangeably, Broussais equates the terms abnormal, patho­ logical, and morbid [18,263,287,315]. The distinction between the normal  or physiological and the abnormal or pathological would then be a simple  quantitative one limited to the terms of deficiency and excess. And once  Broussais admitted the physiological theory of the intellectual faculties, this  distinction is valid for mental as well as organic phenomena [18,440]. This,  then, in summary is the thesis whose fortune certainly owes more to the per­ sonality of the author than to the coherence of his text.  To begin with, in his definition of the pathological state, Broussais ob­ viously confuses cause and effect. A cause can vary quantitatively so that it  nevertheless both continues and provokes qualitatively different effects. To  take a simple example, a quantitatively increased excitation can bring about  a pleasant state, soon followed by pain, two feelings no one would want to  confuse. In such a theory two points of view are being constantly mixed  together, that of the sick man who is experiencing his illness and who is tested  by it, and that of the scientist who fmds nothing in disease that cannot be  explained by physiology. But the states of an organism are like those found  in music: the laws of acoustics are not broken in cacophony -this does not  mean that all combinations of sounds are agreeable.  In short, such a conception can be developed in two slightly different  directions, depending on whether the relation established between the normal  and the pathological is one of homogeneity or continuity. Begin, a strictly  obedient disciple, adheres particularly to the relation of continuity:  Pathology is no more than a branch, a result, a complement of physiology, or rather,  physiology embraces the study of vital actions at all stages of the existence of living  things. Without noticing, we pass from one to the other of these sciences as we examine  functions from the moment the organs are performing with all the regularity and uni­ formity of which they are capable, to the point when the lesions are so serious that all </p><div id="pagenum"><p>41</p></div><p id="page">AUGUSTE COMTE AND 'BROUSSAIS'S PRINCIPLE' 23  functions become impossible and all movement stops. Physiology and pathology clarify  each other. (3, XVIII).  But it must be said that the continuity of a transition between one state and  another can certainly be compatible with the heterogeneity of these states.  The continuity of the middle stages does not rule out the diversity of the  extremes. Broussais's own vocabulary sometimes betrays his difficulty in sus­ taining his assertion of a real homogeneity between normal and pathological  phenomena; for example: "diseases increase, decrease, interrupt, corrupt' the  innervation of the brain in terms of its instinctive, intellectual, sensitive and  muscular relations" [18, 144) ; and: "the irritation which develops in living  tissues does not always alte,s them in a manner that constitutes inflamma­ tion" [18,301). In the case of Comte, the vagueness of the notions of excess  and deficiency and their implicit qualitative and normative character is even  more noticeable, scarcely hidden under their metrical pretentions. Excess or  deficiency exist in relation to a scale deemed valid and suitable -hence in  relation to a norm. To define the abnormal as too much or too little is to  recognize the normative character of the so-called normal state. This normal  or physiological state is no longer simply a disposition which can be revealed  and explained as a fact, but a manifestation of an attachment to some value.  When Begin defines the normal state as one where "the organs function with  all the regularity and uniformity of which they are capable", we cannot fail  to recognize that, despite Broussais's horror of all ontology, an ideal of per­ fection soars over this attempt at a positive definition.  From here on one can outline the major objection to this thesis according  to which pathology is an extended or broadened physiology. The ambition  to make pathology, and consequently therapeutics, completely scientific by  simply making them derive from a previously established physiology would  make sense only if, first, the normal could be defined in a purely objective  way as a fact and second, all the differences between the normal state and the  pathological state could be expressed in quantitative terms, for only quantity  can take into account both homogeneity and variation. By questioning this  double possibility we do not intend to undervalue either physiology or patho­ logy. At any rate it must be evident that neither Broussais nor Comte fulfilled  the two requirements which seem inseparable from the attempt with which  their names are associated.  As far as Broussais is concerned this fact is not surprising. Methodical  thinking was not his strength. For him the theses of physiological medicine  were valuable less as speculative anticipation to justify painstaking research, </p><div id="pagenum"><p>42</p></div><p id="page">24 PART ONE  than as a therapeutic prescription, in the form of bloodletting, to be imposed  on everything and everyone. Armed with his lancet he aimed especially at  inflammation found in the general phenomenon of excitation which had been  transformed by its excess into irritation. As far as his teachings are concerned,  its incoherence must be attributed to the fact that they embody, without too  much care for their respective implications, the teachings of Xavier Bichat  and John Brown, about whom it would be appropriate to say a few words.  First a student, then a rival of Cullen (1712-1780), the Scottish physician  John Brown (1735-1788) had learned from his teacher about the notion  of irritability suggested by Glisson (1596-1677) and developed by Haller.  Author of the first great treatise on physiology (Elementa physi%giae,  1755-1766), Haller, a universal and gifted spirit, understood irritability to be  the tendency of certain organs, particularly the muscles, to respond to any  stimulus with a contraction. Contraction is not a mechanical phenomenon  analogous to elasticity; it is the specific response of muscular tissue to differ­ ent external stimuli [sollicitations]. By the same token, sensibility is the  specific property of nervous tissue [29,11; 13 bis, II; 107,51; 110].  According to Brown, life is sustained by means of one particular property  alone, excitability, which allows living organisms to be affected and to react.  In the form of either sthenia or asthenia, diseases are simply a quantitative  modification of this property wherever the excitation is either too strong or  too weak. 9  ... it has been proved that health and disease are the same state depending upon the  same cause, that is, excitement, varying only in degree; and that the powers producing  both are the same, sometimes acting with a proper degree of force, at other times either  with too much or too little; that the whole and sole province of a physician, is not to  look for morbid states and remedies which have no existence, but to consider the devia­ tion of excitement from the healthy standard, in order to remove it by the proper means  (pp. 78-79).  Dismissing both the solidists and the humOrists, Brown asserted that disease  depends not on the primitive flaw of solids or fluids, but solely on the varia­ tions of the intensity of the excitation. Treating diseases means adjusting the  amount of excitation to a greater or lesser degree. Charles Daremberg sum­ marized these ideas in the following way:  Brown took for his own and adapted to his own system a proposition I have called to  your attention several times in these lectures, namely that pathology is a province of  physiology, or as Broussais said, of pathological physiology. In fact, Brown asserts  (§ 65) that it has been fully proven that the state of health and that of disease are </p><div id="pagenum"><p>43</p></div><p id="page">AUGUSTE COMTE AND 'BROUSSAIS'S PRINCIPLE' 25  not different, for the very reason that the forces which produce or destroy both have  the same action; he tries to prove it, for example, by comparing muscle contraction and  spasms or tetanus (§ 57 et. seq.; cf. 136) (29,1132).  Without doubt what is particularly interesting in Brown's theory, as Darem­ berg notes repeatedly, is that it is the point of departure of Broussais's ideas,  but even more interesting is the fact that to a certain degree it has a vague  tendency to end up as a pathological phenomenon. Brown claimed to evalu­ ate numerically the variable disposition of the organs· to be excited:  Suppose the greater affection of a part (as the inflammation of the lungs in peripneu­ mony, the inflammation of the foot in the gout, the effusion of water into a general or  particular cavity in dropsy) to be as 6, and the lesser affection of every other part to be  3, and the number of the parts less affected to amount to 1000; then it will fonow, that  the ratio of affection, confmed to the part, to the affection of an the rest of the body,  will be as 6 to 3000. This estimate, or something very like to it, is proved by the effect  of the exciting hurtful powers, which always act upon the whole body; and by that of  the remedies, which always remove the effect of the hurtful powers from the whole  body, in every general disease (pp. 23-24).  Thereapeutics is based on calculation:  Suppose the sthenic diathesis mounted up to 60 in the scale; to reduce it to 40 it is evi­ dent, that the 20 degrees of superfluous excitement must be taken off, and therefore,  that remedies operating with a stimulus, weak enough to produce that effect, must be  employed ... (pp. 43-44 note).  Certainly we can and should smile at this caricature of the mathematization  of pathological phenomena but only on the condition that we agree that this  doctrine does meet in full the demands of its postulates and that its concepts  are completely coherent, something that is not true in Broussais.  Better still, a disciple of Brown, Samuel Lynch, in the same spirit con­ structed a scale of degrees of excitation, "a veritable thermometer of health  and disease", as Daremberg called it, in the form of a proportional Table  annexed to the various editions or translations of the Elementa medicinae.  This table has two parallel scales from 0 to 80 going in opposite directions so  that the niaximum of excitability (80) corresponds to '0' of excitation and  vice versa. Starting from perfect health (excitation = 40, excitability = 40)  and going in both directions, the various degrees on the scale correspond to  diseases, their causes, influences and treatments. For example, between 60  and 70 on the excitation scale are found the diseases of sthenic diathesis:  peripneumonia, brain fever, severe smallpox, severe measles, severe erysipelas  and rheumatism. For these the therapeutic indication is as follows: "In order </p><div id="pagenum"><p>44</p></div><p id="page">26 PART ONE  to effect a cure, excitation must be decreased. This is achieved by avoiding  overly strong stimuli, admitting only the weakest or negative stimuli. Cures  are bloodletting, purging, diet, inner peace, cold, etc."  It must be said that this disinterment of an obsolete nosology was not  intended to amuse or to satisfy the vain curiosity of a scholar. In a unique  way it approaches a precise statement of the profound sense of the thesis  now before us. Logically speaking, it is quite correct that an identification of  phenomena, whose qualitative differences are considered illusory, takes the  form of a quantification. Here the form of metrical identification is simply a  caricature. But often a caricature reveals the essence of a form better than a  faithful copy. It is true that Brown and Lynch succeeded only in construc­ ting a conceptual hierarchy of patholOgical phenomena, a qualitative device to  mark the state between the two extremes of health and illness. Marking is not  measuring, a mark [degrel is not a cardinal unit. But even the error is instruc­ tive; it most certainly reveals the theoretical Significance of one attempt, as  well as the limits encountered in the object itself on which the attempt was  made. to*  If we admit that Broussais was able to learn from Brown that, some quantita­ tive variations apart, the assertion of the identity of normal and pathological  phenomena logically means superimposing a system of measurement on  research, what he learned from Bichat certainly counterbalanced that influ­ ence. In his Recherches sur la vie et la mort ['Research on Life and Death']  (1800), Bichat contrasts the object and methods of physiology with the  object and methods of physics. According to him, instability and irregularity  are the essential characteristics of vital phenomena, such that forcing them  into a rigid framework of metrical relations distorts their nature [12, art. 7  § I]. It was from Bichat that Comte and even Claude Bernard took their  systematic distrust of any mathematical treatment of biological facts, parti­ cularly any research dealing with averages and statistical calculations.  Bichat's hostility toward all metrical designs in biology was paradoxically  allied with his assertion that diseases must be explained in terms of the de­ finitely quantitative variations of their properties, with the tissues which  make up the organs serving as a scale.  To analyse precisely the. properties of living bodies; to show that every physiological  phenomenon is, in the final analysis, related to these properties considered in their  natural state and that every pathological phenomenon derives from their increase,  decrease, or alteration, that every therapeutic phenomenon has as its principle the  return to the natural type from which they had deviated; to determine precisely the </p><div id="pagenum"><p>45</p></div><p id="page">AUGUSTE COMTE AND 'BROUSSAIS'S PRINCIPLE' 27  cases where each one comes into play ... this is the general idea of this work [13, I,  XIX).  Here is the source of that ambiguity of ideas which we have already criticized  in Broussais and Comte. Augmentation and diminution are concepts which  connote quantity, but alteration is a concept of qualitative force. One cannot,  of course, blame physiologists and physicians for falling into that trap of the  Same and the Other into which so many philosophers have fallen since Plato.  But it is good to be able to recognize the trap and not blithely ignore it just  when one is caught. All of Broussais's teachings are contained in embryo in  this proposition of Bichat:  All curative resources have only one goal, to return altered vital properties to their  natural state. All means which fail to diminish the increased organic sensibility in inflam­ mation, which do not increase the completely diminished property in edemas, infIltra­ tion, etc., which do not lower animal contractility in convulsions and do not raise it in  paralysis, etc., essentially miss their goal; they are contra-indicated. [13, I, 12).  The only difference is that Broussais reduced all pathogeny to a phenomenon  of increase and excess and consequently all therapy to blood-letting. Here it is  certainly true to say that excess in everything is a defect!  It may be surprising to see that an exposition of Comte's theory has turned  into a pretext for a retrospective study. Why wasn't a chronological order  employed at the outset? Because a historical narrative always reverses the  true order of interest and inquiry. It is in the present that problems provoke  reflection. And if reflection leads to a regression, the regression is necessarily  related to it. Thus the historical origin is really less important than the re­ flective origin. Certainly Bichat, the founder of histology, owes nothing to  Comte. It is not even certain that the resistance encountered by the cellular  theory in France is really broadly related to Charles Robin's positivist loyal­ ties. It is known that Comte, following Bichat, did not admit that analysis  could go beyond tissues [64]. What is certain in any case is that even in the  milieu of medical culture, the theories of general pathology originated by  Bichat, Brown, and Broussais were influential only to the extent that Comte  found them advantageous. The physicians of the second half of the nineteenth  century were for the most part ignorant of Broussais and Brown, but few  were unaware of Comte or Littre; just as today most physiologists cannot  ignore Bernard, but disregard Bichat to whom Bernard is connected through  Magendie.  By going back to the more remote sources of Comte's ideas -through the </p><div id="pagenum"><p>46</p></div><p id="page">28 PART ONE  pathology of Broussais, Brown, and Bichat -we put ourselves in a better  position to understand their significance and limits. We know that it was from  Bichat (through the intermediary of his teacher in physiology, de Blainville)  that Comte acquired a decided hostility toward all mathematization of bio­ logy. He accounts for this at great length in the 40th lecture of the COUTS de  philosophie positive. That influence of Bichat's vitalism on the Comtean  positivist conception of vital phenomena, however discreet, balances the  profound logical requirements of the assertion of the identity between phy­ siological and pathological mechanisms, requirements moreover ignored by  Broussais, another intermediary between Comte and Bichat on one precise  point of pathological doctrine.  One must bear in mind that Comte's aims and intentions are very different  from Broussais's, or rather, different from Broussais's intellectual antecedents,  when he develops the same conceptions in pathology. On the one hand  Comte claims to be codifying scientific methods, on the other, to be estab­ lishing a political doctrine scientifically. By stating in a general way that  diseases do not change vital phenomena, Comte is justified in stating that the  cure for political crises consists in bringing societies back to their essential  and permanent structure, and tolerating progress only within limits of varia­ tion of the natural order defined by social statics. In positivist doctrine,  Broussais's principle remains an idea subordinated to a system, and it is the  physicians, psychologists, and men of letters, positivist by inspiration and  tradition, who disseminated it as an independent conception. </p><div id="pagenum"><p>47</p></div><p id="page">III  CLAUDE BERNARD AND EXPERIMENTAL PATHOLOGY  It is certain that Claude Bernard never referred to Comte while dealing with  the problem of the relationship between the normal and the pathological,  although he did solve it in an apparently similar fashion; it is equally certain  that he could not ignore Comte's opinions. We know that Claude Bernard  read Comte closely, and with pen in hand, as borne out by notes dating pro­ bably from 1865-66, and published in 1938 by Jacques Chevalier [11]. For  the phYSicians and biologists of the Second Empire, Magendie, Comte, and  Claude Bernard are three gods -or three devils -of the same religion. In  examining the experimental work of Bernard's teacher, Magendie, Littre  analyses those postulates which coincide with Comte's ideas on experimenta­ tion in biology and its relation to the observation of pathological phenomena  [78, 162]. E. Gley was the first to show that Claude Bernard, in his article,  'Progres des sciences physiologiques' (Revue des Deux Mondes, 1 August  1865) took for his own the law of the three states, and that he had a part in  publications and associations in which Charles Robin made the positivist  influence felt [44,164-170]. In 1864, together with Brown-Sequard, Robin  published the Journal de l'anatomie et de la physiologie normales et patho­ logiques de l'homme et des animaux: reports of Bernard, Chevreul, etc.  appeared in the first issues. Bernard was the second president of the Societe  de Biologie which Robin had founded in 1848, whose guiding principles were  formulated in a lecture to the charter members:  By studying anatomy and the classification of living beings, we hope to clarify the  mechanism of functions; by studying physiology, to come to know how organs can be  changed and within what limits functions deviate from the normal [44,166].  For his part, Lamy has shown that, in practice, nineteenth century artists and  writers, who looked for sources of inspiration or themes to reflect upon in  physiology and medicine, did not distinguish between the ideas of Comte and  those of Bernard [68].  Having said that, we must add that it is really a very difficult and delicate  task to outline Claude Bernard's ideas on the precise problem of the nature  and meaning of pathological phenomena. Here is a scientist of note whose dis­ coveries and methods still bear fruit today, to whom physicians and biologists  29 </p><div id="pagenum"><p>48</p></div><p id="page">30 PART ONE  refer constantly, and for whose works there is no complete critical edition!  Most of th~ lectures given at the College de France were edited and published  by students. But that which Bernard himself did write, his correspondence,  has not been the object of any fair, methodical investigation. Notes and note­ books have been published here and there and have immediately become the  center of controversy so expressly tendentious that one wonders whether the  same insinuations, which are moreover quite varied, did not actually provoke  the publication of all these fragments. Bernard's thought remains a problem.  The only honest solution will be the systematic publication of his papers and,  when this decision is finally reached, the placing of his papers in an archive. ll  In Bernard's work, the real identity -should one say in mechanisms or symp­ toms or both? -and continuity of pathological phenomena and the corre­ sponding physiological phenomena are more a monotonous repetition than a  theme. This assertion is to be found in the Le~ons de physiologie experi­ mentale .appliquee a la medecine ['Lectures on Experimental Physiology  Applied to Medicine'] (1855), especially in the second and twenty-second  lectures of Vol. II, and in the Le~ons sur la chaleur animale ['Lectures on  Animal Heat'] (1876). We prefer to choose the Lef;ons sur Ie diabete et la  glycogenese animale ['Lectures on Diabetes and Animal Glycogenesis'] (1877)  as the basic text, which, of all Bernard's works, can be considered the one  especially devoted to illustrating the theory, the one where clinical and ex­ perimental facts are presented at least as much for the 'moral' of a methodo­ logical and philosophical order which can be drawn from it, as for their in­ trinsic physiological meaning.  Bernard considered medicine as the science of diseases, physiology as the  science of life. In the sciences it is theory which illuminates and dominates  practice. Rational therapeutics can be sustained only by a scientific patho­ logy, and a scientific pathology must be based on physiological science.  Diabetes is one disease which poses problems whose solution proves the  preceding thesis.  Common sense shows that if we are thoroughly acquainted with a physiological phe­ nomenon, we should be in a position to account for all the disturbances to which it is  susceptible in the pathological state: Physiology and pathology are intermingled and  are essentially one and the same thing [9, 56] .  Diabetes is a disease which consists solely and entirely in the disorder of a  normal function.  Every disease has a corresponding normal function of which it is only the disturbed, </p><div id="pagenum"><p>49</p></div><p id="page">CLAUDE BERNARD AND EXPERIMENTAL PATHOLOGY 31  exaggerated, diminished or obliterated expression. If we are unable to explain all mani­ festations of disease today, it is because physiology is not yet sufficiently advanced and  there are still many normal functions unknown to us [9,56).  In this Bernard was opposed to many physiologists of his day, according to  whom disease was an extra-physiological entity, superimposed on the organ­ ism. The study of diabetes no longer allowed such an opinion.  In effect diabetes is characterized by the following symptoms: polyuria, polydipsia,  polyphagia, autophagia, and glycosuria. Strictly speaking, none of these symptoms  represents a new phenomenon, unknown to the normal state, nor is any a spontaneous  production of nature. On the contrary all of them preexist, save for their intensity  which varies in the normal state and in the diseased state [9,65-66).  It is easy to demonstrate this as far as polyuria, polydipsia, polyphagia, and  autophagia are concerned, less easy with regard to glycosuria. But Bernard  contended that glycosuria is a 'masked and unnoticed" phenomenon in the  normal state and that only its exaggeration makes it apparent [9, 67]. In  reality Bernard does not effectively prove what he is propounding. In the six­ teenth lecture, after comparing the opinions of physiologists, who assert the  constant presence of sugar in normal urine, with that of those who deny it,  after having shown the difficulty of experiments and of their control, Bernard  adds that in the normal urine of an animal fed on nitrogenized substances and  deprived of sugar and starches, he never succeeded in uncovering the faintest  traces of sugar, but that it would be completely different with an animal fed  on excessive amounts of sugar and starches. It is equally natural to think, he  says, that in the course of its oscillations, glycemia can determine the passage  of sugar in the urine.  In sum, I do not believe that this proposition can be formulated as an absolute truth:  there is sugar in normal urine. But I readily admit that there are many, many cases where  there are traces; there is a kind of transient glycosuria which here as everywhere estab­ lishes an imperceptible and elusive passage between the physiological and the pathologi­ cal states. I agree in other respects with clinicians in recognizing that the glycosuric  phenomenon has no real, well established pathological character until it becomes perma­ nent [9,390].  It is striking to document here that, in trying to furnish a particularly  convincing fact favoring his interpretation in a case where he felt especially  challenged, Bernard found himself forced to admit this same fact without  experimental proof -by reason of the theory -by supposing that its reality  was situated beyond the limits of sensibility of all the methods used at that  time for its detection. Today H. Fredlhicq admits on this very point that </p><div id="pagenum"><p>50</p></div><p id="page">32 PART ONE  there is no normal glycosuria, that in certain cases where a large amount of  liquid is ingested and there is copious diuresis, glucose cannot be reabsorbed  in the kidney at the level of the convoluted tube and is, so to speak, washed  away [40,353]. This explains why certain writers like Nolf can say that there  is a normal infinitesimal glycosuria [90,251]. If there is no glycosuria nor­ mally, what physiological phenomenon does diabetic glycosuria exaggerate  quantitatively?  Briefly, we know that Claude Bernard's genius lies in the fact that he  showed that the sugar found in an animal organism is a product of this same  organism and not just something introduced from the plant world through its  feeding; that blood normally contains sugar, and that urinary sugar is a pro­ duct generally eliminated by the kidneys when the rate of glycemia reaches a  certain threshold. In other words, glycemia is a constant phenomenon inde­ pendent of food intake to such an extent that it is the absence of blood sugar  that is abnormal, and glycosuria is the consequence of glycemia which has  risen above a certain quantity, serving as a threshold. In a diabetic, glycemia is  not in itself a pathological phenomenon -it is so only in terms of its quan­ tity; in itself, glycemia is a "normal and constant phenomenon in a healthy  organism" [9,181].  There is only one glycemia, it is constant, permanent, both during diabetes and outside  that morbid state. Only it has degrees: glycemia below 3 to4% does not lead to glyco­ suria; but above that level glycosuria results .... It is impossible to perceive the transi­ tion from the normal to the pathological state, and no problem shows better than  diabetes the intimate fusion of physiology and pathology [9,132).  The energy Bernard spent expounding his thesis does not seem superfluous  if the thesis is placed in a historical perspective. In 1866 Jaccoud, professor  agrege at the Faculty of Medicine in Paris dealt with diabetes in a clinical  lecture by saying that glycemia is an inconstant, pathological phenomenon  and that the production of sugar in the liver is, according to the work of Pavy,  a pathological phenomenon.  The diabetic state cannot be attributed to the overintensification of a physiological  operation which does not exist .... It is impossible to regard diabetes as the overintensi­ fication of a regular operation: it is the expression of an operation completely foreign to  normal life. This operation is in itself the essence of the disease [57,826).  In 1883, when Bernard's theory was more firmly established, Jaccoud, by  then professor of internal pathology, continued to maintain his objections in  his Traite de pathoiogie interne ['Treatise on Internal Pathology']: "The  transformation of glycogen into sugar is either a pathological or cadaverous </p><div id="pagenum"><p>51</p></div><p id="page">CLAUDE BERNARD AND EXPERIMENTAL PATHOLOGY 33  phenomenon" [58,945].  If we really want to understand the meaning and significance of the asser­ tion of continuity between normal and pathological phenomena, we must  bear in mind that the thesis toward which Bernard's critical demonstrations  are directed is one which admits a qualitative difference between the mecha­ nisms and products of the vital functions of the normal state and those of the  pathological state. This contradiction of theses appears perhaps more clearly  in the Ler;ons sur la chaleur animale ['Lectures on Animal Heat'] :  Health and disease are not two essentially different modes as the ancient physicians  believed and as some practitioners still believe. They should not be made into distinct  principles, entities which fight over the living organism and make it the theater of their  contest. These are obsolete medical ideas. In reality, between these two modes of being,  there are only differences of degree: exaggeration, disproportion, discordance of normal  phenomena constitute the diseased state. There is no case where disease would have  produced new conditions, a complete change of scene, some new and special products  (8,391).  To support this Bernard gives an example which he believes particularly suited  to ridicule the opinion he is fighting. After two Italian physiologists, Lussana  and Ambrossoli, repeated his experiments on the cutting of the sympathetic  nerve and its effects, they denied the physiological character of the heat  engendered by the vasodilatation of the effected organs. According to them,  this heat was morbid, different in every respect from physiological heat, the  latter originating from the combustion of food, the former from the combus­ tion of tissues. As if food, Bernard replied, were not always burned at the  level of tissues of which it becomes an integral part. Thinking that he had  easily refuted the Italian writers, Bernard added  In reality, physico-chemical manifestations do not change in nature, whether they take  place inside or outside the organism, in a healthy or diseased state. There is only one  kind of calorific agent; whether it is produced in a furnace or in an organism it is none  the less the same. There cannot be physical heat and animal heat, still less, morbid heat  and physiological heat. Morbid animal heat and physiological heat differ only in degree,  not in their nature (8, 394).  Hence the conclusion:  These ideas of a struggle between two opposing agents, of antagonism between life and  death, between health and sickness, inanimate and living nature have had their day. The  continuity of phenomena, their imperceptible gradation and harmony must be recogni­ zed everywhere (ibid.).  These last two texts seem to me to be particularly illuminating because </p><div id="pagenum"><p>52</p></div><p id="page">34 PART ONE  they reveal a chain of ideas found nowhere in the Lec;ons sur Ie diabete ['Lec­ tures on Diabetes']. The idea of the continuity between the normal and the  pathological is itself in continuity with the idea of the continuity between life  and death, organic and inorganic matter. Bernard has the indisputable merit  of having denied the antithesis admitted until then between the organic and  the mineral, plant and animal, of having affirmed the universal applicability  of the determinist postulate and the material identity of all physico-chemical  phenomena regardless of their setting and appearance. He was not the first to  assert the identity of the chemical products of the laboratory and those of  'living' chemistry -that idea was conceived after Wohler succeeded in syn­ thesizing urea in 1828 -he simply "reinforced the physiological impulse  given organic chemistry by the works of Dumas and Liebig" .12 But he was  the first to assert the physiological identity of plant functions and corre­ sponding animal functions. Until his time it was held that plant respiration was  the inverse of that of animals, that plants fixed carbon and animals burned it,  that plants performed reductions and animals, combustions, that plants  produced syntheses which animals destroyed by using them, as they were  incapable of producing anything similar.  Bernard denied all of these antitheses, and the discovery of the glycogenic  function of the liver is one of the most beautiful results of the desire to  "recognize everywhere the continuity of phenomena".  One probably does not have to ask now whether Bernard formed a correct  idea of what constitutes an antithesis or contrast, and whether it is justifiable  to consider the pair of notions, health-disease as symmetrical with the pair  life-death, to draw the conclusion that once he identified the terms of the  second, he was authorized to seek the identification of the terms of the first.  One will probably ask what Bernard meant by asserting the unity of life and  death. For the purposes of lay or religious polemic, it is often asked whether  Bernard was a materialist or a vitalist.13 It seems that a careful reading of the  Lec;ons sur les phenomenes de la vie ['Lectures on the Phenomena of Life']  (1878) suggests an answer full of nuances. From the physico-chemical point  of view, Bernard did not accept the distinction between the organic realm and  the mineral realm: "The chemistry of the laboratory and the chemistry of life  are subject to the same laws: there are not two chemistries" [10, I, 224] . This  amounts to saying that scientific analysis and experimental techniques can  identify and reproduce products of vital syntheses as well as inorganic objects.  But this simply asserts the homogeneity of matter within the living form and  outside of this form, for in refusing mechanistic materialism, Bernard asserts  the originality of the living form and its functional activities: </p><div id="pagenum"><p>53</p></div><p id="page">CLAUDE BERNARD AND EXPERIMENTAL PATHOLOGY 35  Although the vital manifestations are placed under the direct influence of physico­ chemical conditions, these conditions cannot organize, harmonize phenomena in the  order and succession which they assume particularly in living things [10, II, 218].  And still more precisely:  Along with Lavoisier I believe that living things are tributaries of the general laws of  nature and that their manifestations are physical and chemical expressions. Unlike phy­ sicists and chemists I am far from seeing vital actions in the phenomena of the inanimate  world -on the contrary I believe that the expression is particular, the mechanism spe­ cial, the agent specific although the result is the same. No chemical phenomenon exists  inside the body as it does outside of it [ibid.].  These last words could serve as an epigraph for the work of Jacques Duclaux  on the Analyse physico-chimique des fonctions vitales l'Physico-chemical  Analysis of Vital Functions'] . According to Duclaux, who, in this work was  obviously far from any kind of spiritualism, no intracellular chemical reaction  can be represented by an equation derived from experimentation in vitro:  As soon as a body can be represented by our symbols, living matter considers it an  enemy and eliminates or neutralizes it .... Man has created a chemistry which has  developed from natural chemistry without being confused with it [36].  Be that as it may, it seems clear that for Bernard, recognizing the continu­ ity of phenomena does not mean ignoring their originality. Given this, and  keeping the symmetry, could one not say what he says of the relations be­ tween inanimate and living matter? -there is only one physiology, but far  from seeing the type of pathological phenomena in physiological phenomena,  one must consider that its expression is particular, its mechanism special,  although the result is identical; no phenomenon exists in the diseased organ­ ism as it does in the healthy one. Why assert unreservedly the identity of  disease and health when one does not do so for life and death, when one  intends to use the relation between the latter as a model for that between  the former?  Claude Bernard, unlike Broussais and Comte, supported his geIl&ral principle  of pathology with verifiable arguments, protocols of experiments, and above  all methods for quantifying physiological concepts. Glycogenesis, glycemia,  glycosuria, combustion of food, heat from vasodilatation are not qualitative  concepts but the summaries of results obtained in terms of measurement.  From here on we know exactly whaf is meant when it is claimed that disease  is the exaggerated or diminished expression of a normal function. Or at least  we have the means to know it, for in spite of Bernard's undeniable progress in </p><div id="pagenum"><p>54</p></div><p id="page">36 PART ONE  logical precision, his thought is not entirely free from ambiguity.  First of all, with Bernard as with Bichat, Broussais, and Comte, there is  a deceptive mingling of quantitative and qualitative concepts in the given  definition of pathological phenomena. Sometimes the pathological state is  "the disturbance of a normal mechanism consisting in a quantitative variation,  an exaggeration or attenuation of normal phenomena" [9,360], sometimes  the diseased state is made up of "the exaggeration, disproportion, discordance  of normal phenomena" [8,391]. Who doesn't see that the term 'exaggeration'  has a distinctly quantitative sense in the first definition and a rather qualita­ tive one in the second. Did Bernard believe that he was eradicating the quali­ tative value of the term 'pathological' by substituting for it the terms dis­ turbance, dis-proportion, dis-cordance?  This ambiguity is certainly instructive in that it reveals that the problem  itself persists at the heart of the solution presumably given to it. And the  problem is the following: is the concept of disease a concept of an objective  reality accessible to quantitative scientific knowledge? Is the difference in  value, which the living being establishes between his normal life and his  pathological life, an illusory appearance which the scientist has the legitimate  obligation to deny? If this annulling of a qualitative contrast is theoretically  possible, it is clear that it is legitimate; if it is not possible, the question of its  legitimacy is superfluous.  It has been pointed out that Bernard uses two expressions interchangeably,  quantitative variations and differences of degree, that is, he makes two con­ cepts of them, homogeneity and continuity, the first used implicitly, the  second, expressly. The use of either of these concepts does not entail the  same logical requirements. If I assert the homogeneity of two objects, I must  at least define the nature of one of the two or rather some nature common  to both. But if I assert a continuity, I can only interpolate between the two  extremes all the intermediaries at my disposal, without reducing one to the  other, by divisions of progressively smaller intervals. This is so true that  certain writers claim continuity between health and disease in order to refuse  to define either ofthem.14 They say that there is no completely normal state,  no perfect health. This can mean that there exist only sick men. In an amus­ ing way Moliere and Jules Romains have shown what kind of 'iatrocracy' can  justify this assertion. But this could also mean that there are no sick men,  which is nonetheless absurd. One wonders whether physicians, in stating  seriously that perfect health does not exist and that consequently disease  cannot be defined, have suspected that they were purely and simply reviving  the problem of the existence of the perfect and the ontolOgical argument. </p><div id="pagenum"><p>55</p></div><p id="page">CLAUDE BERNARD AND EXPERIMENTAL PATHOLOGY 37  For a long time people tried to find out whether they could prove the  existence of the perfect being starting with its quality of perfection, since,  having all the perfections, it would also have that of bringing about its own  existence. The problem of the actual existence of perfect health is analogous.  As if perfect health were not a normative concept, an ideal type? Strictly  speaking a norm does not exist, it plays its role which is to devalue existence  by allowing its correction. To say that perfect health does not exist is simply  saying that the concept of health is not one of an existence, but of a norm  whose function and value is to be brought into contact with existence in  order to stimulate modification. This does not mean that health is an empty  concept.  But Claude Bernard is far from such a facile relativism, owing to the fact  that first, the assertion of continuity in his thought always implies that of  homogeneity, and second, he thinks that it is always possible to give an ex­ perimental content to the concept of the normal. For example what he calls  an animal's normal urine is the urine of an animal with an empty stomach,  always comparable to itself -the animal feeding itself in the same way with  its own reserves -and such that it serves as a constant frame of reference for  all the urine obtained in the feeding conditions which he wants to set up [5,  II, 13]. Later on we will discuss the relations between the normal and the  experimental. Right now, we only want to examine Bernard's point of view  when he conceives of the pathological phenomenon as a quantitative variation  of the normal phenomenon. Naturally it is understood that if in the course of  this examination we use recent physiological or clinical data, it is not to  reproach Bernard for having ignored what he could not know.  If glycosuria is considered to be the major symptom of diabetes, the presence  of sugar in diabetic urine makes it qualitatively different from normal urine.  In terms of the physiological state, the pathological state, when identified  with its principal symptom, is a new quality. But if in conSidering urine as a  product of renal secretion, the physician's thOUght turns to the kidney and  the relationship between the renal ftlter and the composition of the blood, he  will consider glycosuria as excess glycemia pouring over a threshold. The  glucose overflowing the threshold is qualitatively the same as the glucose  normally held back by the threshold. The only difference is, in effect, one of  quantity. If, then, the renal mechanism of urinary secretion is considered in  terms of its results -physiological effects or morbid symptoms -disease is  the appearance of a new quality; if the mechanism is considered in itself,  disease is only a quantitative variation. Likewise alkaptonuria could be cited </p><div id="pagenum"><p>56</p></div><p id="page">38 PART ONE  as an example of a normal chemical mechanism capable of producing an  abnormal symptom. Discovered by Boedeker in 1857, this rare disease con­ sists essentially in a disturbance of the metabolism of an amino acid, tyrosine.  Alkaptone or homogentisic acid is a normal product of the intermediate  metabolism of tyrosine, but alkaptonuric diseases are distinguished by their  incapacity to go beyond this phase and bum homogentisic acid [41,10.534].  Homogentisic acid then passes into the urine and is transformed in the pres­ ence of alkalis through oxidation to give off a black pigment coloring the  urine and giving it a new quality which is in no wayan exaggeration of some  qUality present in normal urine. Moreover, alkaptonuria can be brought about  experimentally by a massive absorption of tyrosine (50g every 24 hours).  Thus we have a pathological phenomenon which can be defined in terms  of quality or quantity depending on one's point of view, depending on  whether the vital phenomenon is considered in terms of its expression or its  mechanism.  But can one choose one's point of view? Is it not obvious that if we want  to work out a scientific pathology we must consider real causes and not appar­ ent effects, functional mechanisms and not their symptomatic expressions?  Is it not obvious that by relating glycosuria to glycemia and glycemia to  hepatic glycogenesis, Bernard was considering the mechanisms, the scientific  explanation of which derives from a number of quantitative relations; for  example, the physical laws of the equilibria of membrances, the law of the  concentration of solutions, the reactions of organic chemistry, etc.?  All of this would be indisputable if physiological functions could be con­ sidered as mechanisms, thresholds as barriers, regulations as safety valves,  servo-brakes or thermostats. Are we about to fall into all the traps and  dangers of the iatro-mechanist conceptions? To take the same example of  diabetes, today we are far from thinking that glycosuria is only a function of  glycemia and that the kidney simply prevents the filtration of glucose by  means of a constant threshold (of 1.70 pph and not 3 pph as Bernard first  thOUght). According to Chabanier and Lobo-Onell: "The renal threshold is  essentially mobile, and its behavior, variable, depending on the patients"  [25, 16]. On the one hand in subjects without hyperglycemia, glycosuria can  sometimes be demonstrated, even higher than that of true diabetics. This is  spoken of as renal glycosuria. On the other hand in subjects whose glycemia  sometimes reaches 3 g and more, glycosuria can be practically nil. This is  called pure hyperglycemia. Furthermore, two diabetics situated in the same  conditions for observation and showing the same glycemia of 2.50 g in the  morning on an empty stomach, can show a variable glycosuria, one losing </p><div id="pagenum"><p>57</p></div><p id="page">CLAUDE BERNARD AND EXPERIMENTAL PATHOLOGY 39  20 g and the other, 200 g of glucose in their urine [25,18].  We are now led to modify the classic scheme, which linked glycosuria to  basal disturbance by the sole intermediary of hyperglycemia, by introducing a  new articulation between hyperglycemia and glycosuria: 'renal behavior' [25,  19]. By speaking of the mobility of the threshold, of renal behavior, a notion  is introduced in the explanation of the mechanism of urinary secretion that  cannot be entirely translated into analytical and quantitative terms. This  amounts to saying that to become a diabetic is to change kidneys, a proposi­ tion which will seem absurd only to those who identify a function with its  anatomical position. It seems permissible to conclude that by substituting  mechanisms for symptoms in the comparison between the physiological and  the pathological state, no difference in quality between the two states is  eliminated at all.  This conclusion looms larger still when we stop dividing disease into a  multiplicity of functional mechanisms gone wrong, and regard it as an event  involving the living organism taken as a whole. This is very much the case of  diabetes. Today we say it is a "diminution of the ability to use glucose in  terms of glycemia" [25,12]. Von Mering and Minkowski's discovery in 1889  of experimental pancreatic diabetes, Laguesse's discovery of the endocrine  pancreas, Banting and Best's isolation in 1920 of the insulin secreted by the  islands of Langerhans, made possible the assertion that the fundamental dis­ turbance in diabetes is hypoinsulinemia [diabetes mellitus]. Must it be said  then that these researches, unsuspected by Bernard, finally confirmed his  principles of general pathology? Certainly not, for in 1930-31 Houssay and  Biasotti showed, by destroying both the pancreas and the pituitary in the  toad and dog, that the role of the pituitary and the pancreas were antagonis­ tic in metabolism. Following total removal of the pancreas a healthy dog  cannot survive for more than four or five weeks. But a combination of a  hypophysectomy [removal of the pituitary] and a pancreatectomy produces  considerable improvement in diabetes: glycosuria is very much reduced and,  on an empty stomach, even suppressed; polyuria is suppressed, glycemia is  near normal, and weight loss is very much slowed down. Hence it seemed  warranted to conclude that the action of insulin in the metabolism of glucides  is not direct since diabetes can be lessened without the administration of  insulin. In 1937 Young established that with an injection of an extract of  the anterior lobe of the pituitary every day for about three weeks, a normal  dog could sometimes be made definitely diabetic. Louis Hedon and Auguste  Loubatieres, who took up Young's study of experimental diabetes in France,  concluded: "Temporary hyperactivity of the anterior lobe of the pituitary </p><div id="pagenum"><p>58</p></div><p id="page">40 PART ONE  can be at the source of not only a transitory disturbance of glycoregulation  but also permanent diabetes which persists indefinitely after the disappear­ ance of the cause which set it off' [54, 105J. Have we been sent from dimi­ nution to augmentation, and is Bernard's insight flawless just when we be­ lieved it at fault? It does not seem so because, all things considered, this  pituitary hypersecretion is only a symptom, at the glandular level, of either  a pituitary tumor or a general endocrinal readjustment (puberty, menopause,  pregnancy). As far as internal secretions are concerned, as in the case of the  nervous system, localizations are 'privileged' rather than absolute and what  appears to be partial augmentation or diminution is in fact an alteration in  the whole. "Nothing is more illusory", writes Rathery,  than to consider the metabolism of glucides as under the sole control of the pancreas  and its secretion. The metabolism of glucides depends on many factors: (a) blood vascu­ lar glands; (b) the liver; (c) the nervous system; (d) vitamins; (e) mineral elements, etc.  Now, anyone of these factors can come into play to bring about diabetes [98,22].  If we consider diabetes as a nutritional disease and constant glycemia as  a tonus indispensable to the existence of the organism taken as a whole  (Soula), IS we are far from being able to draw the conclusions about general  pathology from the study of diabetes that Claude Bernard drew from it in  1877.  These conclusions are to be criticized not so much for being wrong as for  being inadequate and incomplete. They stem from the unwarranted extra·  polation of a perhaps privileged case and moreover from a definition which is  clumsy in terms of the point of view adopted. It is correct that certain symp­ toms are the quantitatively varied product of constant mechanisms of the  physiological state. This would be the case, for example, with hyperchlor­ hydria in the ulcerous stomach. It is possible for some mechanisms to be the  same in the state of health and in the state of disease. In the case of a stomach  ulcer, the reflex which determines the secretion of gastric juices always seems  to originate from the pyloric cavity, if it is true that they are stenosal ulcers  near the pylorus accompanied by the most significant hypersecretion and if  the removal of this region through a gastrectomy is followed by a reduction  of the secretion.  But first of all, as far as the precise case of ulcers is concerned, it must be  said that the essence of the disease consists not in hyperchlorhydria, but rath­ er in the fact that here the stomach is digesting itself, a state which everyone  will undoubtedly agree differs profoundly from the normal. Incidentally, per­ haps this would be a good example to explain what a normal function is. A </p><div id="pagenum"><p>59</p></div><p id="page">CLAUDE BERNARD AND EXPERIMENTAL PATHOLOGY 41  function could be said to be nonnal as long as it is independent of the effect  it produces. The stomach is nonnal as long as it digests without digesting  itself. What is true of balance scales is also true of functions: fidelity first,  then sensitivity.  Furthennore it must be said that the reduction of all pathological cases  to the explanatory scheme proposed by Bernard is very remote. This is parti­ cularly true of the scheme put forward in the Le<;ons sur la chaleur animale  ['Lectures on Animal Heat']. Of course there is no normal heat and patho­ logical heat, in the sense that both can be expressed in terms of identical  physical effects, the dilatation of a column of mercury in the course of taking  a rectal or axillary temperature. But the identity of the heat does not involve  the identity of the source of heat nor even the identity of the mechanism for  liberating the calories. Claude Bernard answered his Italian adversaries by say­ ing that animal heat always derives from food burned at the tissue level. But  the same food can be burned in any number of ways, its breakdown stopping  at different stages. To postulate, with reason, the identity of chemical and  physical laws with one another, does not oblige one to ignore the specificity  of the phenomena which reveal them. When in the course of measurement of  basal metabolism, a woman suffering from Basedow's [or Graves'] disease  breathes into a closed space whose variation in volume will give the rate of  oxygen consumption, oxygen is always burned according to the chemical laws  of oxidation (S calories for one liter of O2), and it is precisely by setting up  the constancy of these laws in this case that one can calculate the variation in  metabolism and term it abnonnal. It is in this precise sense that there is an  identity of the physiological and the pathological. But it could also be said  that there is an identity of the chemical and the pathological. It will be agreed  that this is one way to make the pathological disappear and not to clarify it.  Isn't this also true of the case where it is declared homogenous with the phy­ siological?  By way of summary, Claude Bernard's theory is valid in certain limited  cases:  (1) as long as the pathological phenomenon is limited to some symptom,  leaving aside its clinical context (hyperchlorhydria, hyperthennia or hypo­ thermia; reflex hyperexcitability);  (2) as long as symptomatic effects are traced back to partial functional  mechanisms (glycosuria in terms of hyperglycemia; alkaptonuria in terms of  the incomplete metabolism of tyrosine).  Even when limited to these precise cases, his theory runs into many diffi­ culties. Who would maintain that hypertension is a simple increase in the </p><div id="pagenum"><p>60</p></div><p id="page">42 PART ONE  physiological arterial pressure and neglect the profound alteration in the  structure and function of the vital organs (heart and blood vessels, kidneys,  lungs), an alteration such that it constitutes a new way of life for the organ­ ism, new behavior which prudent therapy must take into account by not  treating the tension at an unpropitious moment in order to bring it back to  the norm? Who would maintain that hypersensitivity to certain toxic sub­ stances is a simple quantitative modification of a normal reactivity, without  first asking himself whether there isn't only the appearance (of the fact of  poor renal elimination or of an overly rapid reabsorption in relation to a  general defined state), without subsequently distinguishing isotoxic intoler­ ance where phenomena are changed only quantitatively, and heterotoxic  intolerance, where new symptoms appear in relation to a change of the cellu­ lar reactivity to the poison (A. Schwartz)?16 The same is true of functional  mechanisms, which can be easily experimented with separately. But in the  living organism all functions are interdependent and their rhythms are coordi­ nated: renal behavior can be only theoretically divorced from the behavior of  the organism functioning as a whole.  By taking examples of the order of metabolic phenomena (diabetes, animal  heat), Bernard found cases which were too unilateral to be generalized with­ out some arbitrariness. How can infectious diseases, whose etiology and  pathogenesis were then beginning to emerge from their prescientific borders,  be explained within the framework of his ideas? Certainly the theory of  inconspicuous infections [inapparent] (Charles Nicolle)17 and the theory  of te"ain allow the assertion that infectious disease pushed roots into the  so-called normal state. But this widespread opinion is not unassailable for all  that. It is not normal for a healthy subject to have diphtheria bacilli lodged in  his throat, in the same sense that it is normal for him to eliminate phosphates  in his urine or contract his pupils when passing qUickly from the dark into the  light. A disease in a state of suspension or remission is not a normal state  analogous to the exercising of a function, whose blockage would be fatal.  Similarly, if it is a good idea to bear in mind the te"ain as Pasteur himself  advised, one should perhaps still not go to the length of making a microbe an  epiphenomenon. It takes one last fragment of crystal to obtain the solidifi­ cation of a supersaturated solution. Strictly speaking, it takes a microbe to  make an infection. Without doubt it has been possible to produce lesions like  those of pneumonia or typhoid by means of physical or chemical irritation of  the splanchnic nerve [80]. But in order to keep to the classical explanation of  infection, one can try, once infection has occurred, to reestablish a certain  continuity between before and after by using etiological antecedents. It seems </p><div id="pagenum"><p>61</p></div><p id="page">CLAUDE BERNARD AND EXPERIMENTAL PATHOLOGY 43  difficult to assert that the infectious state produces no real discontinuity in  the history of the living being.  Nervous diseases constitute another awkward fact for Bernard's explana­ tion based on his principles. These have long been described in terms of exag­ geration and deficiency. When the higher functions of life as it relates to the  external world were considered as the sums of elementary reflexes, and the  brain centers as pigeon-holes for images or impressions, a quantitative ex­ planation of pathological phenomena was inevitable. But the conceptions of  Hughlings Jackson, Head, and Sherrington, paving the way for more recent  theories such· as those of Goldstein, oriented research in directions where  facts took on a synthetic qualitative value, at first ignored. We will come back  to this later. It will be enough to say here briefly that according to Goldstein,  normal behavior in relation to language disturbances, can be explained in  pathological terms only on the condition that the notion of the modification  of personality by disease is introduced. In general, anyone act of a normal  subject must not be related to an analogous act of a sick person without  understanding the sense and value of the pathological act for the possibilities  of existence of the modified organism:  One must refrain from thinking that the different attitudes possible in a sick person  merely represent a kind of residue of normal behavior, what survived destruction. The  attitudes which have survived in the sick person never turn up in that form in a normal  subject, not even in the inferior stages of its ontogenesis or phylogenesis, as it is all too  frequently admitted. Disease has given them particular forms and they cannot be under­ stood well unless the morbid state is taken into account [45,437).  In short, the continuity of the normal state and the pathological state does  not seem real in the case of infectious diseases, no more than homogeneity in  the case of nervous diseases.  By way of summary, in the medical domain, Claude Bernard, with the author­ ity of every innovator who proves movement by marching, formulated the  profound need of an era which believed in the omnipotence of a technology  founded on science, and which felt comfortable in life in spite, or perhaps  because of, romantic lamentations. An art of living -as medicine is in the full  sense of the word -implies a science of life. Efficient therapeutics assumes  experimental pathology, which in turn cannot be separated from physiology.  "Physiology and pathology are intermingled and are one and the same thing."  But must it be deduced from this, with brutal simplicity, that life is the same  in health and disease, that it learns nothing in disease and through it? The  science of opposites is one, said Aristotle. Must it be concluded from this that </p><div id="pagenum"><p>62</p></div><p id="page">44 PART ONE  opposites are not opposites? That the science of life should take so-called  normal and so-called pathological phenomena as objects of the same theoreti­ cal importance, susceptible of reciprocal clarification in order to make itself  fit to meet the totality of the vicissitudes of life in all its aspects, is urgent far  more than it is legitimate. This does not mean that pathology is nothing other  than physiology, and still less that disease, as it relates to the normal state,  represents only an increase or a reduction. It is understood that medicine  needs an objective pathology, but research which causes its object to vanish  is not objective. One can deny that disease is a kind of violation of the organ­ ism and consider it as an event which the organism creates through some trick  of its permanent functions, without denying that the trick is new. An organ­ ism's behavior can be in continuity with previous behaviors and still be  another behavior. The progressiveness of an advent does not exclude the  originality of an event. The fact that a pathological symptom, considered by  itself, expresses the hyperactivity of a function whose product is exactly  identical with the product of the same function in so-called normal condi­ tions, does not mean that an organic disturbance, conceived as another aspect  of the whole of functional totality and. not as a summary of symptoms, is not  a new mode of behavior for the organism relative to its environment.  In the final analysis, would it not be appropriate to say that the pathologi­ cal can be distinguished as such, that is, as an alteration of the normal state,  only at the level of organic iotality, and when it concerns man, at the level of  conscious individual totality, where disease becomes a kind of evil? To be sick  means th~t a man really lives another life, even in the biological sense of the  word. To return once more to diabetes, it is not a kidney disease because of  glycosuria, nor a pancreatic disease because of hypoinsulinemia, nor a disease  of the pituitary; it is the disease of an organism all of whose functions are  changed, which is threatened by tuberculosis, whose supperated infections are  endless, whose limbs are rendered useless by arteritis and gangrene; moreover,  it can strike man or woman, threaten them with coma, often hit them with  impotence or sterility, for whom pregnancy, should it occur, is a catastrophe,  whose tears -oh irony of secretions! -are sweet!8 It seems very artifical  to break up disease into symptoms or to consider its complications in the  abstract. What is a symptom without context or background? What is a com­ plication separated from what it complicates? When an isolated symptom or a  functional mechanism is termed pathological, one forgets that what makes  them so is their inner relation in the indivisible totality of individual behavior.  The situation is such that if the physiological analysis of separated functions  is known in the presence of pathological facts, this is due to previous clinical </p><div id="pagenum"><p>63</p></div><p id="page">CLAUDE BERNARD AND EXPERIMENTAL PATHOLOGY 45  information, for clinical practice puts the physician in contact with complete  and concrete individuals and not with organs and their functions. Pathology,  whether anatomical or physiological, analyzes in order to know more, but it  can be known as pathology, that is, as the study of the mechanisms of disease,  only insofar as it receives from clinical practice this notion of disease, whose  origin must be sought in the experience men have in their relations with the  whole of their environment.  If the above propositions make some sense, how can we then explain that  the modern clinician more readily adopts the point of view of the physiologist  than that of the sick man? It is undoubtedly because of this massive fact of  medical experience, namely that subjective morbid symptoms and objective  symptoms rarely overlap. It is simply capricious for a urologist to say that a  man who complains of his kidneys is a man who has nothing wrong with his  kidneys. For the sick man the kidneys are a cutaneous-muscular territory in  the lumbar region, while for the physician they are vital organs connected to  others. The well-known fact about reported pains, whose multiple explana­ tions have been very obscure up to now, prevents one from thinking that the  pains experienced by the sick man as major subjective symptoms bear a con­ stant relation to the underlying organs to which they seem to call attention.  But most of all, the often prolonged latency of certain degeneracies, the  inconspicuousness of certain infestations or infections lead the physician to  regard the direct pathological experience of the patient as negligible, even to  consider it as systematically falSifying the objective pathological fact. Every  physician knows, having learned it occasionally to his embarrassment, that  the immediate sensible awareness of organic life in itself constitutes neither a  science of the same organism nor infallible knowledge of the localization or  date of the pathological lesions involving the human body.  Here is perhaps why until now pathology has retained so little of that  character which disease has for the sick man -of being really another way of  life. Certainly pathology is correct in suspecting and rectifying the opinion of  the sick man who, because he feels different, thinks he also knows in what  and how he is different. It does not follow that because the sick man is clearly  mistaken on this second point, he is also mistaken on the first. Perhaps his  feeling is the foreshadowing of what contemporary pathology is just begin­ ning to see, namely that the pathological state is not a simple, quantitatively  varied extension of the physiological state, but something else entirely .19 * </p><div id="pagenum"><p>64</p></div><p id="page">IV  THE CONCEPTIONS OF RENE LERICHE  The invalidity of the sick man's judgment concerning the reality of his own  illness is an important theme in a recent theory of disease. This is Leriche's  theory, which, though at times rather wavering, is nuanced, concrete, and  profound. It seems necessary to present and examine it after the preceding  theory, which it extends in one direction and from which it clearly deviates  in others. "Health", says Leriche, "is life lived in the silence of the organs"  [73, 6.16-1] . Conversely, "disease is what irritates men in the normal course  of their lives and work, and above all, what makes them suffer" [73,6.22-3].  The state of health is a state of unawareness where the subject and his body  are one. Conversely, the awareness of the body consists in a feeling of limits,  threats, obstacles to health. Taking these formulae in their full sense, they  mean that the actual notion of the normal depends on the possibility of vio­ lating the norm. Here at last are definitions which are not empty words,  where the relativity of the contrasting terms is correct. For all that the primi­ tive term is not positive; for all that the negative term does not represent  nothingness. Health is positive, but not primitive, disease is negative, but in  the form of opposition (irritation), not deprivation.  Nevertheless, if neither reservation nor correction is subsequently brought  to bear on the definition of health, the definition of disease is immediately  straightened out. For this definition of disease is that of the sick man, not that  of the doctor; and valuable though it is from the point of view of awareness,  it is not the point of view of science. Leriche shows, in effect, that the silence  of the organs does not necessarily equal the absence of disease, that there are  functional lesions or perturbations which long remain imperceptible to those  whose lives they endanger. It is with the frequent delay in feeling our internal  irregularities that we pay for the prodigality with which our organism has  been constructed, for it has too many of every tissue: more lungs than are  strictly required for breathing, more kidneys than are needed to secrete urine  to the edge of intoxication. The conclusion is that "if one wants to define  disease, it must be dehumanized" [73,6.22-3]; and more brutally, "in dis­ ease, when all is said and done, the least important thing is man" [73,6.22- 4]. Hence it is no longer pain or functional incapacity and social infirmity  which makes disease, but rather anatomical alteration or physiological disturb- 46 </p><div id="pagenum"><p>65</p></div><p id="page">THE CONCEPTIONS OF RENE LERICHE 47  ance. Disease plays its tricks at the tissue level, and in this sense, there can be  sickness without a sick person. Take, for example, a man who has never com­ plained of pathological occurrences and whose life is cut short by murder or a  car crash. According to Leriche's theory, if an autopsy of medical-legal intent  were to reveal a cancer of the kidney unknown to its late owner, one should  conclude in favor of a disease, although there would be no one to whom to  attribute it -neither to the cadaver which is no longer competent, nor retro­ actively to the formerly live man who had no idea of it, having had his life  come to an end before the cancer's stage of development at which, in all clini­ cal probability, pain would have fmally announced the illness. The disease  which never existed in the man's consciousness begins to exist in the physi­ cian's science. We think that there is nothing in science that has not first  appeared in the consciousness, and that in the case now before us, it is parti­ cularly the sick man's point of view which forms the basis of truth. And here  is why. Doctors and surgeons have clinical information and sometimes use  laboratory techniques which allow them to see 'patients' in people who do  not feel that way. This is a fact. But a fact to be interpreted. It is only because  today's practitioners are the heirs to a medical culture transmitted to them by  yesterday's practitioners that, in terms of clinical perspicacity, they overtake  and outstrip their regular or occasional clients. There has always been a mo­ ment when, all things considered, the practitioner's attention has been drawn  to certain symptoms, even solely objective ones, by men who were complain­ ing of not being normal -that is, of not being the same as they had been in  the past -or of suffering. If, today, the physician's knowledge of disease can  anticipate the sick man's experience of it, it is because at one time this experi­ ence gave rise to, summoned up, that knowledge. Hence medicine always  exists de jure, if not de facto, because there are men who feel sick, not be­ cause there are doctors to tell men of their illnesses. The historical evolution  of the relations between the physician and the sick man in clinical consulta­ tion changes nothing in the normal, permanent relationship of the sick man  and disease.  This critique can be all the more boldly propounded in that Leriche, re­ tracting what was too trenchant in his first formulation, partially confirms  it. Carefully distinguishing the static from the dynamic point of view in  pathology, Leriche claims complete primacy for the latter. To those who  would identify disease and leSion, Leriche objected that the anatomical fact  must in reality be considered "second and secondary: second, because it is  produced by a primitively functional deviation in the life of the tissues;  secondary, because it is only one element in the disease and not the dominant </p><div id="pagenum"><p>66</p></div><p id="page">48 PART ONE  one" [73, 6.76-6]. Consequently it is the sick man's disease which very  unexpectedly becomes again the adequate concept of disease, more adequate  in any case than the concept of the anatomical pathologist.  The idea must be accepted that the disease of the sick man is not the anatomical disease  of the doctor. A stone in an atrophic gall bladder can fail to give symptoms for years and  consequently create no disease, although there is a state of pathological anatomy ....  Under the same anatomical appearances one is sick and one isn't .... The difficulty  must no longer be conjured away by simply saying that there are silent and masked  forms of disease: these are nothing but mere words. The lesion is not enough perhaps  to make the clinical disease the disease of the sick man, for this disease is something  other than the disease of the anatomical pathologist [73,6.76-6].  But it is not a good idea to credit Leriche with more than he has decided to  accept. What he in fact means by the sick person is much more the organism  in action, in functions, than the individual aware of his organic functions.  The sick man in this new definition is not wholly the sick man of the first,  the actual man aware of his favored or disfavored situation in life. The sick  man has ceased to be an entity for the anatomist but he remains an entity for  the physiologist, for Leriche states precisely: "This new representation of  disease leads medicine into closer contact with physiology, that is, with the  science of functions, and leads it to concern itself at least as much with  pathological physiology as with pathological anatomy" [73, 6.76-6] . Thus  the coincidence of disease and the sick man takes place in the physiologist's  science, but not yet in the real man's consciousness. And yet this first coin­ cidence is enough, for Leriche himself provides us with the means to obtain  from this the second.  Taking up Claude Bernard's ideas -certainly in full awareness -Leriche  also asserts the continuity and indiscernability of the physiological state and  the pathological state. For example, in forming the theory of vasoconstrictive  phenomena (whose long unrecognized complexity he demonstrated) and their  transformation into spasm phenomena, Leriche writes:  From tonus to vaso-constriction, that is, to physiological hypertonia, from vaso·constric­ tion to spasm, there is no borderline. One passes from one state to the other without  transition, and it is the effects rather than the thing itself which makes for differentia­ tions. Between physiology and pathology there is no threshold [74,234].  Let us understand this last formulation clearly. There is no quantitative  threshold which can be detected by objective methods of measurement. But  there is nonetheless qualitative distinction and opposition in terms of the  different effects of the same quantitatively variable cause. </p><div id="pagenum"><p>67</p></div><p id="page">THE CONCEPTIONS OF RENE LERICHE 49  Even with perfect conservation of the arterial structure, the spasm, at a distance, has  grave pathological effects: it causes pain, produces fragmented or diffuse necroses; last  and not least it gives rise to capillary and arterial obliteration at the periphery of the  system [74,234).  Obliteration, necrosis, pain -these are pathological facts for which physio­ logical equivalents are sought in vain: a blocked artery is, physiologically  speaking, no longer an artery, since it is an obstacle, and no longer a path for  circulation; physiologically, a necrotic cell is no longer a cell, since, if there is  an anatomy of the cadaver, in terms of an etymological definition, there  could not exist a physiology of the cadaver; fmally, pain is not a physiological  sensation because, according to Leriche, "pain is not in nature's pain".  As far as the problem of pain is concerned, Leriche's original and profound  thesis is known. It is impossible to consider pain as the expression of a normal  activity, of a sense susceptible of permanent exercise, a sense which would  exert itself through the organ of specialized, peripheral receptors, of suitable  paths of nervous conduction and delimited central analysers; equally impos­ sible to consider pain either as a detector of and diligent warning signal for  events menacing organic integrity from within and without, or as a reaction  of salutary defense which the doctor should respect and even reinforce. Pain  is "a monstrous individual phenomenon and not a law of the species. A fact  of disease" [74, 490] . We must understand the full importance of these last  words. Disease is no longer defined in terms of pain; rather, pain is presented  as disease. And what Leriche understands this time as disease is not the quan­ titative modification of a phYSiological or normal phenomenon but rather an  authentically abnormal state. "Pain-disease in us is like an accident which  runs counter to the laws of normal sensation .... Everything about it is ab­ normal, rebels against the law" [74,490]. At this point Leriche is so sensible  of his departure from a classical dogma that he feels the very familiar need to  call upon its majesty at the very moment that he is forced to undermine its  foundations. "Yes, of course, pathology is never anything but a physiology  gone wrong. It was at the College de France, in this chair that this idea was  born and every day it strikes us as being increasingly true" [74,482]. The phe­ nomenon of pain thus verifies electively Leriche's ever-present theory of the  state of disease as a "physiological novelty". This conception comes to light in  a timid way in thelast pages of Vol. VI of the Encyclopedie /rancaise (1936):  Disease no longer appears to us as a parasite living on and of the man it consumes. We see  here the consequence of a deviation -small at fITSt -of the physiological order. In  short, it is a new physiological order to which therapeutics must aim to adapt the sick  man [73,6.76-6). </p><div id="pagenum"><p>68</p></div><p id="page">50 PART ONE  But this conception is plainly asserted by the following:  The production of a symptom, even a major one, in a dog, does not mean that we have  brought about a human disease. The latter is always an aggregate. That which produces  disease in us touches life's ordinary resiliences so subtly that their responses are less that  of a physiology gone wrong than that of a new physiology where many things, tuned in  a new key, have unusualresonance [76, 11).  It is not possible for us to examine this theory of pain for its own sake  with all the attention it deserves, but we must still indicate its interest for the  problem concerning us here. It seems quite important to us that a doctor  recognize in pain a phenomenon of total reaction which makes sense, which is  a sensation only at the level of concrete human individuality. "Physical pain  is not a simple question of nerve impulses moving at a fixed speed along a  nerve. It is the result of the conflict between a stimulant and the individual as  a whole" [74, 488] . It seems to us quite important that a doctor state that  man makes his pain -as he makes a disease or as he makes his mourning - rather than that he receives it or submits to it. Conversely, to consider pain as  an impression received at a point of the body and transmitted to the brain is  to assume tha~ it is complete of and in itself, without any relation to the  activity of the subject who experiences it. It is possible that the inadequacy  of anatomical and physiological data in this problem gives Leriche complete  freedom, starting from other positive arguments, to deny the specificity of  pain. But to deny the anatomic and physiological specificity of a nerve ap­ paratus peculiar to pain is not, in our opinion, necessarily to deny the func­ tional character of pain. Certainly, it is too obvious that pain is not always a  faithful and infallible warning signal, that the finalists are kidding themselves  by assigning it premonitory capacities and responsibilities which no science  of the human body would want to assume. But it is equally obvious that  indifference on the part of a living being to his conditions of life, to the  quality of his exchanges with his environment is profoundly abnormal. It can  be admitted that pain is a vital sensation without admitting that it has a parti­ cular organ or that it has encyclopedic value as a mine of information with  regard to the topographical or functional order. The physiologist can indeed  denounce the illusions of pain as the physicist does those of sight; this means  that sensation is not knowledge and that its normal value is not a theoretical  value, but this does not mean that it is normally without value. It seems that  one must above all carefully distinguish pain of integumentary [surface]  origin from pain of visceral origin. If the latter is presented as abnormal, it  seems difficult to dispute the normal character of pain which arises at the </p><div id="pagenum"><p>69</p></div><p id="page">THE CONCEPTIONS OF RENE LERICHE 51  surface of the organism's separation from, as well as encounter with the  environment. The suppression of integumentary pain in scleroderma or  syringomyelia can lead to the organism's indifference to attacks on its integ­ rity.  But what we must bear in mind is that Leriche, in defining disease, sees no  other way to define it except in terms of its effects. Now with at least one of  these effects, pain, we unequivocally leave the plane of abstract science for  the sphere of concrete awareness. This time we obtain the total coincidence of  disease and th~ diseased person, for pain-disease, to speak as Leriche does, is a  fact at the level of the entire conscious individual, it is a fact which Leriche's  fine analyses, relating the partiCipation and collaboration of the whole indivi­ dual to his pain, allow us to call 'behavior'.  From here on in we can see clearly in what ways Leriche's ideas extend those  of Comte and Bernard and, being subtler and richer in authentic medical ex­ perience, in what ways they deviate from them, for with regard to the rela­ tions between physiology and pathology Leriche brings to bear the judgment  of the technician, not that of the philosopher like Comte or the scientist like  Bernard. The idea which Comte and Bernard have in common -despite the  difference in intentions mentioned above -is that normally a technology  must be the application of a science. This is the fundamental positivist idea:  to know in order to act. Physiology must throw light on pathology in order  to establish therapeutics. Comte thought that disease served as a substitute  for experiments, and Claude Bernard, that experiments, even those performed  on animals, led us to the diseases of man. But, in the final analysis, for both  men we can progress logically only from experimental physiological knowl­ edge to medical technology. Leriche himself thinks that we progress more  often in fact -and should always in theory -from medical and surgical  technology prompted by the pathological state to physiological knowledge.  Knowledge of the physiological state is obtained by retrospective abstraction  from the clinical and therapeutic experience.  We can ask ourselves whether the study of normal man, even when it is based on that of  animals, will ever be enough to inform us fully about the normal life of man. The genero­ sity of the plan on which we are built makes analysis very difficult. Above all, this analy­ sis is carried out by studying the deficiencies produced by the suppression of organs, that  is, by introducing variables in the order of li~e and looking for the consequences. Unfor­ tunately, with a healthy person experimentation is always a bit brutal in its determinism  and the healthy man quickly corrects the slightest spontaneous insufficiency. It is per­ haps easier when variables are introduced into man imperceptibly by means of disease, or </p><div id="pagenum"><p>70</p></div><p id="page">52 PART ONE  therapeutically, once disease has struck. The sick man can thus advance knowledge about  the normal man. By studying him, deficiencies are discovered in him that the most subtle  experiment would fail to produce in animals, and thanks to which normal life can be  regained. In this way the complete study of disease tends to become an increasingly  essential element of normal physiology [73,6.76-6].  Obviously, these ideas are closer to those of Comte than to those of Claude  Bernard -but with a big difference. As we have seen, Comte thinks that  knowledge of the normal state must normally precede an evaluation of the  pathological state and that, strictly speaking, it could be formed -though  without the ability to extend very far -without the slightest reference to  pathology; similarly Comte defends the independence of theoretical biology  in relation to medicine and therapeutics [27, 247]. By contrast Leriche  thinks that physiology is the collection of solutions to problems posed by  sick men through their illnesses. This is indeed one of the most profound  insights on the problem of the pathological: "At every moment there lie with­ in us many more physiological possibilities than physiology would tell us  about. But it takes disease to reveal them to us" [76, 11] . Physiology is the  science of the functions and ways of life, but it is life which suggests to the  physiologist the ways to explore, for which he codifies the laws. Physiology  cannot impose on life just those ways whose mechanism is intelligible to it.  Diseases are new ways of life. Without the diseases which incessantly renew  the area to be explored, physiology would mark time on well-trod ground.  But the foregoing idea can also be understood in another, slightly different  sense. Disease reveals normal functions to us at the precise moment when it  deprivd us of their exercise. Disease is the source of the speculative attention  which life attaches to life by means of man. If health is life in the silence of  the organs, then, strictly speaking, there is no science of health. Health is  organic innocence. It must be lost, like all innocence, so that knowledge may  be possible. Physiology is like all science, which, as Aristotle says, proceeds  from wonder. But the truly vital wonder is the anguish caused by disease.  It was no exaggeration to announce in the introduction to this chapter  that Leriche's conceptions, placed once again in historical perspective, would  be able to take on unexpected emphasis. It does not seem possible that any  philosophical or medical exploration of the theoretical problems posed by  disease can ignore them in the future. At the risk of offending certain minds  for whom the intellect is realized only in intellectualism, let me repeat once  more that the intrinsic value of Leriche's theory -independent of any c'ritic­ ism applicable to some details of content -lies in the fact that it is the theory  of a technology, a theory for which technology exists, not as a docile servant </p><div id="pagenum"><p>71</p></div><p id="page">THE CONCEPTIONS OF RENE LERICHE 53  carrying out intangible orders, but as advisor and animator, directing atten­ tion to concrete problems and orienting research in the direction of obstacles  without presuming anything in advance of the theoretical solutions which will  arise. </p><div id="pagenum"><p>72</p></div><p id="page">v  IMPLICATIONS OF THE THEORY  "Medicine", says Sigerist, "is the most closely linked to the whole of culture,  every transformation in medical conceptions being conditioned by trans­ formations in the ideas of the epoch" [107, 42]. The theory we just ex­ pounded, at once medical, scientific, and philosophical, perfectly verifies this  proposition. It seems to us to satisfy simultaneously several demands and  intellectual postulates of the historical moment of the culture in which it was  formulated.  First of all there emerges from this theory the conviction of rationalist  optimism that evil has no reality. What distinguishes nineteenth century medi­ cine (particularly before the era of Pasteur) in relation to the medicine of  earlier centuries is its resolutely monist character. Eighteenth century medi­ cine, despite the efforts of the iatromechanists and iatrochemists, and under  the influence of the animists and vitalists, remained a dualist medicine, a  medical Manicheism. Health and Disease fought over man the way Good and  Evil fought over the World. It is with a great deal of intellectual satisfaction  that we take up the following passage in a history of medicine:  Paracelsus was a visionary, Van Helmont, a mystic, Stahl, a pietist. All three were innova­ tive geniuses but were influenced by their environment and by inherited traditions. What  makes appreciation of the reform doctrines of these three great men very hard is the  extreme difficulty one experiences in trying to separate their scientific from their reli­ gious beliefs .... It is not at all certain that Paracelsus did not believe that he had found  the elixir of life; it is certain that Van Helmont identified health with salvation and sick­ ness with sin; and in his account of Theoria medica vera Stahl himself, despite hls intel­ lectual vigor, availed himself more than he needed to of the belief in original sin and the  fall of man [48,311).  More than he needed to! says the author, quite the great admirer of Broussais,  sworn enemy at the dawn of the nineteenth century of all medical ontology.  The denial of an ontological conception of disease, a negative corollary of the  assertion of a quantitative identity between the normal and the pathological,  is first, perhaps, the deeper refusal to confirm evil. It certainly cannot be  denied that a scientific therapeutics is superior to a magical or mystical one.  It is certain that knowledge is better than ignorance when action is required,  and in this sense the value of the philosophy of the Enlightenment and of  54 </p><div id="pagenum"><p>73</p></div><p id="page">IMPLICATIONS OF THE THEORY 55  positivism, even scientistic, is indisputable. It would not be a question of  exempting doctors from the study of physiology and pharmacology. It is very  important not to identify disease with either sin or the devil. But it does not  follow from the fact that evil is not a being, that it is a concept devoid of  meaning; it does not follow that there are no negative values, even among  vital values; it does not follow that the pathological state is essentially nothing  other than the normal state.  Conversely, the theory in question conveys the humanist conviction that  man's action on his environment and on himself can and must become com­ pletely one with his knowledge of the environment and man; it must be  normally only the application of a previously instituted science. Looking at  the Leqons sur Ie diabete ['Lectures on Diabetes'] it is obvious that if one  asserts the real homogeneity and continuity of the normal and the pathologi­ cal it is in order to establish a physiological science that would govern thera­ peutic activity by means of the intermediary of pathology. Here the fact that  human consciousness experiences occasions of new growth and theoretical  progress in its domain of non-theoretical, pragmatic, and technical activity is  not appreciated. To deny technology a value all its own outside of the knowl­ edge it succeeds in incorporating, is to render unintelligible the irregular way  of the progress of knowledge and to miss that overtaking of science by power  which the positivists have so often stated while they deplored it. If techno­ logy's rashness, unmindful of the obstacles to be encountered, did not con­ stantly anticipate the prudence of codified knowledge, the number of scienti­ fic problems to resolve, which are surprises after having been setbacks, would  be far fewer. Here is the truth that remains in empiricism, the philosophy of  intellectual adventure, which an experimental method, rather too tempted,  by reaction, to rationalize itself, failed to recognize.  Nevertheless, Claude Bernard cannot be reproached -without our being  inaccurate -for having ignored the intellectual stimulus found by physiology  in clinical practice. He himself acknowledged the fact that his experiments on  glycemia and glucose production in the animal organism have as their point of  departure observations related to diabetes and the disproportion sometimes  noticeable between the amount of carbohydrates ingested and the amount of  glucose eliminated by the urine. He himself formulated the following general  principle: "The medical problem must first be posed so that it is given by  observation of the disease, and then the pathological phenomena must be  analyzed experimentally as one tries to provide a physiological explanation  for them" [6, 349] . Despite everything, it is still true that for Bernard the  pathological fact and its physiological explanation do not have the same </p><div id="pagenum"><p>74</p></div><p id="page">56 PART ONE  theoretical importance. The pathological fact accepts explanation more than  it stimulates it. This is even more obvious in the following text: "Diseases are  essentially nothing but physiological phenomena in new conditions which  have to be determined" [6, 346]. For whoever knows physiology, diseases  verify the physiology he knows, but essentially they teach him nothing;  phenomena are the same in the pathological state, save for conditions. As if  one could determine a phenomenon's essence apart from its conditions! As  if conditions were a mask or frame which changed neither the face nor the  picture! One should compare this proposition with that of Leriche cited  above in order to feel all the expressive importance of a verbal nuance: "At  every moment there lie within us many more physiological possibilities than  physiology tells us about. But it takes disease to reveal them to us."  Here again we owe to the chance of bibliographical research the intellec­ tual pleasure of stating once more that the most apparently paradoxical theses  also have their tradition which undoubtedly expresses their permanent logical  necessity. Just when Broussais was lending his authority to the theory which  established physiological medicine, this same theory was provoking the objec­ tions of an obscure physician, one Dr Victor Prus, who was rewarded by the  Societe de Medecine du Gard in 1821 for a report entered in a competition  whose object was the precise definition of the terms phlegmasia and irritation  and their importance for practical medicine. After having challenged the idea  that physiology by itself forms the natural foundation of medicine; that it  alone can ever establish the knowledge of symptoms, their relationships and  their value; that pathological anatomy can ever be deduced from the knowl­ edge of normal phenomena; that the prognosis of diseases derives from the  knowledge of physiological laws, the author adds:  If we want to exhaust the question dealt with in this article we would have to show that  physiology, far from being the foundation of pathology, could only arise in opposition  to it. It is through the changes which the disease of an organ and sometimes the com­ plete suspension of its activity transmit to its functions that we learn the organ's use and  importance .... Hence an exostosis, by compressing and paralyzing the optic nerve, the  brachial nerves, and the spinal cord, shows us their usual destination. Broussonnet lost  his memory of substantive words; at his death an abcess was found in the anterior part of  his brain and one was led to believe that that is the center for the memory of names ....  Thus pathology, aided by pathological anatomy, has created physiology: every day  pathology clears up physiology's former errors and aids its progress [95, L ).  In writing the Introduction a ['etude de fa medecine expbimentale, Claude  Bernard set out to assert not only that efficacious action is the same as sci­ ence, but also, and analogously, that science is identical with the discovery of </p><div id="pagenum"><p>75</p></div><p id="page">IMPLICATIONS OF THE THEORY 57  the laws of phenomena. On this point his agreement with Comte is total.  What Comte in his philosophical biology calls the doctrine of the conditions  of existence, Bernard calls determinism. He flatters himself with having been  the first to introduce that term into scientific French.  I believe I am the first to have introduced this word to science, but it has been used by  philosophers in another sense. It will be useful to determine the meaning of this word in  a book which I plan to write: Du determinisme dans les sciences ['On Determinism in  the Sciences']. This will amount to a second edition of my Introduction d fa medecine  expbimentale [103,96].  It is faith in the universal validity of the determinist postulate which is assert­ ed by the principle "physiology and pathology are one and the same thing".  At the very time that pathology was saddled with prescientific concepts, a  physical chemical physiology existed which met the demands of scientific  knowledge, that is, a physiology of quantitative laws verified by experimenta­ tion. Understandably, early nineteenth century physicians, justifiably eager  for an effective, rational pathology, saw in physiology the prospective model  which came closest to their ideal.  Science rejects the Indeterminate, and in medicine, when opinions are based on medical  palpation, inspiration, or a more or less vague intuition about things, we are outside of  science and are given the example of this medicine of fantasy, capable of presenting the  gravest perils as it delivers the health and lives of sick men to the whims of an inspired  ignoramus [6,96).  But just because, of the two -physiology and pathology -only the first  involved laws and postulated the determinism of its object, it was not neces­ sary to conclude that, given the legitimate desire for a rational pathology, the  laws and determinism of pathological facts are the same laws and determinism  of physiological facts. We know the antecedents of this point of doctrine from  Bernard himself. In the lecture devoted to the life and works of Magendie at  the beginning of the Lecons sur les substances toxiques et medicamenteuses  ['Lectures on toxic and medicinal substances'] (1857), Bernard tells us that  the teacher whose chair he occupies and whose teaching he continues "drew  the feeling of real science" from the illustrious Laplace. We know that La­ place had been Lavoisier's collaborator in the research on animal respiration  and animal heat, the first brilliant success in research on the laws of biological  phenomena following the experimental and measuring methods endorsed by  physics and chemistry. As a result of this work Laplace had retained a distinct  taste for physiology and he supported Magendie. If Laplace never used the  term 'determinism', he is one of its spiritual fathers and, at least in France, an </p><div id="pagenum"><p>76</p></div><p id="page">58 PART ONE  authoritative and authorized father of the doctrine designated by the term.  For Laplace determinism is not a methodological requirement, a normative re­ search postulate sufficiently flexible to prejudice in any way the form of the  results to which it leads: it is reality itself, complete, cast ne varietur in the  framework of Newtonian and Laplacian mechanics. Determinism can be con­ ceived as being open to incessant corrections of the formulas of laws and the  concepts they link together, or as being closed on its own assumed definitive  content. Laplace constructed the theory of closed determinism. Claude  Bernard did not conceive of it in any other way and this is undoubtedly why  he did not believe that the collaboration of pathology and physiology could  lead to a progressive rectification of physiological concepts. It is appropriate  here to recall Whitehead's dictum:  Every special science has to assume results from other sciences. For example, biology  presupposes physics. It will usually be the case that these loans really belong to the state  of science thirty or forty years earlier. The presuppositions of the physics of my boy­ hood are today powerful influences in the mentality of physiologists. 20  Finally, as a result of the determinist postulate, it is the reduction of  quality to quantity which is implied by the essential identity of physiology  and pathology. To reduce the difference between a healthy man and a diabe­ tic to a quantitative difference of the amount of glucose within the body; to  delegate the task of distinguishing one who is diabetic from one who is not to  a renal threshold conceived simply as a quantitative difference oflevel, means  obeying the spirit of the physical sciences which, in buttressing phenomena  with laws, can explain them only in terms of their reduction to a common  measure. In order to introduce terms into the relationships of composition  and dependence, the homogeneity of these terms should be obtained first.  As Emile Meyerson has shown, the human spirit attained knowledge by iden­ tifying reality and quantity. But it should be remembered that, though scien­ tific knowledge invalidates qualities, which it makes appear illusory, for all  that it does not annul them. Quantity is quality denied, but not quality sup­ pressed. The qualitative variety of simple lights, perceived as colors by the  human eye, is reduced by science to the quantitative difference of wave  lengths, but the qualitative variety still persists in the form of quantitative  differences in the calculation of wave lengths. Hegel maintains that, by its  growth or diminution, quantity changes into quality. This would be perfectly  inconceivable if a relation to quality did not still persist in the negated quality  which is called quantity. 21  From this point of view it is completely illegitimate to maintain that the </p><div id="pagenum"><p>77</p></div><p id="page">IMPLICATIONS OF THE THEORY S9  pathological state is really and simply a greater or lesser variation of the phy­ siological state. Either this physiological state is conceived as having one  quality and value for the living man, and so it is absurd to extend that value,  identical to itself in its variations, to a state called pathological whose value  and quantity are to be differentiated from and essentially contrasted with the  first. -Or what is understood as the physiological state is a simple summary  of quantities, without biological value, a simple fact or system of physical  and chemical facts, but as this state has no vital quality, it cannot be called  healthy or normal or physiological. Normal and pathological have no meaning  on a scale where the biological object is reduced to colloidal equilibria and  ionized solutions. In studying a state which he describes as physiological, the  physiologist qualifies it as such, even unconsciously; he considers this state as  positively qualified by and for the living being. Now this qualified physiologi­ cal state is not, as such, what is extended, identically to itself, to another  state capable of assuming, inexplicably, the quality of morbidity.  Of course this is not to say that an analysis of the conditions or products  of pathological functions will not give the chemist or physiologist numerical  results comparable to those obtained in a way consistent with the terms of  the same analyses concerning the corresponding, so-called physiological func­ tions. But it is arguable as to whether the terms more and less, once they  enter the definition of the pathological as a quantitative variation of the  normal, have a purely quantitative meaning. Also arguable is the logical  coherence of Bernard's principle: "The disturbance of a normal mechanism,  consisting in a quantitative variation, an exaggeration, or an attenuation,  constitutes the pathological state". As has been pOinted out in connection  with Broussais's ideas, in the order of physiological functions and needs, one  speaks of more and less in relation to a norm. For example, the hydration of  tissues is a fact which can be expressed in terms of more and less; so is the  percentage of calcium in blood. These quantitatively different results would  have no quality, no value in a laboratory, if the laboratory had no relation­ ship with a hospital or clinic where the results take on the value or not of  uremia, the value or not of tetanus. Because physiology stands at the cross­ roads of the laboratory and the clinic, two points of view about biological  phenomena are adopted there, but this does not mean that they can be inter­ changed. The substitution of quantitative progression for qualitative contrast  in no way annuls this opposition. It always remains at the back of the mind  of those who have chosen to adopt the theoretical and metrical point of view.  When we say that health and disease are linked by all the intermediaries, and  when this continuity is converted into homogeneity, we forget that the differ-</p><div id="pagenum"><p>78</p></div><p id="page">60 PART ONE  ence continues to manifest itself at the extreme, without which the inter­ mediaries could in no way play their mediating role; no doubt unconsciously,  but wrongly, we confuse the abstract calculation of identities and the con­ crete appreciation of differences. </p><div id="pagenum"><p>79</p></div><p id="page">PART TWO  DO SCIENCES OF THE NORMAL AND  THE PATHOLOGICAL EXIST? </p><div id="pagenum"><p>80</p></div><p id="page">INTRODUCTION TO THE PROBLEM  It is interesting to note that in their own discipline contemporary psychiatrists  have brought about a rectification and restatement of the concepts of normal  and pathological from which physicians and physiologists apparently have not  cared to draw a lesson concerning themselves. Perhaps the reason for this is to  be sought in the usually closer relations between psychiatry and philosophy  through the intermediary of psychology. In France, Blondel, Daniel Lagache,  and Eugene Minkowski in particular have contributed to a definition of the  general essence of the morbid or abnormal psychic fact and its relations with  the normal. In his La conscience morbide ['Morbid Consciousness' (Paris,  Alcan, 1914)], Blondel describes cases of insanity where the patients seem  incomprehensible to others as well as to themselves, where the doctor really  has the impression of dealing with another mental structure; he seeks the  explanation for this in the impossible situation where these patients translate  the data of their cenesthesia into the concepts of normal language. It is im­ possible for the physician, starting from the accounts of sick men, to under­ stand the experience lived by the sick man, for what sick men express in  ordinary concepts is not directly their experience but their interpretation of  an experience for which they have been deprived of adequate concepts.  Lagache is quite far from this pessimism. He thinks that a distinction must  be made in the abnormal consciousness between variations of nature and  variations of degree; in certain psychoses the patient's personality is hetero­ genous with the former personality, in others, one is the extension of the  other. Along with Jaspers, Lagache distinguishes incomprehensible psychoses  from comprehensible ones; in the latter case the psychosis seems to be intelli­ gibly related to the earlier psychic life. Hence, aside from difficulties posed  by the general problem of understanding others, psychopathology is a source  of documents which can be utilized in general psychology, a source of light to  be shed on normal consciousness [66,8.08-8]. But -and this is the point  we want to make -this position is quite different from Ribot's mentioned  above. Disease, according to Ribot, is a spontaneous and methodological sub­ stitute for experimentation, reaches the unreachable, but respects the nature  of the normal elements to which it reduces psychic functions. Disease dis­ organizes but does not transform, it reveals without altering. Lagache does  63 </p><div id="pagenum"><p>81</p></div><p id="page">64 PART TWO  not admit the assimilation of disease with experimentation. Experimentation  demands an exhaustive analysis of the phenomenon's conditions of existence  and a rigorous determination of the conditions which are made to vary in  order to observe the repercussions. On none of these points is mental illness  comparable with experimentation. First,  nothing is less well known than the conditions in which nature establishes these experi­ ences, these mental illnesses: the beginning of a psychosis most often escapes the notice  of the doctor, the patient, and those surrounding him; its physiopathology, its patho­ logical anatomy are obscure [66,8.08-5].  Later - at the basis of the illusion which assimilates the pathological method in psychology with  the experimental method, there is the atomistic and associationist representation of  mental life; this is the faculty psychology [ibid.].  As there are no separable elementary psychic facts, pathological symptoms  cannot be compared with elements of normal consciousness because a symp­ tom has a pathological significance only in its clinical context, which ex­ presses a global disturbance. For example, a verbal psychomotor hallucination  is involved in delirium and delirium is involved in an alteration of the person­ ality [66, 8.08-7]. Consequently general psychology can use psychopatho­ logical data in the same epistemolOgically valid way as facts observed in  normal people, but not without one express adaptation for the originality of  the pathological. Unlike Ribot, Lagache thinks that morbid disorganization is  not the symmetrical inverse of normal organization. Forms can exist in patho­ logical consciousness which have no equivalent in the normal state and yet  by which general psychology is enriched:  Even the most heterogeneous structures, beyond the intrinsic interest of their study, can  furnish data for problems posed by general psychology; they even pose new problems,  and a curious peculiarity of psychopathological vocabulary is its accomodation of nega­ tive expressions without equivalent in normal psychology: how can we fail to recognize  the new light thrown on our knowledge of the human being by ideas such as that of  discordance?" [66,8.08-8].  Minkowski also thinks that the fact of insanity cannot be reduced to just  the one fact of disease, determined by its reference to one image or precise  idea of the average or normal being. When we call another man insane, we do  so intuitively "as men, not as specialists". The madman is "out of his mind"  not so much in relation to other men as to life: he is not so much deviant as  different. "Through anomalies a human being detaches himself from every-</p><div id="pagenum"><p>82</p></div><p id="page">INTRODUCTION TO THE PROBLEM 65  thing which forms men and life. In a particularly radical and striking -and  therefore primitive -way they reveal to us the significance of an altogether  'singular' form of being. This circumstance explains why 'being sick' does not  at all exhaust the phenomenon of insanity, which, coming to our attention  from the perspective of 'being different' in the qualitative sense of the word,  directly opens the way to psychopathological considerations made from that  perspective" [84, 77] . According to Minkowski insanity or a psychic anomaly  presents its own features which he believes are not contained in the concept  of disease. First of all in an anomaly there is the primacy of the negative; evil  is detached from life while good is enmeshed with vital dynamism and finds  its meaning only "in a constant progression called to extend every conceptual  formula relative to this would-be norm" [84, 78]. Isn't it the same in the  realm of the body and there too doesn't one speak of health only because  diseases exist? But according to Minkowski mental illness is a more immedi­ ately vital category than disease: somatic disease is capable of a superior  empirical precision, of a better defined standardization; somatic disease does  not rupture the harmony between fellow creatures, the sick man is for us  what he is for himself, whereas the psychically abnormal has no consciousness  of his state. "The individual dominates the sphere of mental deviations much  more than he does in the somatic sphere" [84, 79] .  We do not share Minkowski's opinion on this last point. Like Leriche we  think that health is life in the silence of the organs, that consequently the  biologically normal, as we have already said, is revealed only through infrac­ tions of the norm and that concrete or scientific awareness of life exists only  through disease. We agree with Sigerist that "disease isolates" [107,86], and  that even if "this isolation does not alienate men but on the contrary brings  them closer to the sick man" [107,95]' no perceptive patient can ignore the  renunciations and limitations imposed by healthy men in order to come near  him. We agree with Goldstein that the norm in pathology is above all an in­ dividual norm [46,272]. In short we think that to consider life as a dynamic  force of transcendence as Minkowski does (whose sympathies for Bergsonian  philosophy are revealed in works such as La schizophrenie (Paris, Payot,  1927) or Le temps vecu (Neuchatel, Delachaux and Niestle, 1968; translated  as Lived Time, Evanston, Northwestern University Press, 1970) is to force  oneself to treat somatic anomaly and psychic anomaly in the same way. When  Ey, who approves Minkowski's views, states:  The normal is not a mean correlative to a social concept, it is not a judgment of reality  but rather a judgment of value; it is a limiting notion which defmes a being's maximum  psychic capacity. There is no upper limit to normality (84, 931, </p><div id="pagenum"><p>83</p></div><p id="page">66 PART TWO  we find it sufficient to replace 'psychic' with 'physical' in order to obtain a  very correct definition of the concept of the normal which the physiology  and medicine of organic diseases use every day without caring enough to state  its meaning precisely.  Moreover, this insouciance has good reasons behind it, particularly on the  part of the practicing physician. In the final analysis it is the patients who  most often decide -and from very different points of view -whether they  are no longer normal or whether they have returned to normality. For a man  whose future is almost always imagined starting from past experience, becom­ ing normal ag!\in means taking up an interrupted activity or at least an activity  deemed equivalent by individual tastes or the social values of the milieu. Even  if this activity is reduced, even if the possible behaviors are less varied, less  supple than before, the individual is not always so particular as all that. The  essential thing is to be raised from an abyss of impotence or suffering where  the sick man almost died; the essential thing is to have had a na"ow escape.  Take, for example, a young man examined recently, who fell on a moving  circular saw, whose arm was deeply cut cross-wise three-fourths the way up  but where the internal vascular nerve bundle was unharmed. A quick and  intelligent operation allowed the arm to be saved. The arm shows an atrophy  of all the muscles, including the forearm. The whole limb is cold, the hand is  cyanotic. When stimulated electrically, the group of extensor muscles shows a  distinctly degenerated reaction. The movements of flexion, extension, and  supination of the forearm are limited (flexion limited to 45°, extension to  about 170°); pronation is nearly normal. The patient is happy to know that  there is the possibility he will recover much of the use of his limb. Certainly,  with respect to the other arm, the injured and surgically restored arm will not  be normal from the trophic and functional point of view. But on the whole  the man will take up the trade again which he had chosen or which circum­ stances put forward, if not imposed; on which, in any case, he places a reason  -even a mediocre one -for living. From now on, even if this man obtains  equivalent technical results using different procedures of complex gesticula­ tion, socially he will continue to be appreciated according to former norms;  he will always be a cartwright or a driver and not a former cartwright or a  former driver. The sick man loses sight of the fact that because of his injury  he will from now on lack a wide range of neuro-muscular adaptations and  improvisations, that is, the capacity which perhaps he had never used to bet­ ter his output and surpass himself, but then only because of lack of oppor­ tunity. The sick man maintains that he is not in any obvious sense disabled.  This notion of disability should be studied by a medical expert who would </p><div id="pagenum"><p>84</p></div><p id="page">INTRODUCTION TO THE PR.OBLEM 67  not see in the organism merely a machine whose output must be calculated,  an expert who is enough of a psychologist to appreciate lesions as deteriora­ tions more than as percentages. 22* But in general the experts practice psy­ chology only in order to track down psychoses of reclaiming rights [psychoses  de revendication] in the subjects presented to them and to talk of pithiatism  [morbidity curable by suggestion] . Be that as it may, the practicing physic an  is very often happy to agree with his patients in defining the normal and  abnormal according to their individual norms, except, of course, in the case  of gross ignorance on their part of the minimal anatomical and physiological  conditions of plant or animal life. We remember having seen in surgical service  a simple-minded farmhand both of whose tibias had been fractured by a cart  wheel and whom his master had not had treated for fear of who knows what  responsibilities; the tibias had joined together by themselves at an obtuse  angle. The man had been sent to the hospital after the denunciation by neigh­ bors. It was necessary to rebreak his tibias and set them properly. It is clear  that the head of the department who made the decision had another image of  the human leg than that of that poor devil and his master. It is also clear that  he adopted a norm which would not have satisfied either a Jean Bouin  [French Olympic runner in 1912] or a Serge Lifar [dancer, choreographer,  and ballet master, Paris Opera Ballet, 1930-1958].  Jaspers saw clearly what difficulties lie in this medical determination of  the normal and health:  It is the physician who searches the least for the meaning of the words 'health and  disease'. He is concerned with vital phenomena from the scientific point of view. More  than the physicians' judgment, it is the patients' appraisal and the dominant ideas of the  social context, which determine what is called 'disease' [59,5).  What one finds in common in the different meanings given today or in the  past to the concept of disease is that they form a judgment of virtual value.  "Disease is a general concept of non-value which includes all possible negative  values" [59, 9]. To be sick is to be harmful or undesirable or socially de­ valued, etc. On the other hand from the physiological point of view what is  desired in health is obvious and this gives the concept of physical disease a  relatively stable meaning. Desirable values are "life, a long life, the capacity  for reproduction and for physical work, strength, resistance to fatigue, the  absence of pain, a state in which one notices the body as little as possible out­ side of the joyous sense of existence" [59,6]. However, medical science does  not consist in speculating about these common concepts in order to obtain  a general concept of disease; its real task is to determine what are the vital </p><div id="pagenum"><p>85</p></div><p id="page">68 PART TWO  phenomena with regard to which men call themselves sick, what are their  origins, their laws of evolution, the actions which modify them. The general  concept of value is specified in a multitude of concepts of existence. But  despite the apparent disappearance of any value judgment in these empirical  concepts, the physician persists in talking of diseases, because medical activ­ ity, through clinical questioning and therapeutics, has a relationship with the  patient and his value judgments [59,6].  It is perfectly understandable then that physicians are not interested in a  concept which seems to them to be too vulgar or too metaphysical. What  interests them is diagnOSis and cure. In principle, curing means restoring a  function or an organism to the norm from which they have deviated. The  physician usually takes the norm from his knowledge of physiology -called  the science of the normal man -from his actual experience of organic func­ tions, and from the common representation of the norm in a social milieu at  a given moment. Of the three authorities, physiology carries him furthest.  Modern physiology is presented as a canonical collection of functional con­ stants related to the hormonal and nervous functions of regulation. These  constants are termed normal insofar as they deSignate average characteristics,  which are most frequently practically observable. But they are also termed  normal because they enter ideally into that normative activity called thera­ peutics. Physiological constants are thus normal in the statistical sense, which  is a descriptive sense, and in the therapeutic sense, which is a normative sense.  But the question is whether it is medicine which converts -and how? - descriptive and purely theoretical concepts into biological ideals or whether  medicine, in admitting the notion of facts and constant functional coeffi­ cients from physiology would not also admit -probably unbeknownst to the  physiologists -the notion of norm in the normative sense of the word. And  it is a question of whether medicine, in doing this, wouldn't take back from  physiology what it itself had given. This is the difficult problem to examine  now. </p><div id="pagenum"><p>86</p></div><p id="page">II  A CRITICAL EXAM INA TION OF CERTAIN CONCEPTS:  THE NORMAL, ANOMALY, AND DISEASE;  THE NORMAL AND THE EXPERIMENTAL  tittre and Robin's Dictionnaire de medecine defines the normal as follows:  normal (normalis, from norma, rule): that which conforms to the rule, regu­ lar. The brevity of this entry in a medical dictionary does not surprise us  given the observations we have just made. Lalande's Vocabulaire technique et  critique de la philosophie is more explicit. Since norma, etymologically,  means a T-square, normal is that which bends neither to the right nor left,  hence that which remains in a happy medium; from which two meanings are  derived: (1) normal is that which is such that it ought to be; (2) normal, in  the most usual sense of the word, is that which is met with in the majority of  cases of a determined kind, or that which constitutes either the average or  standard of a measurable characteristic. In the discussion of these meanings  it has been pointed out how ambiguous this term is since it designates at once  a fact and "a value attributed to this fact by the person speaking, by virtue  of an evaluative judgment for which he takes responsibility". One should also  stress how this ambiguity is deepened by the realist philosophical tradition  which holds that, as every generality is the sign of an essence, and every per­ fection the realization of the essence, a generality observable in fact takes the  value of realized perfection, and a common characteristic, the value of an  ideal type. Finally, an analogous confusion in medicine should be emphasized,  where the normal state designates both the habitual state of the organs, and  their ideal, since the reestablishment of this habitual ideal is the ordinary aim  of therapeutics [67].  It seems to us that this last remark has not been developed as it should be  and that, in particular, in the entry cited, not enough has been deduced from  it concerning the ambiguity of meaning in the term normal where one is  happy to point out its existence rather than see in it a problem to solve. It is  true that in medicine the normal state of the human body is the state one  wants to reestablish. But is it because therapeutics aims at this state as a good  goal to obtain that it is called normal, or is it because the interested party,  that is, the sick man, considers it normal that therapeutics aim at it? We hold  the second statement to be true. We think that medicine exists as the art of  life because the living human being himself calls certain dreaded states or  behaviors pathological (hence requiring avoidance or correction) relative to  69 </p><div id="pagenum"><p>87</p></div><p id="page">70 PART TWO  the dynamic polarity of life, in the form of a negative value. We think that  in doing this the living human being, in a more or less lucid way, extends a  spontaneous effort, peculiar to life, to struggle against that which obstructs  its preservation and development taken as norms. The entry in the Voca­ bulaire philosophique seems to assume that value can be attributed to a  biological fact only by 'him who speaks', obviously a man. We, on the other  hand, think that the fact that a living man reacts to a lesion, infection, func­ tional anarchy by means of a disease, expresses the fundamental fact that life  is not indifferent to the conditions in which it is possible, that life is polarity  and thereby even an unconscious position of value; in short, life is in fact a  normative activity. Normative, in philosophy, means every judgment which  evaluates or qualifies a fact in relation to a norm, but this mode of judgment  is essentially subordinate to that which establishes norms. Normative, in the  fullest sense of the word, is that which establishes norms. And it is in this  sense that we plan to talk about biological normativity. We think that we are  as careful as anyone as far as the tendency to fall into anthropomorphism is  concerned. We do not ascribe a human content to vital norms but we do ask  ourself how normativity essential to human consciousness would be explained  if it did not in some way exist in embryo in life. We ask ourself how a human  need for therapeutics would have engendered a medicine which is increasingly  clairvoyant with regard to the conditions of disease if life's struggle against  the innumerable dangers threatening it were not a permanent and essential  vital need. From the sociological point of view it can be shown that thera­ peutics was first a religious, magical activity, but this does not negate the fact  that therapeutic need is a vital need, which, even in lower living organisms  (with respect to vertebrate structure) arouses reactions of hedonic value or  self-healing or self-restoring behaviors.  The dynamic polarity of life and the normativity it expresses account for  an epistemological fact of whose important significance Bichat was fully  aware. Biological pathology exists but there is no physical or chemical or  mechanical pathology:  There are two things in the phenomena of life: (1) the state of health; (2) the state of  disease, and from these two distinct sciences derive: physiology, which concerns itself  with the phenomena of the first state, pathology, with those of the second. The history  of phenomena in which vital forces have their natural form leads us, consequently, to  the history of phenomena where these forces are changed. Now, in the physical sciences  only the first history exists, never the second. Physiology is to the movement of living  bodies what astronomy, dynamics, hydraulics, hydrostatics, etc. are to inert ones: these  last have no science at all which corresponds to them as pathology corresponds to the </p><div id="pagenum"><p>88</p></div><p id="page">A CRITICAL EXAMINATION OF CONCEPTS 71  fllst. For the same reason the whole idea of medication is distasteful to the physical  sciences. Any medication aims at restoring certain properties to their natural type: as  physical properties never lose this type, they do not need to be restored to it. Nothing  in the physical sciences corresponds to what is therapeutics in the physiological sciences  [13,1,20-21).  It is clear from this text that natural type must be taken in the sense of  normal type. For Bichat the natural is not the effect of a determinism, but  the term of a finality. And we know well everything that can be found wrong  in such a text from the point of view of a mechanist or materialist biology.  One. might say that long ago Aristotle believed in a pathological mechanics  since he admitted two kinds of movements: natural movements through  which a body regains its proper place where it thrives at rest, as a stone goes  down to the ground, and fire, up to the sky; -and violent movements by  which a body is pushed from its proper place, as when a stone is thrown in  the air. It can be said that with Galileo and Descartes, progress in knowledge  of the physical world consisted in considering all movements as natural, that  is, as conforming to the laws of nature, and that likewise progress in biological  knowledge consisted in unifying the laws of natural life and pathological life.  It is precisely this unification which Comte dreamed of and Claude Bernard  flattered himself with having accomplished, as was seen above. To the reserva­ tions which we felt obliged to set forth at that time, let us add this. In estab­ lishing the science of movement on the principle of inertia, modern mechanics  in effect made the distinction between natural and violent movements absurd,  as inertia is precisely an indifference with respect to directions and variations  in movement. Ufe is far removed from such an indifference to the conditions  which are made for it; life is polarity. The simplest biological nutritive system  of assimilation and excretion expresses a polarity. When the wastes of diges­ tion are no longer excreted by the organism and congest or poison the internal  environment, this is all indeed according to law (physical, chemical, etc.) but  none of this follows the norm, which is the activity of the organism itself.  This is the simple fact that we want to point out when we speak of biological  normativity.  There are some thinkers whose horror of finalism leads them to reject even  the Darwinian idea of selection by the environment and struggle for existence  because of both the term selection, obviously of human and technological  import, and the idea of advantage which comes into the explanation of the  mechanism of natural selection. They point out that most living beings are  killed by the environment long before the inequalities which they can produce  even have a chance to be of use to them because it kills above all sprouts, </p><div id="pagenum"><p>89</p></div><p id="page">72 PART TWO  embryos or the young. But as Georges Teissier observed, the fact that many  organisms die before their inequalities serve them does not mean that the  presentation of inequalities is biologically indifferent [111]. This is precisely  the one fact we ask to be granted. There is no biological indifference, and  consequently we can speak of biological normativity. There are healthy bio­ logical norms and these are pathological norms, and the second are not the  same as the first.  We did not refer to the theory of natural selection unintentionally. We  want to draw attention to the fact that what is true of the expression, natural  selection, is also true of the old expression vis medicatrix naturae. Selection  and medicine are biological techniques practiced deliberately and more or less  rationally by man. When we speak of natural selection or natural medicinal  activity we are victims of what Bergson calls the illusion of retroactivity if we  imagine that vital prehuman activity pursues goals and utilizes means compara­ ble to those of men. But it is one thing to think that natural selection would  utilize anything that resembles pedigrees, and vis medicatrix, cupping glasses,  and another to think that human technique extends vital impulses, at whose  service it tries to place systematic knowledge which would deliver them from  much of life's costly trial and error.  The expressions 'natural selection' and 'natural medicinal activity' have  one drawback in that they seem to set vital techniques within the framework  of human techniques when it is the opposite which seems true. All human  technique, including that of life, is set within life, that is, within an activity of  information and assimilation of material. It is not because human technique  is normative that vital technique is judged such by comparison. Because life  is activity of information and assimilation it is the root of all technical activ­ ity. In short, we speak of natural medicine in quite a retroactive and, in one  sense, mistaken way, but even if we were to assume that we have no right to  speak of it, we are still free to think that no living being would have ever  developed medical technique if the life within him -as within every living  thing -were indifferent to the conditions it met with, if life were not a form  of reactivity polarized to the variations of the environment in which it de­ velops. This was seen very well by Guyenot:  It is a fact that the organism has an aggregate of properties which belong to it alone,  thanks to which it withstands multiple destructive forces. Without these defensive reac­ tions, life would be rapidly extinguished .... The living being is able to find instanta­ neously the reaction which is useful vis-a-vis substances with which neither it nor its kind  has ever had contact. The organism is an incomparable chemist. It is the fust among phy­ sicians. The fluctuations of the environment are almost always a menace to its existence. </p><div id="pagenum"><p>90</p></div><p id="page">A CRITICAL EXAMINATION OF CONCEPTS 73  The living being could not survive if it did not possess certain essential properties. Every  injury would be fatal if tissues were incapable of forming scars and blood incapable of  clotting [52, 186).  By way of summary, we think it very instructive to consider the meaning  that the word 'normal' assumes in medicine, and the fact that the concept's  ambiguity, pointed out by Lalande, is greatly clarified by this, with a quite  general significance for the problem of the normal. It is life itself and not  medical judgJ:Ilent which makes the biological normal a concept of value and  not a concept of statistical reality. For the physician, life is not an object but  rather a polarized activity, whose spontaneous effort of defense and struggle  against all that is of negative value is extended by medicine by bringing to  bear the relative but indispensable light of human science.  Lalande's Vocabulaire philosophique contains an important remark about  the terms anomaly and abnormal. Anomaly is a substantive with no corres­ ponding adjective at present; abnormal, on the other hand, is an adjective  with no substantive, so that [French] usage has coupled them, making ab­ normal the adjective of anomaly. It is quite true that 'anomalous' [Fr.:  anomal] , which Isidore Geoffroy Saint-Hilaire was still using in 1836 in his  Histoire des anomalies de ['organisation and which also appears in Littn! and  Robin's Dictionnaire de medecine, has fallen into disuse. Lalande's Vocabu­ /aire shows that confusion of an etymolOgical nature has helped draw anomaly  and abnormal closer together. 'Anomaly' comes from the Greek anomalia  which means unevenness, asperity; omalos in Greek means that which is level,  even, smooth, hence 'anomaly' is, etymologically, an-omalos, that which is  uneven, rough, irregular, in the sense given these words when speaking of a  terrain. 23 A mistake is often made with the etymology of 'anomaly', by  deriving it not from omalos but from nomos which means law, hence the  compound a-nomos. This etymological error is found right in Littre and  Robin's Dictionnaire de medecine. The Greek nomos and the Latin norma  have closely related meanings, law and rule tending to become confused.  Hence, in a strictly semantic sense 'anomaly' points to a fact, and is a descrip­ tive term, while 'abnormal' implies reference to a value and is an evaluative,  normative term; but the switching of good grammatical methods has meant a  confusion of the respective meanings of anomaly and abnormal. 'Abnormal'  has become a descriptive concept and 'anomaly', a normative one. Geoffroy  Saint-Hilaire, who makes the etymological error repeated after him by Littre  and Robin, tries to maintain the purely descriptive and theoretical meaning  of 'anomaly', which is a biological fact and must be treated as such, that is, it </p><div id="pagenum"><p>91</p></div><p id="page">74 PART TWO  must be explained, not evaluated, by natural science:  The word anomaly, like the word i"egularity, must never be taken in the sense which  would be deduced literally from its etymological composition. There are no organic  formations which are not subject to laws; and the word disorder, taken in its real sense,  would not be applicable to any productions of nature. 'Anomaly' is an expression which  has been recently introduced into anatomical language, whose use there is even infre­ quent. On the other hand, the zoologists from whom it was borrowed, use it very often;  they apply it to a large number of animals, who, because of their unusual organization  and features, find themselves isolated, so to speak, in the series and have only very dis­ tant kinship with others in the same class [43,1, 96,37].  According to Geoffroy Saint-Hilaire, it is wrong to speak of either peculiari­ ties of nature, or disorder or irregularity with regard to such animals. If there  is an exception, it is to the laws of naturalists, not to the laws of nature, for  in nature all species are what they must be, equally presenting variety in unity  and unity in variety [43, 1,37]. In anatomy the term 'anomaly' must strictly  maintain its meaning of unusual, unaccustomed; to be anomalous is to be  removed, in terms of one's organization, from the vast majority of beings to  which one must be compared [ibid.].  Having defined anomaly in general from the morphological point of view,  Geoffroy Saint-Hilaire relates it directly to two biological facts, the specific  type and individual variation. On the one hand all living species present for  examination a multitude of variations in the form and proportional volume of  organs; on the other hand there is a complex of traits "common to the vast  majority of individuals who compose a species" and this complex defines the  specific type. "Every deviation of the specific type, or in other words, every  organic particularity introduced by an individual when compared with the  vast majority of the individuals of his species, age, and sex, constitutes what  can be called an Anomaly" [43,1, 30]. It is clear that, so defmed, anomaly  is, generally speaking, a purely empirical or descriptive concept, a statistical  deviation.  One problem which immediately presents itself is whether the concepts  anomaly and monstrosity must be considered equivalent. Geoffroy Saint­ Hilaire is on the side of distinction: monstrosity is one species of the genus  anomaly. Whence the division of anomalies into Varieties, Structural defects,  Heterotaxy, and Monstrosities. Varieties are simple, slight anomalies which do  not obstruct the performance of any function and produce no deformity; for  example: a supernumerary muscle, a double renal artery. Structural defects  are simple anomalies, slight in terms of the anatomical relationship, but they  make the performance of one or more functions impossible or produce a </p><div id="pagenum"><p>92</p></div><p id="page">A CRITICAL EXAMINATION OF CONCEPTS 75  deformity; for example, a defective anus, hypospadias, or harelip. Hetero­ taxies, a term created by Geoffroy Saint-Hilaire, are complex anomalies,  serious in appearance in terms of the anatomical relationship, but they im­ pede no function and are not apparent on the outside; the most remarkable,  though rare, example, according to Geoffroy Saint-Hilaire, is the complete  transposition of the viscera or situs in versus. We know that, while rare, the  heart on the right-hand side is no myth. Finally, Monstrosities are very com­ plex anomalies, very serious, making the performance of one or more func­ tions impossible or difficult, or producing in the individuals so affected a  defect in structure very different from that ordinarily found in their species;  for example, ectromelia or cyclopia [43, 1,33,39-49].  The interest of such a classification lies in the fact that it utilizes two  different principles of discrimination and hierarchy: anomalies are arranged  in terms of their increasing complexity and increasing seriousness. The  simplicity-complexity relationship is purely objective. It goes without saying  that a cervical rib is a simpler anomaly than ectromelia or hermaphroditism.  The slight-serious relationship has a less clearcut logical character. Undoubt­ edly the gravity of anomalies is an anatomical fact; the criterion of the  anomaly's gravity lies in the importance of the organ as far as its phYSiological  or anatomical· connections are concerned [43, I, 49]. For the naturalist im­ portance is an objective idea, but it is essentially a subjective one in the sense  that it includes a reference to the life of a living being, considered fit to  qualify this same life according to what helps or hinders it. This is so true that  Geoffroy Saint-Hilaire added a third prinCiple of classification (a physiologi­ cal one) to the first two (complexity, gravity), that is, the relationship be­ tween anatomy and the exercise of functions (obstacle), and then a fourth,  which is patently psychological, the introduction of the idea of a harmful or  disturbing influence on the exercise of functions [43, I, 38, 39, 41, 49]. If  one were tempted to accord this last principle only a subordinate role, let us  reply that the case ofheterotaxies emphasizes on the contrary both its precise  meaning and considerable biological value. Geoffroy Saint-Hilaire created  this term to designate modifications in the inner organization, that is, in the  relations of the viscera without modification of the functions and external  appearance. Until then these cases had not been studied much and constituted  a gap in anatomical language. This should not be surprising, although it is  difficult to imagine the possibility of a complex anomaly which not only does  not obstruct the smallest function but also does not even produce the slight­ est deformity. "An individual affected by heterotaxy can enjoy very robust  health; he can live a very long time; and often it is only after his death that </p><div id="pagenum"><p>93</p></div><p id="page">76 PART TWO  the presence of an anomaly is noticed, of which he himself had been un­ aware" [43, I, 45, 46]. This amounts to saying that the anomaly is ignored  insofar as there is no manifestation of it in the order of vital values. Thus,  even a scientist acknowledges that an anomaly is known to science only if it  is first perceived in the consciousness, in the form of an obstacle to the per­ formance of functions, or discomfort or harmfulness. But the sensation of  obstacle, discomfort, or harmfulness is a sensation which must be termed  normative since it involves the even unconscious reference to a function and  to an impulse to the completeness of their exercise. Finally in order to be  able to speak of an anomaly using scientific language, a being must have  appeared to himself or to another as abnormal in the albeit unformulated  language of the living. As long as the anomaly has no functional repercussions  experienced consciously by the individual, in the case of man, or ascribed to  life's dynamic polarity in every other living thing, the anomaly is either  ignored (in the case of heterotaxies) or constitutes an indifferent variety, a  variation on a specific theme; it is an irregularity like the negligible irregulari­ ties found in objects cast in the same mould. It might form the subject of a  special chapter in natural history, but not in pathology.  On the other hand, if we assume that the history of anomalies and terato­ logy are a necessary chapter in the biological sciences, expressing the original­ ity of these sciences -for there is no special science of chemical or physical  anomalies -it is because a uew point of view can appear in biology and carve  out new territory there. This point of view is that of vital nonnativity. Even  for an amoeba, living means preference and exclusion. A digestive tract, sexual  organs, constitute an organism's behavioral norms. Psychoanalytic language is  indeed right to give the name poles to the natural orifices of ingestion and  excretion. A function does not work indifferently in several directions. A  need places the proposed objects of satisfaction in relation to propulsion and  repulsion. There is a dynamic polarity of life. As long as the morphological  or functional variations on the specific type do not hinder or subvert this  polarity, the anomaly is a tolerated fact; in the opposite case the anomaly  is felt as having negative vital value and is expressed as such on the outside.  Because there are anomalies which are experienced or revealed as an organic  disease, there exists first an affective and then a theoretical interest in them.  It is because the anomaly has become pathological that it stimulates scientific  study. The scientist, from his objective point of view, wants to see the anoma­ ly as a mere statistical divergence, ignoring the fact that the biologist's'scien­ tific interest was stimulated by the normative divergence. In short, not all  anomalies are pathological but only the existence of pathological anomalies </p><div id="pagenum"><p>94</p></div><p id="page">A CRITICAL EXAMINATION OF CONCEPTS 77  has given rise to a special science of anomalies which, because it is science,  normally tends to rid the definition of anomaly of every implication of a  normative idea. Statistical divergences such as simple varieties are not what  one thinks of when one speaks of anomalies; instead one thinks of harmful  deformities or those even incompatible with life, as one refers to the living  form or behavior of the living being not as a statistical fact but as a normative  type of life.  An anomaly ,is a fact of individual variation which prevents two beings from  being able to take the place of each other completely. It illustrates the Leib­ nizean principle of indiscernables in the biological order. But diversity is not  disease; the anomalous is not the pathological. Pathological implies pathos,  the direct and concrete feeling of suffering and impotence, the feeling of life  gone wrong. But the pathological is indeed abnormal. Rabaud distinguishes  between abnormal and sick because, following recent, incorrect usage, he  makes 'abnormal' the adjective of 'anomaly' and in this sense speaks of ab­ normal sick people [97, 481] ; but as he distinguishes very clearly in other  respects between disease and anomaly [97,477], following the criterion given  for adaptation and viability, we see no reason to modify our distinctions of  words and meanings.  Without doubt there is one way to consider the pathological normal, and  that is by defining normal and abnormal in terms of relative statistical fre­ quency. In a sense one could say that continual perfect health is abnormal.  But that is because the word 'health' has two meanings. Health, taken abso­ lutely, is a normative concept defining an ideal type of organic structure and  behavior; in this sense it is a pleonasm to speak of good health because health  is organic well-being. Qualified health is a descriptive concept, defining an  individual organism's particular disposition and reaction with regard to pos­ sible diseases. The two concepts, qualified descriptive and absolute normative,  are so completely distinct that the same people will say of their neighbor that  he has poor health or that he is not healthy, considering the presence of a fact  the same as the absence of a value. When we say that continually perfect  health is abnormal, we are expressing the fact that the experience of the living  indeed includes disease. Abnormal means precisely non-existent, inobservable.  Hence it is only another way of saying that continual health is a norm and  that a norm does not exist. In this misconstrued sense, it is obvious that the  pathological is not abnormal. This is so little true that we can speak of the  normal functions of organic defense and struggle against disease. As we have  seen, Leriche asserts that pain is not in nature's plan, but we could say that </p><div id="pagenum"><p>95</p></div><p id="page">78 PART TWO  disease is foreseen by the organism (Sendrail 106). With regard to the anti­ bodies which are a defensive reaction against a pathological inoculation, Jules  Bordet thinks that one can speak of normal antibodies which exist in normal  serum acting electively on microbe and antigen, whose multiple specificities  help assure the constancy of the organism's chemical characteristics by elimi­ nating that which is not compatible with them [15, 6.16-14] . But although  disease may appear as foreseen, it is nonetheless true that it is like a state  against which it is necessary to struggle in order to be able to go on living,  that is, it is like an abnormal state in terms of the persistence of life which  here serves as a norm. Hence in taking the word 'normal' in its authentic sense  we must set up an equation between the concepts of sick, pathological, and  abnormal.  Another reason for avoiding confusion between anomaly and disease is  that human attention is not sensitized to each as being divergences of the  same kind. An anomaly manifests itself in spatial multiplicity, disease, in  chronological succession. It is a characteristic of disease that it interrupts a  course; in fact it is critical. Even when the disease becomes chronic, after  having been critical, there is a past for which the patient or those around him  remain nostalgic. Hence we are sick in relation not only to others but also to  ourselves. This is the case with pneumonia, arteritis, sciatica, aphasia, nephri­ tis, etc. It is the characteristic of an anomaly that it is constitutional, congeni­ tal, even if its appearance is uelayed with respect to birth and is contemporary  only with the performance of a function -for example, in the congenital  dislocation of the hip. The person with an anomaly cannot then be compared  to himself. It could be pointed out here that the teratogenic interpretation of  teratological characteristics, and better yet their teratogenetic explanation  allow the placement of the anomaly's appearance in embryological develop­ ment and give it the significance of a disease. Once the etiology and pathology  of an anomaly are known, the anomalous becomes pathological. Experimental  teratogenesis provides some useful insights here [120]. But if this conversion  of an anomaly into disease makes sense in the science of embryology, it  makes no sense for the living being whose behavior in the environment, out­ side of the egg or uterus, is fixed at the outset by its structural characteristics.  When an anomaly is interpreted in terms of its effects in relation to the  individual's activity and hence to the representation which develops from its  value and destiny, an anomaly is an infirmity. Infirmity is a vulgar but instruc­ tive notion. One is born or one becomes infirm. It is the fact of becoming  infirm which, interpreted as an irremediable breakdown, has repercussions  for the fact of being born that way. For an invalid there exists in the end the </p><div id="pagenum"><p>96</p></div><p id="page">A CRITICAL EXAMINATION OF CONCEPTS 79  possibility of some activity and an honorable social role. But a human being's  forced limitation to a unique and invariable condition is judged pejoratively  in terms of the normal human ideal, which is the potential and deliberate  adaptation to every condition imaginable. It is the possible abuse of health  which lies at the bottom of the value accorded to health just as it is the abuse  of power which, according to Valery, lies at the bottom of the love of power.  Normal man is normative man, the being capable of establishing new, even  organic norms. A single norm in life is felt privately, not positively. A man  who cannot run feels injured, that is, he converts his injury into frustration,  and although those around him avoid throwing up to him the image of his  incapacity, just as sensitive children avoid running when a lame child is with  them, the invalid feels senSitively by what restraint and avoidance on the part  of his fellows each difference between him and them is apparently cancelled  out.  What holds true for infirmity also holds true for certain states of fragility  and debility, linked to a type of physiological divergence. This is the case  with hemophilia, which is more an anomaly than a disease. All of the hemo­ philiac's functions are carried out like those of healthy individuals. But the  hemorrhages are interminable, as if the blood were indifferent to its situation  inside or outside the vessels. In short, the hemophiliac's life would be normal  if animal life did not normally involve relations with an environment, rela­ tions whose risks in the form of injuries must be met by the animal in order  to compensate for the disadvantages in feeding derived from the break with  the inactive, vegetarian life; a break which, in other respects, particularly in  terms of the development of consciousness, constitutes real progress. Hemo­ philia is a kind of anomaly with a possible pathological character because of  the obstacle met here by an essential vital function, the strict separation of  interior and exterior environment.  By way of summary: an anomaly can shade into disease but does not in  itself constitute one. It is not easy to determine at what moment an anomaly  turns into disease. Must the sacralization of the fifth lumbar vertebra be con­ sidered a pathological fact or not? There are certainly degrees of this mal­ formation. Only the fifth vertebra must be termed sacralized when it is fused  with the sacrum. Besides, in this case it rarely causes pain. Simple hypertro­ phy of a transverse apophysis, its more or less real contact with the sacral  tubercle, are often deemed responsible for imaginary ills. In short, we are  dealing with anatomical anomalies of a congential kind which become painful  only later and sometimes never [10 I] . </p><div id="pagenum"><p>97</p></div><p id="page">80 ·PART TWO  The problem of distinguishing between an anomaly -whether morphological  like the cervical rib or sacralization of the fifth lumbar, or functional like  hemophilia, hemeralopia, or pentosuria -and the pathological state is not at  all a clear one; but it is nevertheless quite important from the biological point  of view because in the end it leads us to nothing less than the general problem  of the variability of organisms and the significance and scope of this variabil­ ity. To the extent that living beings diverge from the specific type, are they  abnormal in that they endanger the specific form or are they inventors on the  road to new forms? One looks at a living being having some new characteristic  with a different eye depending on whether one is a fOOst [fixiste] or a trans­ formist. Understandably we haven't the slightest intention of dealing with  such a problem here, though we cannot pretend to ignore it. When a droso­ phila with wings gives birth, through mutation, to a drosophila without wings  or with vestigial wings, are we being confronted with a pathological fact or  not? Biologists like Caullery, who do not admit that mutations are adequate  for an understanding of the facts of adaptation and evolution, or like Bou­ noure, who dispute even the fact of evolution, insist on the sub pathological  or frankly pathological and even lethal character of most mutations. If they  are not flXists like Bounoure [16] they at least agree with Caullery that  mutations do not go beyond the framework of the species, since, despite  considerable morphological differences, fertile crossbreeding is possible be­ tween control and mutual individuals [24, 414] . It still seems indisputable  that mutations can be the origin of new species. This fact was already well  known to Darwin but it struck him less than individual variability. GUY(lOOt  thinks that it is the only presently known mode of hereditary variation, the  only explanation, partial but unquestionable, of evolution [51]. Teissier and  Philippe L'Heritier have demonstrated experimentally that certain mutations,  which can seem disadvantageous in a species's usually appropriate environ­ ment, can become advantageous should certain conditions of existence vary.  In a free and closed environment drosophila with vestigial wings are wiped  out by drosophila with normal wings. But in an open environment the vesti­ gial drosophila do not fly, feed constantly, and in three generations we see  sixty per cent vestigial drosophila in a mixed population [77]. This never  happens in a closed environment. Let us not say normal environment because  in the end, according to Geoffroy Saint-Hilaire, what is true of species is also  true of environments: they are all that they must be as a function of natural  laws, and their stability is not guaranteed. An open seashore environment is  an indisputable fact, but this will be a more normal environment for wingless  insects than for winged ones because those who do not fly are less likely to be </p><div id="pagenum"><p>98</p></div><p id="page">A CRITICAL EXAMINATION OF CONCEPTS 81  eliminated. Darwin had noticed this fact, which was not taken seriously and  which is confirmed and explained by the experiments reported above. An  environment is normal because a living being lives out its life better there,  maintains its own norm better there. An environment can be called normal  with reference to the living species using it to its advantage. It is normal only  in terms of a morphological and functional norm.  Teissier reports another fact which shows that, perhaps without looking  for it, life, usi~g the variation of living forms, obtains a kind of insurance  against excessive specialization without reversibility, hence without flexibility,  which is essentially a successful adaptation. In certain industrial districts in  Germany and England the gradual disappearance of grey butterflies and the  appearance of black ones of the same species has been observed. It was pos­ sible to establish that in these butterflies the black coloration was accom­ panied by an unusual vigor. In captivity the blacks eliminate the greys. Why  isn't the same true in nature? Because their color stands out more against the  bark of the trees and attracts the attention of birds. When the number of  birds diminishes in industrial regions, butterflies can be black with impunity  [111]. In short this butterfly species, in the form of varieties, offers two  combinations of opposing characteristics and they balance each other: more  vigor is balanced by less security and vice versa. In each of the variations an  obstacle has been circumvented, to use a Bergsonian expression, a powerless­ ness has been overcome. To the extent that circumstances allow one such  morphological solution to operate in preference to another, the number of  representatives of each variety varies, and a variety tends more and more  toward a species.  Mutationism was first presented as a form of explanation for the facts of  evolution, whose adoption by geneticists further reinforced the hostility  shown toward every consideration of the influence of the environment. To­ day it seems that the appearance of new species must be placed at the inter­ section of innovations brought about by mutations and oscillations in the  environment; and that a Darwinism rejuvenated by mutationism is the most  flexible and comprehensive explanation of the fact of evolution -indisputa­ ble despite everything [56, 111]. The species is the grouping of individuals,  all of whom are different to some degree, whose unity expresses the momen­ tary normalization of their relations with the environment, including other  species, as Darwin had clearly seen. Taken separately, the living being and his  environment are not normal: it is their relationship that makes them such.  For any given form of life the environment is normal to the extent that it  allows it fertility and a corresponding variety of forms such that, should </p><div id="pagenum"><p>99</p></div><p id="page">82 PART TWO  changes in the environment occur, life will be able to find the solution to the  problem of adaptation -which it has been brutally forced to resolve -in one  of these forms. A living being is normal in any given environment insofar as it  is the morphological and functional solution found by life as a response to  the demands of the environment. Even if it is relatively rare, this living being  is normal in terms of every other form from which it diverges, because in  terms of those other forms it is normative, that is, it devaluates them before  eliminating them.  Hence, finally, we see how an anomaly, particularly a mutation, i.e., a  directly hereditary anomaly, is not pathological because it is an anomaly, that  is, a divergence from a specific type, which is defined as a group of the most  frequent characteristics in their average dimension. Otherwise it would have  to be said that a mutant individual, as the point of departure for a new  species, is both pathological, because it is a divergence, and normal, because  it maintains itself and reproduces. In biology the normal is not so much the  old as the new form, if it finds conditions of existence in which it will appear  normative, that is, displacing all withered, obsolete, and perhaps soon to be  extinct forms.  No fact termed normal, because expressed as such, can usurp the prestige  of the norm of which it is the expression, starting from the moment when the  conditions in which it has been referred to the norm are no longer given.  There is no fact which is normal or pathological in itself. An anomaly or a  mutation is not in itself pathological. These two express other possible norms  of life. If these norms are inferior to specific earlier norms in terms of stabil­ ity, fecondity, variability of life, they will be called pathological. If these  norms in the same environment should turn out to be equivalent, or in an­ other environment, superior, they will be called normal. Their normality will  come to them from their normativity. The pathological is not the absence of  a biological norm; it is another norm but one which is, comparatively speak­ ing, pushed aside by life.  Here we have a new problem which leads us to the heart of our concerns and  that is the relationship of the normal and the experimental. What physio­ logists after Bernard understand as normal phenomena are phenomena whose  continuous exploration is possible thanks to laboratory equipment, and  whose measured characteristics for any given individual in given conditions  turn out to be identical to themselves; and, aside from some divergences of a  clearly defined amplitUde, identical from one individual to another in identi­ cal conditions. It would seem then that there is one possible definition of the </p><div id="pagenum"><p>100</p></div><p id="page">A CRITICAL EXAMINATION OF CONCEPTS 83  normal, objective and absolute, starting from which every deviation beyond  certain limits would logically be assessed as pathological. In what sense are  laboratory standarization and mensuration appropriate to serve as the norm  for the living being's functional activity considered outside the laboratory?  First of all, it should be pointed out that the physiologist, like the phy­ sicist and chemist, sets up experiments whose results he compares using this  fundamental mental reservation that these data are valid "all other things  being equal". In other words other conditions would give rise to other norms.  The living being's functional norms as examined in the laboratory are mean­ ingful only within the framework of the scientist's operative norms. In this  sense no physiologist would dispute the fact that he gives only a content to  the concept of the biological norm but that in no case does he work out in  what way such a concept is normative. Having admitted that some conditions  are normal, the physiologist objectively studies the relations which actually  define the corresponding phenomena, but he does not really objectively de­ fine which conditions are normal. Unless one admits that an experiment's  conditions have no influence on the quality of the result -which is inconsis­ tent with the care taken to determine them -one cannot deny the difficulty  in assimilating experimental conditions with the normal ones of animal and  human life, in the statistical as well as in the normative sense. If the abnormal  or pathological is defined as a statistical divergence or as something unusual,  as the physiologist usually defines it, it must be said, from a purely objective  point of view, that the laboratory's conditions for examination place the  living being in a pathological situation from which, paradoxically, one claims  to draw conclusions having the weight of a norm. We know that this objection  is very often directed at physiology, even in medical circles. Prus, in the same  work from which we have already quoted a passage attacking Broussais's  theories, states:  Artificial diseases and the removal of organs practiced in experiments on living animals,  lead to the same result (as spontaneous diseases); however, it is important to point out  that it would be wrong to proceed from services rendered by experimental physiology to  favoring the influence physiology can exert on practical medicine .... When we irritate,  puncture, cut the brain and cerebellum in order to learn the functions of these organs, or  when we cut out a more or less considerable portion, the animal subjected to similar  experiments is certairily as far removed as possible from the physiological state; it is  seriously sick and what is called experimental physiology is obviously nothing other than  a real artificial pathology which is similar to or creates diseases. Of course, physiology  has its leading lights, and the names of Magendie, Orflla, Flourens will always have a  place of honor in its annals; but these very figures offer an authentic and in some way  material proof of everything this science owes to the science of disease [95, L sqq. J. </p><div id="pagenum"><p>101</p></div><p id="page">84 PART TWO  It is to this kind of objection that Claude Bernard replied in the Leqons sur  la chaleur animale:  Certainly an experiment introduces disturbances into the organism, but we must and can  bear this in mind. We must restore the part of the anomalies which is due to them to the  conditions in which we place the animal, and suppress the pain in animals as well as in  man in order to remove causes for error brought about by suffering. But the very anes­ thetics we use have effects on the organism which can give rise to physiological modifica­ tions and new causes for error in our experiments' result [8,57).  A noteworthy passage, which shows how close Bernard is to assuming that it  is possible to discover a determinism of the phenomenon, independent of the  determinism of the operation of knowledge; and how he is honestly obliged  to acknowledge the alteration, in clearly unassignable proportions, to which  knowledge subjects the known phenomenon because of the technical pre­ paration it involves. When we glorify the contemporary theorists of wave  mechanics for their discovery that observation interferes with the observed  phenomenon, it happens that, as in other cases, the idea is a bit older than  they are.  In the course of his research, the physiologist must come to grips with  three kinds of difficulties. First he must be certain that the subject which is  called normal in the experimental situation is identical with the subject of the  same species in a normal, i.e., non-artificial situation. Then he must be certain  of the similarity between the pathological state brought about by experiment  and the spontaneous pathological state. Often the subject in the spontaneous  pathological state belongs to a species other than the subject of the experi­ mental pathological state. For example, without great precautions we cannot  draw any conclusions about the diabetic human from Mering and Minkowski's  dog, or Young's. Finally the physiologist must compare the result of the two  preceding comparisons. No one will question the breadth of the margin of  uncertainty introduced by such comparisons. It is as vain to deny the exist­ ence of this margin as it is childish to question a priori the utility of such  comparisons. In any case one understands the difficulty in realizing the  canonical requirement of "all other things being equal". A convulsive crisis  can be brought on by stimulating the cerebral cortex at the frontal ascendant,  but it still is not epilepsy even if the electroencephalogram, after a succession  of these crises, records superimposable curves. Four pancreases can be grafted  simultaneously onto an animal without the animal experiencing the slightest  hypoglycemic disorder comparable to that brought about by a small adenoma  in the isles of Langerhans [53 his 1 . Sleep can be induced by sleeping pills but  according to, A. Schwartz: </p><div id="pagenum"><p>102</p></div><p id="page">A CRITICAL EXAMINATION OF CONCEPTS 85  It would be wrong to believe that sleep brought on by pharmacological means and  normal sleep necessarily have an exactly similar phenomenology in these conditions. In  reality the two cases are always different as the following examples prove: if, for exam­ ple, the organism is under the influence of a cortical sedative, paraldehyde, the volume  of urine increases, while in the course of normal sleep diuresis is usually reduced. The  center of diuresis, initially liberated by the depressive action of the sedative on the cere­ bral cortex, is thus shielded from the subsequent inhibitory action of the sleep center.  It must be admitted that artificially inducing sleep by interfering with the  nerve centers does not enlighten us as to the mechanism by which the hypno­ tic center is naturally put into operation by the normal factors of sleep [105,  23-28] .  If we may define the normal state of a living being in terms of a normal  relationship of adjustment to environments, we must not forget that the  laboratory itself constitutes a new environment in which life certainly estab­ lishes norms whose extrapolation does not work without risk when removed  from the conditions to which these norms relate. For the animal or for man  the laboratory environment is one possible environment among others. Cer­ tainly, the scientist is right in seeing in his apparatus only the theories which  it materializes, to see in the products used only the reactions they allow; he is  right in postulating the universal validity of these theories and these reactions,  but for the living being apparatus and products are the objects among which  he moves as in an unusual world. It is not possible that the ways of life in the  laboratory fail to retain any specificity in their relationship to the place and  moment of the experiment. </p><div id="pagenum"><p>103</p></div><p id="page">III  NORM AND AVERAGE  It seems that in the concept of average the physiologist finds an objective and  scientifically valid equivalent of the concept of normal or norm. Certainly the  contemporary physiologist no longer shares Claude Bernard's aversion for  every result of analysis or biological experiment expressed as an average, an  aversion which perhaps originated in one of Bichat's texts:  Urine, saliva, bile, etc., taken at random from this or that subject are analyzed and from  their examination animal chemistry is born, whatever it may be. But this is not physio­ logical chemistry; if I may say so, it is the cadaverous anatomy of fluids. Their physio­ logy consists in the knowledge of innumerable variations undergone by the fluids as they  follow the state of their respective organs [12, art. 7, § 1].  Bernard is equally clear. According to him, the use of averages erases the  essentially oscillatory and rhythmic character of the functional biological  phenomenon. For example, if we look for the true number of heart-beats  using the average of measurements taken several times on the same day from  one given individual, "we will clearly have a false number". Hence this rule:  In physiology average descriptions of experiments must never be given because the real  relations of phenomena disappear in this average; when dealing with complex and vari­ able experiments, we must study their different circumstances and then offer the most  perfect experiment as type, which will always represent a true fact [6,286].  Research on average biolOgical values has no meaning as far as the same indivi­ dual is concerned: for example, the analysis of average urine over a 24-hour  period is "the analysis of a urine which does not exist" since urine from the  fasting state differs from that of digestion. This research is equally meaning­ less as far as several individuals are concerned.  The culmination [of this kind of experiment] was conceived by a physiologist who took  urine from the urinal at the train station through which passed people of all nations, and  believed he could thus produce the analysis of average European urine [6,236).  Without wishing to reproach Bernard for confusing research with its carica­ ture and for loading a method with faults when responsibility for it lies with  those who use it, we shall limit ourselves to maintaining that, according to  him, the normal is defined as an ideal type in determined experimental condi- 86 </p><div id="pagenum"><p>104</p></div><p id="page">NORM AND AVERAGE 87  tions rather than as an arithmetical average or statistical frequency.  An analogous and again more recent attitude is that of Vend ryes in his Vie  et probablilite where Bernard's ideas on the constancy and regulations of the  internal environment are systematically reexamined and developed. Defining  physiological regulations as "the complex of functions which withstand  chance" [115,195], or, if one wants functions which cause the living being's  activity to lose its contingent and uncertain character (which would belong to  it were the internal environment deprived of its autonomy vis-a-vis the ex­ ternal environment), Vendryes interprets the variations undergone by phy­ siological constants -glycemia, for example -as divergences from an average,  but an individual average. The terms divergence and average here have a pro­ babilistic meaning. The greater the divergences the more improbable they are.  I do not develop statistics on a certain number of individuals. I consider just one indivi­ dual. The terms average value and divergence under these conditions are applied to the  different values which the same component of the same individual's blood can assume in  successive time periods [115,33).  But we do not think that Vend ryes thereby eliminates the difficulty Bernard  resolved by proposing the most perfect experiment as a type, that is, as a  norm for comparison. In doing this, Bernard openly admitted that the physio­ logist brings to bear the norm of his own choosing in the physiology experi­ ment and that he does not withdraw it. We do not think that Vendryes can  proceed differently. He says that the average value of glycemia is 1 % whereas  [we know that] normally the rate of glycemia is 1 %, but after eating or mus­ cular work, glycemia undergoes positive or negative divergences from this  average value. But assuming one effectively limits oneself to observing one  individual, how does one conclude a priori that the individual chosen as the  subject for the examination of variations of a constant represents the human  type? Either one is a doctor -and this is apparently the case with Vendryes  -and consequently qualified to diagnose diabetes; or one has learned nothing  about physiology in the course of medical studies, and in order to learn the  normal rate of one regulation one will look for the average of a certain num­ ber of results obtained from individuals placed in conditions as similar as  possible. But in the end the problem is to know within what range of oscilla­ tions around a purely theoretical average value individuals will be considered  normal?  A. Mayer [82] and H. Laugier [71] have dealt with this problem with  great clarity and honesty. Mayer enumerates all the elements of contem­ porary physiological biometry: temperature, basal metabolism, blood gases, </p><div id="pagenum"><p>105</p></div><p id="page">88 PART TWO  free heat, characteristics of the blood, rate of circulation, composition of  the blood, reserves, tissues, etc. Now biological values allow a margin of  variation. In order to represent a species we have chosen norms which are in  fact constants determined by averages. The normal living being is the one  who conforms to these norms. But must we consider every divergence ab­ normal?  In reality the model is the product of statistics; most often it is the result of the calcula­ tions of averages. But the real individuals whom we meet diverge from these more or less  and this is precisely in what their individuality consists. It would be very important to  know what the divergences relate to and which divergences are compatible with extended  survival. This should be known for the individuals of each species. Such a study is far  from being done [82,4.54-14].  Laugier shows the difficulty of such a study dealing with man. He does it  first by expounding Quetelet's theory of the average man, to which we shall  return. The establishment of one of Quetelet's curves does not solve the prob­ lem of the normal for a given characteristic, for example, height. Guiding  hypotheses and practical conventions are needed, allowing one to decide what  value for heights, either toward the tall or the short, constitutes the transition  from normal to abnormal. The same problem presents itself if we substitute a  set of arithmetical averages with a statistical plan from which any individual  diverges more or less, because statistics offer no means for deciding whether a  divergence is normal or abnormal. Using a convention that reason itself seems  to suggest, could one perhaps consider as normal the individual whose bio­ metrical profile allows one to predict that, barring an accident, he will have a  life span appropriate to his species? But the same questions reappear.  In individuals who apparently die of senescence, we will find a very wide spread of life  spans. Shall we take as the species's life span the average of these spans or the maximum  spans reached by some rare individuals, or some other value? [71,4.56-4].  Moreover this normality would not exclude other abnormalities: a certain  congenital deformity can be compatible with a very long life. Strictly speak­ ing, if the average state of the characteristic studied in the observed group  can furnish a substitute for objectivity in the determination of a partial nor­ mality, the nature of the section about the average remains arbitrary; in any  case all objectivity vanishes in the determination of a universal normality.  Given the inadequacy of biometrical numerical data and the uncertainty as to where we  are with regard to the validity of the principles to be used in establishing the dividing line  between normal and abnormal, the scientific definition of normality, at the moment,  seems beyond reach [ibid.]. </p><div id="pagenum"><p>106</p></div><p id="page">NORM AND AVERAGE 89  It is still more modest or, on the other hand, more ambitious to assert the  logical independence of the concepts of norm and average and consequently  the definitive impossibility of producing the full equivalent of the anatomical  or physiological normal in the form of an objectively calculated average?  Starting with Quetelet's ideas and Halbwachs's very rigorous examinations of  them, we intend to summarize the problem of the meaning and scope of bio­ metric research in physiology. On the whole the physiologist who reviews its  basic concepts is well aware that for him norm and average are two insepara­ ble concepts. But average seems to him to be directly capable of objective  definition and so he tries to join norm to it. We have just seen that this  attempt at reduction runs into difficulties which are now, and undoubtedly  always will be, insurmountable. Would it not be appropriate to turn the prob­ lem around and to ask whether the link between the two concepts couldn't  be explained in terms of the subordination of average to norm? We know that  biometry as applied to anatomy was first established by Galton's works, which  generalized Quetelet's anthropometric procedures. In systematically studying  the variations in human height, Quetelet had established and represented  graphically the existence of a polygon of frequency showing an apex corre­ sponding to the maximum ordinate, and a symmetry in terms of this ordinate  for a characteristic measured in individuals of a homogeneous population. We  know that the limit of a polygon is a curve and it was Quetelet himself who  showed that the polygon of frequency tends toward a so-called 'bell-shaped'  curve which is the binomial or Gaussian error curve. By means of this rela­ tionship Quetelet expressly wanted to demonstrate that he recognized a given  characteristic's individual variation (fluctuation) only in terms of that of an  accident verifying the laws of chance, that is, the laws which express the  influence of an unassignable multiplicity of non-systematically oriented  causes whose effects consequently tend to cancel out one another through  progressive compensations. Now, to Quetelet this possible interpretation of  biological fluctuations in terms of the calculation of probabilities seemed of  the greatest metaphysical importance. According to him it meant there exists  "a type or module" for the human race "whose different proportions could be  easily determined" [96, 15]. If this were not the case, if men differed from  one another -with respect to height, for example -not because of the effect  of accidental causes but because of the absence of a type with which they  could be compared, no definite relationship could be established among all  the individual measurements. On the other hand, if there is a type in terms of  -which divergences are purely accidental, a measured characteristic's numerical </p><div id="pagenum"><p>107</p></div><p id="page">90 PART TWO  values, taken from many, many individuals, must be distributed according to  a mathematical law and this is indeed what happens. In other respects, the  greater the number of measurements carried out, the more the accidental  disturbing causes will compensate and cancel out one another and the more  clearly the general type will appear. But above all, from any large number of  men whose height varies between determined limits, those who come closest  to the average height are the most numerous, those who diverge from it the  most are the least numerous. Quetelet called this human type -from which  the greater the divergence, the rarer it is -the average man. When Quetelet  is cited as the father of biometry, it is generally left unsaid that for him the  average man is by no means an 'impossible man' [96, 22] . In a given region  the proof of the average man's existence is found in the way the figures  obtained for each dimension measured (height, head, arms, etc.) group them­ selves around the average by obeying the law of accidental causes. The average  height in a given group is such that the largest of the subgroups formed of  men of the same height is the set of men whose height comes closest to the  average. This makes the typical average completely different from the arith­ metical average. When we measure the height of several houses we may get  an average height but such that no house can be found whose own height  approaches the average. In short, the existence of an average is, according to  Quetelet, the indisputable sign of the existence of a regularity, interpreted in  an expressly ontological sense:  For me the principal idea is to cause the truth to prevail and to show how much man,  without his knowledge, is subject to divine laws and with what regularity he realizes  them. Moreover, this regularity is not peculiar to man: it is one of the great laws of  nature belonging to animals as well as plants, and it will be surprising perhaps that it  was not recognized sooner [96,21].  The interest of Quetelet's conception lies in the fact that in his notion of true  average he identifies the ideas of statistical frequency and norm, for an aver­ age which determines that the greatest divergences are the most rare is really  a norm; This is not the place to discuss the metaphysical foundation of  Quetelet's theSis, but simply to argue that he distinguishes two kinds of aver­ ages: the arithmetical average or median and the true average; and that far  from presenting the average as the empirical foundation of the norm with  regard to human physical characteristics, he explicitly presents an ontolOgical  regularity which expresses itself in the average. If it should seem questionable  to resort to God's will in order to understand the module for human height,  this does not mean that no norm shows through in that average. And this </p><div id="pagenum"><p>108</p></div><p id="page">NORM AND AVERAGE 91  seems to us to be what can be concluded from the critical examination to  which Halbwachs subjected Quetelet's ideas [53).  According to Halbwachs, Quetelet is mistaken in considering the distribu­ tion of human heights around an average as a phenomenon to which the laws  of chance can be applied. The first condition of this application is that phe­ nomena, taken as combinations of elements of an unassignable number, are  realizations which are completely independent of one another, so that no one  of them exerts any influence on the one that follows. Now, constant organic  effects cannot be assimilated with phenomena governed by the laws of chance.  To do so is to admit that physical facts resulting from the environment and  physiological facts related to the process of growth are arranged in such a way  that each realization is independent of the others at an earlier, and at the same,  time. This is untenable from the human point of view, where social norms  interfere with biological laws so that the human individual is the product of a  union subject to all kinds of customary and matrimonial legislative prescrip­ tions. In short, heredity and tradition, habit and custom, are as much forms of  dependence and interindividual connection as they are obstacles to an ade­ quate utilization of the calculation of probabilities. Height, the characteristic  studied by Quetelet, would be a purely biological fact only if it were studied  in a set of individuals constituting a pure line, either animal or plant. In this  case the fluctuations on both sides of the specific module would derive solely  from the action of the environment. But in the human species height is a  phenomenon inseparably biological and social. Even if height is a function of  the environment, the product of human activity must be seen, in a sense, in  the geographical environment. Man is a geographical agent and geography is  thoroughly penetrated by history in the form of collective technolOgies. For  example, statistical observation has made it possible to establish the influence  of the draining of the Sologne marshes on the height of the inhabitants [89).  Sorre acknowledges that the average height of some human groups is probably  raised under the influence of improved diet [109, 286). But we believe that if  Quetelet made a mistake in attributing a value of a divine norm to the average  of a human anatomical characteristic, this lies perhaps only in specifying the  norm, not in interpreting the average as a sign of a norm. If it is true that the  human body is in one sense a product of social activity, it is not absurd to  assume that the constancy of certain traits, revealed by an average, depends  on the conscious or unconscious fidelity to certain norms of life. Consequent­ ly, in the human species, statistical frequency expresses not only vital but also  social normativity. A human trait would not be normal because frequent but  frequent because normal, that is, normative in one given kind of life, taking </p><div id="pagenum"><p>109</p></div><p id="page">92 PART TWO  these words kind of life in the ,sense given them by the geographers of the  school of Vidal de la Blache [1845-1918; founder of French 'human geo­ graphy'] .  This will appear even more obvious if, instead of considering an anatomical  characteristic, we concentrate on a physiological one like longevity. Flourens,  following Buffon, looked for a way to determine scientifically man's natural  or normal life span, using and correcting Buffon's works. Flourens linked the  life span to the specific duration of growth, whose term he defined in terms  of the union of bones at their epiphyses. 24 "Man grows for twenty years and  lives for five times twenty, that is, 100 years". That this normal human life  span is neither the frequent nor the average duration is clearly specified by  Flourens:  Every day we see men who live 90 and 100 years. I am well aware that the number of  those who reach that point is small when compared to the number of those who do not  reach it, but in fact such ages are reached And because they are sometimes reached, it  is very possible to conclude that they would be reached more often, that they would be  reached often if accidental and extrinsic circumstances, if disturbing causes did not get  in the way. Most men die from disease; very few die, strictly speaking, of old age [39,  80-81],  Metchnikoff also thinks that man can normally become a centenarian and  that every old man who dies before 100 years of age is in theory a sick man.  The variations in man's average life span through the years (39 in 1865 and  52 in 1920 in France for males) are quite instructive. In order to assign a  normal life to man, Buffon and Flourens considered him from the same  biological perspective that they used for the rabbit or camel. But when we  speak of an avera~e life, in order to show it growing gradually, we link it to  the action that man, taken collectively, exercises on himself. It is in this sense  that Halbwachs deals with death as a social phenomenon, believing that the  age at which death occurs results largely from working and hygienic condi­ tions, attention paid to fatigue and diseases, in short, from social as much as  physiological conditions. Everything happens as if a society had "the mortal­ ity that suits it", the number of the dead and their distribution into different  age groups expressing the importance which the society does or does not give  to the protraction of life [53,94-97]. In short, the techniques of collective  hygiene which tend to prolong human life, or the habits of negligence which  result in shortening it, depending on the value attached to life in a given  society, are in the end a value judgment expressed in the abstract 'number  which is the average human life span. The average life span is not the biologi­ cally normal, but in a sense the socially normative, life span. Once more the </p><div id="pagenum"><p>110</p></div><p id="page">NORM AND AVERAGE 93  norm is not deduced from, but rather expressed in the average. This would be  clearer still if, instead of considering the average life span in a national society  taken as a whole, we broke this society down into classes, occupations, etc.  We would see, of course, that the life span depends on what Halbwachs calls  elsewhere the levels of life.  Undoubtedly it will be objected that such a conception is valid for super­ ficial human characteristics for which there does exist, for the most part, a  margin of tolerance where social diversities are in evidence, but that it certain­ ly is not -suitable for either fundamental human characteristics, which are  essentially rigid such as glycemia, calcemia, or blood pH, or, generally speak­ ing, for strictly specific characteristics in animals to which no collective tech­ nique offers any relative plasticity. Of course, we don't intend to maintain  that anatomic-physiological averages express social norms and values in ani­ mals, but we do ask whether they wouldn't express vital norms and values. In  the previous section we saw the example mentioned by G. Teissier of that  butterfly species which oscillates between two varieties, tending to blend in  with one or the other, depending on which of the two combinations that are  compensated with contrasting characteristics the environment tolerates. We  may well ask whether there wouldn't be a kind of general rule for the inven­ tion of living forms. Consequently a very different meaning could be given to  the existence of an average of the most frequent characteristics than that  attributed to it by Quetelet. It would not express a specific stable equilibrium  but rather the unstable equilibrium of nearly equal norms and forms of life  temporarily brought together. Instead of conSidering a specific type as being  really stable because it presents characteristics devoid of any incompatibility,  it could be considered as being apparently stable because it has temporarily  succeeded in reconciling opposing demands by means of a set of compensa­ tions. A normal specific form would be the product of a normalization be­ tween functions and organs whose synthetic harmony is obtained in defined  conditions and is not given. This is almost what Halbwachs suggested in 1912  in his criticism of Quetelet:  Why should we conceive of the species as a type from which individuals diverge only by  chance? Why wouldn't its unity be the result of a duality of conformation, a conflict of  two or a very small number of general organic tendencies which, all things considered,  would balance each other out? What could be more natural than the expression of this  divergence of its members' activities in terms of a regular series of divergences from the  average in two different directions .... If these divergences were more numerous in one  direction, this would indicate that the species tends to evolve in that direction under the  influence of one or more constant causes [53,61). </p><div id="pagenum"><p>111</p></div><p id="page">94 PART TWO  As far as man and his permanent physiological characteristics are concerned,  only a comparative human physiology and pathology -in the sense that  there exists a comparative literature -of the various ethnic, ethical or reli­ gious, and technical groups and subgroups, which would take into account  life's intricacy and its kinds and social levels, could furnish a precise answer  to our hypotheses. It seems that this comparative human physiology, done  from a systematic point of view, still remains to be written by a physiologist.  Of course, there are compact compilations of biometrical data of anatomy  and physiology concerning animal species as well as the human species sepa­ rated into ethnic gorups, for example the Tabulae biologicae [Junk, The  Hague], but these are lists without any attempt at an interpretation of the  results of the comparisons. By comparative human physiology we mean that  kind of research best represented by the works of Eijkmann, Benedict, and  Ozorio de Almeida on basal metabolism and its relations with climate and  race [Bibliography in 61, 299]. But it happens that this gap has just been  filled in part by the recent works of the French geographers, Sorre, whose  Les fondements biologiques de la geographie humaine ['The Biological Foun­ dations of Human Geography'] was drawn to our attention when the drafting  of the essay was completed. We shall say something about this later, following  a development which we want to leave in its primitive state, not so much out  of concern for originality than as evidence of a convergence. Methodological­ ly, the convergence by far prevails over the originality.  First of all, it will be agreed that in determining physiological constants by  constructing averages obtained experimentally only within the laboratory  framework, one would run the risk of presenting normal man as a mediocre  man, far below the phYSiological possibilities of which men, acting directly  and concretely on themselves or the environment, are obviously capable, even  to the least scientifically informed observers. One may answer by pointing  out that the frontiers of the laboratory have very much expanded since  Claude Bernard; that physiology extends its jurisdiction over vocational  guidance and selection centers and physical education institutes; in short, that  the physiologist looks to the concrete man, not the laboratory subject in a  very artificial situation; and that he himself determines the tolerated margins  of variations with biometrical values. When A. Mayer writes:  The very aim of the establishment of sports records is to measure the maximum activity  of man's musculature [82,4.54-14),  we think of Thibaudet's witty remark: </p><div id="pagenum"><p>112</p></div><p id="page">NORM AND AVERAGE 95  It is the record figures, not physiology, that answers the question: how many meters  can a man jump? [Le bergsonisme (Paris, Editions de la nouvelle revue fran(faise, 1923)  1,203) .  In short, physiology would be only one sure and precise method for recording  and standardizing the functional freedoms acquired or rather progressively  mastered by man. If we can speak of normal man as determined by the phy­ siologist, it is because normative men exist for whom it is normal to break  norms and establish new ones.  As an expression of human biological normativity, not only do individual  variations on the so-called civilized white man's common physiological  'themes' seem interesting, but even more so are the variations of the themes  themselves from group to group, depending on the types and levels of life, as  related to life's ethical or religious attitudes, in short, the collective norms of  life. In connection with this, Charles Laubry and Therese Brosse, thanks to  the most modern recording techniques, have studied the physiological effects  of the religious discipline which allows Hindu yogis almost complete mastery  over the functions of vegetative existence. This mastery is such that it suc­ ceeds in regulating the peristaltic and antiperistaltic movements and in using  the anal and vesical sphincters in every possible way, thus abolishing the phy­ siological distinction between smooth and striated muscle systems. This mas­ tery abolishes even the relative autonomy of the vegetative life. The simul­ taneous recording of pulse, respiration, electrocardiogram, and the measure­ ment of basal metabolism have allowed one to establish that mental concen­ tration, as it tends toward the fusion of the individual with the universal  object, produces the following effects: accelerated heart rhythm, modifica­ tion of the pulse's rhythm and pressure, and modification of the electrocar­ diogram: low generalized voltage, disappearance of waves, infmitesimal  fibrillation on the isoelectric line, reduced basal metabolism [70,1604]. The  key to the yogi's action on physiological functions, which seem least subject  to the will, lies in breathing; it is breathing which is required to act on the  other functions; by reducing it the body is placed "in the state of slowed  existence comparable to that of hibernating animals" [ibid.]. To obtain a  change in pulse rhythm from 50 to 150, an apnea [absence of respiration] of  15 minutes, an almost total suppression of cardiac contraction, certainly  amounts to breaking physiological norms. Unless one chooses to consider  such results pathological. But this is clearly impossible:  If yogis are ignorant of the structure of their organs, they are indisputable masters of  their functions. They enjoy a magnificent state of health and yet they have inflicted on </p><div id="pagenum"><p>113</p></div><p id="page">96 PART TWO  themselves years of exercises which they couldn't have stood if they hadn't respected  the laws of physiological activity [ibid.].  Laubry and Brosse conclude from such facts that we are in the presence of a  human physiology which is very different from simple animal physiology:  "The will seems to act as a pharmacodynamic test and for our superior facul­ ties we glimpse an infinite power of regulation and order" [ibid.]. Whence  these remarks of Brosse on the problem of the pathological:  The problem of functional pathology, considered from the perspective of conscious  activity related to the psychophysiological levels it uses, seems intimately connected  with that of education. As the consequence of a sensory, active, emotional education,  badly done or not done, it urgently calls for a reeducation. More and more the idea of  health or normality ceases to appear as that of conformity to an outer ideal (athlete in  body, bachelier [lycee graduate] in mind). It takes its place in the relation between  the conscious I and its psychophysiological organisms; it is relativist and individualist  [17,49].  On these problems of physiology and comparative pathology we are forced  to content ourselves with few documents, but, although their authors have  followed dissimilar purposes, they lead one, surprisingly, to the same con­ clusions. Porak, who sought knowledge about the beginning of diseases in the  study of functional rhythms and their disturbances, has demonstrated the  relationship between kinds of existence and the curves of diuresis and tem­ perature (slow rhythms), pulse and respiration (fast rhythms). Young Chinese  between 18 and 25 have an average urinary discharge of 0.5 cm3 per minute  with oscillations from 0.2 to 0.7 while for Europeans this discharge is 1 cm3  with oscillations from 0.8 to 1.5. Porak interprets this physiological fact in  terms of the combined influences of geography and history in Chinese civili­ zation. According to him, two out of this complex of influences are funda­ mental: the nature of the diet (tea, rice, young vegetables) and the nutritive  rhythms determined by ancestral experience; -the mode of activity which  more so in China than in the West respects the periodic development of  neuro-muscular activity. Western sedentary habits have a harmful effect on  the rhythm of liquids. This disturbance does not exist in China, where the  taste for walking 'in the passionate desire to lose oneself in nature" has been  preserved [94,4-6] .  The study of respiratory rhythm (rapid rhythm) shows up variations in the  need for activity related to development and to ankylosis. This need is itself  related to natural or social phenomena which punctuate human work. Since  the invention of agriculture, the solar day has framed the activity of most </p><div id="pagenum"><p>114</p></div><p id="page">NORM AND AVERAGE 97  men. Urban civilization and the demands of a modern economy have dis­ turbed the great physiological cycles of activity of which only traces remain.  Onto these fundamental cycles are grafted secondary cycles. While changes in  position determine secondary cycles in the variations of the pulse, it is the  psychic influences which predominate in breathing. Breathing speeds up on  awakening, as soon as the eyes open to the light:  To open the eyes means that the attitude of the state of wakefulness is already being  assumed; it means that the functional rhythms are already being oriented toward the  deployment ofneurom'otor activity, and the supple respiratory function is ready to meet  the outside world: it reacts immediately to the opening of the eyelids [94,62).  Because of the hematosis it guarantees, the respiratory function is so impor­ tant for the explosive or sustained deployment of muscular energy that a very  subtle regulation must determine instantaneously considerable variations in  the volume of inhaled air. Respiratory intensity thus depends on the quality  of our attacks or our reactions in our conflict with the environment. Respira­ tory rhythm is a function of our awareness of our situation in the world.  One would expect that Porak's observations would lead him to offer in­ formation about therapeutics and hygiene. And this is in fact what happens.  Since physiological norms define less human nature than human habits as they  relate to the kinds, levels, and rhythms of life, every dietary rule must take  these habits into account. Here is a good example of therapeutic relativism:  Chinese women nurse their children during their first two years of life. After being  weaned, the children will never drink milk again. Cow's milk is considered an unsuitable  liquid, good only for pigs. I have often tried cow's milk with patients suffering from  nephritis. Urinary ankylosis was produced immediately. By putting the patient on a diet  of tea and rice, a good urinary crisis reestablished the eurhythmia [94,99) .  As for the causes of functional diseases, if considered at their onset, they are  almost all disturbances of rhythms, arhythmias stemming from fatigue or  overwork, that is, from any exercise exceeding the proper adjustment of the  individual's needs to the environment [94,86].  It is impossible to maintain a type within his margin of functional availability. I believe  the best definition of man would be an insatiable being, i.e., one who always exceeds  his needs [94,89).  Here is a good defmition of health that prepares us to understand its relation­ ship to disease.  When Marcel Labbe studied the etiology of nutritional diseases principally  with regard to diabetes, he came to analogous conclusions. </p><div id="pagenum"><p>115</p></div><p id="page">98 PART TWO  Nutritional diseases are not organic but functional diseases .... Defects in diet play an  important role in the origin of nutritional disturbances .... Obesity is the most frequent  and the simplest of these diseases created by the soft upbringing [education morbidel  provided by parents .... Most nutritional diseases are inevitable .... I am speaking  above all of bad habits of life and diet which individuals must avoid and which parents  already afflicted with nutritional disturbances must avoid passing on to their children  [65,10.501].  We can only conclude that to consider the education of functions as a thera­ peutic measure, as Laubry and Brosse, Porak and Marcel Labbe do, is to admit  that functional constants are habitual norms. What habit has made, habit  unmakes and remakes. If diseases can be defined as defects in terms other  than metaphorical, then physiological constants must be defmable, other than  metaphorically, as virtues in the old sense of the word, which blends virtue,  power, and function.  It must be said that Sorre's research on the relationship between man's  physiological and pathological characteristics and climates, diets, and biologi­ cal environment, have an aim completely different from the works we have  just cited. But what is noteworthy is that all these points of view are justified  and their insights confirmed in Sorre's work. Men's adaptation to altitude and  its hereditary physiological action [109,51] ; the problems of the effects of  light [109, 54] ; thermic tolerance [109,58] ; acclimatization [109, 94] ; diet  at the expense of a living environment created by man [109,120] ; geographi­ cal distribution and the plastic action of diets [109,245,275]; and the area  of the extension of complex pathogens (sleeping sickness, malaria, plague,  etc.) [109,291] : all these questions are treated with a great deal of precision,  breadth, and constant common sense. Certainly what interests Sorre above all  is man's ecology, the explanation of the problems of human settlement. But  in the end, as all these problems lead to problems of adaptation, we see how a  geographer's work is of great interest for a methodological essay on biological  norms. Sorre sees very clearly the importance of the cosmopolitanism of the  human species for a theory of the relative instability of physiological con­ stants: the importance of false adaptive eqUilibrium states to explain diseases  or mutations; the relation of anatomical and physiological constants to collec­ tive diets, which he very judiciously qualifies as norms [109,249]; the irre­ ducibility, to purely utilitarian reasons, of techniques for creating a really  human ambience; the importance, in terms of the orientation of activity, of  the indirect action of the human psyche on characteristics long considered  natural such as height, weight, collective diatheses. By way of conclusion,  Sorre is interested in showing that man, taken collectively, is searching for his </p><div id="pagenum"><p>116</p></div><p id="page">NORM AND AVERAGE 99  'functional optima', that is, for values of each of the elements in his sur­ roundings for which a particular function is best carried out. Physiological  constants are not constants in the absolute sense of the term. For each func­ tion and set of functions there is a margin where the group or species capacity  for adaptation comes into play. The optimal conditions thus determine a  zone for human settlement where the uniformity of human characteristics  expresses not only the inertia of a determinism but also the stability of a  result maintained by an unconscious but real collective effort [109,415-16].  It goes without saying that we are pleased to see a geographer bringing the  solidity of his results of analysis to bear in supporting our suggested inter­ pretation of biological constants. Constants are presented with an average  frequency and value in a given group which gives them the value of normal  and this normal is truly the expression of a normativity. The physiological  constant is the expression of a physiological optimum in given conditions  among which we must bear in mind those which the living being in general,  and homo faber in particular, give themselves.  Because of these conclusions we would differ somewhat from Pales and  Monglond in interpreting their very interesting data on the rate of glycemia  in African blacks [92 bis]. Out of 84 Brazzaville natives, 66% showed hy­ poglycemia; of these, 39% went from 0.90 g to 0.75 g and 27% were below  0.75 g. According to these authors the black must be generally considered as  hypoglycemic. In any case the black withstands hypoglycemias which would  be considered grave if not mortal in a European, without apparent distur­ bance and especially without either convulsions or coma. The causes of this  hypoglycemia would have to be sought in chronic under-nourishment, chronic  and polymorphous intestinal parasitism, and malaria.  These states are on the border between physiology and pathology. From the European  point of view they are pathological; from the indigenous point of view they are so close­ ly linked to the black's habitual state that were it not for the comparative terms of the  white, it could almost be considered physiological [92, bis, 767].  We definitely think that if the European can serve as a norm, it is only to the  extent that his kind of life will be able to pass as normative. To Lefrou as well  as to Pales and Monglond the black's indolence appears related to his hypogly·  cemia [76, bis, 278; 92 bis, 767]. These last authors say that the black leads a  life in accordance with his means. But could it not just as well be said that the  black has physiological means in accordance with the life he leads?  The relativity of certain aspects of anatomic and physiological norms and </p><div id="pagenum"><p>117</p></div><p id="page">100 PART TWO  consequently of certain pathological disturbances as they relate to ways of  life and knowledge of the world, is apparent not only in the comparison of  ethnic and cultural groups which can be observed now, but also in the com·  parison of these present·day groups and earlier groups which have disappeared.  Of course, paleopathology has even fewer documents at its disposal than  paleontology or paleography, nevertheless the prudent conclusions which can  be drawn from it deserve to be shown.  Pales, who has made a good synthesis of works of this kind in France, bor·  rowed a definition of the paleopathological document from Roy C. Moodie,  namely, every deviation from the healthy state of the body which has left  a visible trace on the fossilized skeleton [92, 16; in Pales 92 see a list of  Moodie's works, and for a popularization see H. de Varigny, La mort et la  biologie (Paris, Alcan, 1926)]. If the sharpened flints and art of Stone Age  men tell the story of their struggles, their works, and their thought, their  bones call to mind the history of their pains [92,307]. Paleopathology allows  one to conceive of the pathological fact in human history as a fact of sym·  biosis, in the case of infectious diseases (and this concerns not only man but  the living in general), and as a fact of the cultural level or kind of life, in the  case of nutritional diseases. The diseases suffered by prehistoric men turned  up in very different proportions from those which diseases now offer for  consideration. Vallois points out that in French prehistory alone eleven cases  of tuberculosis turn up out of several thousand skeletons studied [113,672].  If the absence of rickets, a disease caused by vitamin D deficiency, is normal  in an age where raw or barely cooked foods were consumed [113,672], the  appearance of tooth decay, unknown to the first men, signifies civilization in  terms of the consumption of starches and cooking food which brings in its  wake the destruction of vitamins necessary for the assimilation of calcium  [113, 677]. Likewise, osteoarthritis was much more frequent in the Stone  Age and subsequent epochs than it is now, and this must probably be attri·  buted to an inadequate diet and a cold, humid climate, since its diminution in  our day means better diet and a more hygienic way of life [113,672].  We can easily imagine the difficulty of a study which lacks all the diseases  whose plastic or deforming effects failed to leave traces on the skeletons of  fossil men or those dug up in the course of archeological excavations. We can  imagine the prudence necessary in drawing conclusions from this study. But  to the extent that we can speak of a prehistoric pathology, we should also be  able to speak of a prehistoriC physiology just as we speak, without too much  inaccuracy, of a prehistoric anatomy. Here again the relationship between  the biological norms of life and the human environment seems to be both </p><div id="pagenum"><p>118</p></div><p id="page">NORM AND AVERAGE 101  cause and effect of men's structure and behavior. Pales points out, with  common sense, that if Bou1e cou1d determine that the Man of La Chapelle­ aux-Saints [a complete fossil skeleton found in 1908 in a cave in Comlze,  France] typifies the classical anatomy of the Neanderthal race, we [by con­ trast] could see in him without too much complacency, the most perfect  type of pathological fossil man, suffering from alveolar pyorrhea, bilateral  coxal-femoral osteoarthritis, cervical and lumbar spondylosis, etc. Yes, if we  were to ignore the differences of cosmic milieu, technical equipment, and  way of life which make the abnormal of today the normal of yesterday.  If it seems difficult to dispute the quality of the observations used above, one  might want to question the conclusions to which they lead concerning the  physiological significance of functional constants interpreted as habitual  norms of life. By way of response, it should be pointed out that these norms  are not the product of individual habits which a certain individual could take  or leave as he pleased. If we admit man's functional plasticity, linked in him  to vital normativity, we are not dealing with either a total and instantaneous  malleability or a purely individual one. To propose, with all suitable reserva­ tions, that man has physiological characteristics related to his activity, does  not mean allowing every individual to believe that he will be able to change  his glycemia or basal metabolism by the Coue method [of autosuggestion] or  even by emigrating. What the species has worked out over the course of  millenia does not change in a matter of days. Voelker has shown that basal  metabolism does not change as one goes from Hamburg to Iceland. Benedict  makes the same point concerning the moving of North Americans to subtro­ pical regions. But Benedict has ascertained that the metabolism of Chinese  permanently residing in the United States is lower than the American norm.  Generally speaking, Benedict has established that [aboriginal] Australians  (Kokatas) have a lower metabolism than whites of the same age, weight, and  height living in the United States, that inversely Indians (Mayas) have a higher  metabolism with a slowed pulse and permanently lowered arterial pressure.  We can conclude with Kayser and Dontcheff:  It seems a proven fact that with man the climatic factor has no direct effect on meta­ bolism; it is only in a very progressive manner that climate, by modifying the mode of  life and allowing the consolidation of special races, has any lasting action on basal  metabolism [62,286].  In short, to consider the average values of human physiological constants  as the expression of vital collective norms would only amount to saying that </p><div id="pagenum"><p>119</p></div><p id="page">102 PART TWO  the human race, in inventing kinds of life, invents physiological behaviors  at the same time. But are the kinds of life not imposed? The works of the  Franch school of human geography [Sorre and Vidal de la Blache] have  shown that there is no geographical destiny. Environments offer man only  potentialities for technical utilization and collective activity. Choice decides.  Let us be clear that it is not a question of an explicit and conscious choice.  But from the moment several collective norms of life are possible in a given  milieu, the one adopted, whose antiquity makes it seem natural, is, in the  final analysis, the one chosen.  In certain cases, however, it is possible to show the influence of an explicit  choice on the direction of some physiological behavior. This is the lesson  which emerges from observations and experiments related to temperature  oscillations in the homeothermic animal, to circadian rhythm.  The works of Kayser and his collaborators on the pigeon's circadian  rhythm established that the day and night variations in the central tempera­ ture of the homeothermic animal are a phenomenon of vegetative life subor­ dinated to relational functions. The nocturnal reduction of exchanges is the  effect of the suppression of light and sound stimulants. The circadian rhythm  disappears in a pigeon made blind experimentally and isolated from his nor­ mal brethren. The reversal of the order in the light-dark succession reverses  the rhythm after a few days. The circadian rhythm is determined by a condi­ tioned reflex maintained by the natural alteration of day and night. As for  the mechanism, it does not consist in a nocturnal hypoexcitability of the  thermoregulatory centers but in the supplementary production by day of an  amount of heat which is added to the calorification, evenly regulated day and  night by the thermoregulatory center. This heat depends on stimulation com­ ing from the environment as well as on the temperature: it increases with  cold. When all heat produced by muscular activity is set aside, the rise which  gives circadian temperature its rhythmic aspect must be related only to the  increase in posture tonus by day. The homeothermic animal's circadian tem­ perature rhythm is the expression of a variation in attitude of the entire  organism with respect to the environment. Even when at rest the animal's  energy, if it is stimulated by the environment, is not entirely at its disposal,  one part being mobilized in tonic attitudes of vigilance and readiness. The  state of wakefulness is a behavior which, even without alarms, does not work  without costs [60;61 ;62;63].  These conclusions shed a great deal of light on some observations and  experiments concerning man, results which have often seemed contradictory.  Mosso, on the one hand and Benedict on the other, were unable to show that </p><div id="pagenum"><p>120</p></div><p id="page">NORM AND AVERAGE 103  the normal temperature curve depends on environmental conditions. But in  1907 Toulouse and Pieron stated that the inversion of the conditions of life  (nocturnal activity and diurnal rest) brought about the complete inversion of  the circadian temperature rhythm in man. How do we explain this contradic­ tion? Benedict had observed subjects who were unaccustomed to nocturnal  life and who at rest hours during the day led the normal life of their environ­ ment. According to Kayser, as long as experimental conditions do not equal  those of a complete inversion of the mode of life, it is not possible to demon­ strate a dependence between the rhythm and the environment. The following  facts confirm this interpretation. In the suckling, circadian rhythm appears  progressively, parallel to the infant's psychic development. At the age of eight  days the divergence in temperature is 0.09°, at five months, 0.37°, between  two and five years, 0.95°. Certain authors, Osborne and Voelker, have studied  circadian rhythm in the course of long trips and they state that this rhythm  follows the local time exactly [61, 304-306]. Lindhard points out that  during a Danish expedition to Greenland in 1906-1908, circadian rhythm  followed local time and that as far north as 76°46' an entire crew, as well as  the temperature curve, succeeded in shifting to the twelve-hour 'day'. Com­ plete reversal could not be obtained because of the persistence of normal  activity.25  Here then is an example of a constant related to the conditions of activity,  to a collective and even individual kind of life, whose relativity expresses  norms of human behavior in terms of a reflex conditioned to variable dis­ engagement. Human will and human technology can turn night into day not  only in the environment where human activity unfolds, but also in the organ­ ism itself whose activity confronts the environment. We do not know to what  extent other physiological constants, when analyzed, could appear in the  same way as the effect of a supple adaptation of human behavior. What mat­ ters to us is less to furnish a provisional solution than to show that a problem  deserves to be posed. In any case, in this example we think we are using the  term 'behavior' correctly. From the moment the conditioned reflex sets the  cerebral cortex's activity into operation, the term 'reflex' must not be taken  in its strict sense. We are dealing with a global, not a segmented, functional  phenomenon.  By way of summary, we think that the concepts of norm and average must be  considered as two different concepts: it seems vain to try to reduce them to  one by wiping out the originality of the first. It seems to us that physiology  has better to do than to search for an objective definition of the normal, and </p><div id="pagenum"><p>121</p></div><p id="page">104 PART TWO  that is to recognize the original normative character of life. The true role of  physiology, of sufficient importance and difficulty, would then be to deter­ mine exactly the content of the norms to which life has succeeded in fixing  itself without prejudicing the possibility or impossibility of eventually cor­ recting these norms. Bichat said that animals inhabit the world while plants  belong only to their place of origin. This idea is even more true of men than  of animals. Man has succeeded in living in all climates; he is the only animal  -with the possible exception of spiders -whose area of expansion equals  the area of the earth. But above all he is the animal who, through technology,  succeeds in varying even the ambience of his activity on the spot, thereby  showing himself now as the only species capable of variation [114]. Is it  absurd to assume that in the long run man's natural organs can express the  influence of the artificial organs through which he has multiplied and still  multiplies the power of the first? We are aware that the heredity of acquired  characteristics seems to most biologists to be a problem which has been  resolved in the negative. We take the liberty of asking ourselves whether the  theory of the environment's action on the living being were not on the verge  of recovering from long discredit.26* True, it could be objected that in this  case biolOgical constants would express the effect of external conditions of  existence on the living being and that our suppositions concerning the norma­ tive value of [natural] constants would be deprived of meaning. They would  certainly be so if variable biological characteristics expressed change of en­ vironment, as variations in acceleration due to weight are related to latitude.  But we repeat that biological functions are unintellible as observation reveals  them to us, if they express only states of a material which is passive before  changes in the environment. In fact the environment of the living being is also  the work of the living being who chooses to shield himself from or submit  himself to certain influences. We can say of the universe of every living thing  what Reininger says of the universe of man: "Unser Weltbild ist immer  zugleich ein Wertbild'?7 our image of the world is always a display of values  as well. </p><div id="pagenum"><p>122</p></div><p id="page">IV  DISEASE, CURE, HEALTH  In distinguishing anomaly from the pathological state, biological variety from  negative vital value, we have, on the whole, delegated the responsibility for  perceiving the onset of disease to the living being himself, considered in his  dynamic polarity. That is to say, in dealing with biological norms, one must  always refer to the individual because this individual, as Goldstein says, can  find himself "equal to the tasks resulting from the environment suited to  him" [46, 265], but in organic conditions which, in any other individual,  would be inadequate for these tasks. Just like Laugier, Goldstein asserts that  a statistically obtained average does not allow us to decide whether the indivi­ dual before us is normal or not. We cannot start from it in order to discharge  our medical duty toward the individual. When it comes to a supra-individual  norm, it is impossible to determine the 'sick being' (Kranksein) as to content.  But this is perfectly possible for an individual norm [46,265, 272] .  In the same way, Sigerist insists on the individual relativity of the biologi­ cal norm. If we are to believe tradition, Napoleon had a pulse of 40 even  when he was in good health! If, with 40 contractions a minute, an organism is  up to the demands imposed on him, then he is healthy and the number of  40 pulsations, though truly aberrant in terms of the average number of 70, is  normal for this organism.28 Sigerist concludes, "we should not be content  with establishing the comparison with a norm resulting from the average, but  rather, insofar as it is possible, with the conditions of the individual exam­ ined" [107, 108] .  If the normal does not have the rigidity of a fact of collective constraint  but rather the flexibility of a norm which is transformed in its relation to  individual conditions, it is clear that the boundary between the normal and  the pathological becomes imprecise. But this in no way leads us to continuity  between a normal and a pathological identical in essence save for quantitative  variations, nor to a relativity of health and disease so confUSing that one does  not know where health ends and disease begins. The borderline between the  normal and the pathological is imprecise for several individuals considered  Simultaneously but it is perfectly precise for one and the same individual con­ sidered successively. In order to be normative in given conditions, what is  normal can become pathological in another situation if it continues identical  105 </p><div id="pagenum"><p>123</p></div><p id="page">106 PART TWO  to itself. It is the individual who is the judge of this transformation because  it is he who suffers from it from the very moment he feels inferior to the  tasks which the new situation imposes on him. The children's nanny, who  perfectly discharges the duties of her post, is aware of her hypotension only  through the neuro-vegetative disturbances she experiences when she is taken  on vacation in the mountains. Of course, no one is obliged to live at high  altitudes. But one is superior if one can do it, for this can become inevitable  at any time. A norm of life is superior to another norm when it includes  what the latter permits and what it forbids. But in different situations there  are different norms, which, insofar as they are different, are all equal, and  so they are all normal. In this regard Goldstein pays a great deal of attention  to the sympathectomy experiments carried out on animals by Cannon and  his collaborators. The animals, whose thermoregulation has lost all its usual  flexibility and who are incapable of struggling for their food or against  their enemies, are normal only in laboratory surroundings where they are  sheltered from the brutal variations and sudden demands of adapting to  the environment [46, 276-77]. However, this normal is not called truly  normal. For it is normal for the non-domesticated and non-experimentally  prepared living being to live in an environment where fluctuations and new  events are possible.  As a consequence we must say that the pathological or abnormal state  does not consist in the absence of every norm. Disease is still a norm of  life but it is an inferior norm in the sense that it tolerates no deviation from  the conditions in which it is valid, incapable as it is of changing itself into  another norm. The sick living being is normalized in well-defined conditions  of existence and has lost his normative capacity, the capacity to establish  other norms in other conditions. It has long been noted that in tubercular  osteoarthritis of the knee, articulation is frozen in a faulty position (the  so-called Bonnet position). N6laton was the first to give it its still classic  explanation:  It is rare that the limb maintains its usual straightness. Indeed, in order to relieve their  suffering, the sick instinctively put themselves in an intermedtlry position between  flexion and extension, which causes the muscles to exert less pressure on the articular  surfaces [88,11, 209].  The hedonic and consequently normative significance of pathological be­ havior is perfectly perceived here. Articulation realizes its maximum capacity  under the influence of muscular contraction and struggles spontaneously  against pain. The position is said to be defective only in relation to an arti-</p><div id="pagenum"><p>124</p></div><p id="page">DISEASE, CURE, HEALTH 107  culation practice which admits of all the possible positions save anterior  flexion. But beneath this fault there is another norm, in other anatomic  and physiological conditions, which lies hidden.  The clinical observation of men with head wounds, systematically carried out  during the 1914-1918 war, allowed Goldstein to formulate some general  principles about neurological nosology which can be appropriately summa­ rized here.  If it is true that pathological phenomena are the regular modifications of  normal phenomena, the former can shed some light on the latter only on the  condition that the original meaning of this modification has been grasped.  We must begin first by understanding the pathological phenomenon as reveal­ ing a modified individual structure. One must always bear in mind the trans­ formation of the sick person's personality. Without this one runs the risk of  ignoring the fact that the sick person, even though capable of reactions simi­ lar to those previously possible to him, can arrive at these reactions by very  different paths. These reactions, which are apparently equivalent to previous  normal reactions, are not the residue of previous normal behavior; they are  not the result of an impoverishment or diminution; they are not the normal  mode of life minus something which has been destroyed: they are reactions  which never turn up in the normal subject in the same form and in the same  conditions [45] .  In order to define an organism's normal state, preferential behavior must  be taken into account; in order to understand disease, catastrophic reaction  must be taken into account. By preferential behavior it must be understood  that among all the reactions of which an organism is capable under experi­ mental conditions, only certain ones are used as those preferred. This mode  of life, which is characterized by a set of preferred reactions, is that in which  the living being responds best to the demands of his environment and lives in  harmony with it; it is that which includes the most order and stability, the  least hesitation, disorder and catastrophic reactions [46,24; -49,131-134].  Physiological constants (pulse, arterial pressure, temperature, etc.) express  this ordered stability of behavior for an individual organism in well-defined  environmental conditions.  Pathological phenomena are the expression of the fact that the normal relationships  between organism and environment have been changed through a change of the organ­ ism, and that thereby many things which had been adequate for the normal organism  are no longer adequate for the modified organism.  Disease is shock and danger for existence. Thus a definition of disease requires a </p><div id="pagenum"><p>125</p></div><p id="page">108 PART TWO  conception of the individual nature as a starting point. Disease appears when an organism  is changed in such a way that, though in its proper, 'normal' milieu, it suffers catastro­ phic reaction. This manifests itself not only in specific disturbances of performance,  corresponding to the locus of the defect, but in quite general disturbances because, as we  have seen, disordered behavior in any field coincides always with more or less disordered  behavior of the whole organism [46; English edition, p. 432 J .  What Goldstein pointed out in his patients is the establishment of new  norms of life by a reduction in the level of their activity as related to a new  but narrowed environment. The narrowing of the environment in patients  with cerebral lesions corresponds to their impotence in responding to the  demands of the normal, that is, previous environment. In an environment  which is not rigidly protected, these patients would know only catastrophic  reactions; insofar as the patient does not succumb to the disease, he is con­ cerned with escaping from the anguish of the catastrophic reactions. Hence  the mania for order and the meticulousness of these patients, their downright  taste for monotony and their attachment to a situation they know they can  dominate. The patient is sick because he can admit of only one norm. To use  an expression which has already been very useful to us, the sick man is not  abnormal because of the absence of a norm but because of his incapacity to  be normative.  With this view of disease we see how far we are from the conception of  Comte or Bernard. Disease is a positive, innovative experience in the living  being and not just a fact of decrease or increase. The content of the patho­ logical state cannot be deduced, save for a difference in format, from the  content of health; disease is not a variation on the dimension of health; it is  a new dimension of life. However new these views may seem to a French  public,29 they must not make one forget that in neurology they are the out­ come of a long and fertile evolution of ideas begun by Hughlings Jackson.  Jackson represents disease of the nervous system of the relational life as  dissolutions of hierarchical functions. Every disease corresponds to a level in  this hierarchy. In every interpretation of pathological symptoms the negative  as well as the positive aspect must be considered. Disease is both deprivation  and change. A lesion in the higher nervous system frees the lower regulatory  and control centers. Lesions are responsible for the loss of certain functions,  but the disturbances of existing functions must be attributed to the appropri­ ate activity of henceforth insubordinate centers. According to Jackson, no fact  can have a negative cause. Neither a loss nor an absence is sufficient to pro­ duce disturbance in sensory neuromotor behavior [38]. Just as Vauvenargues  says that people should not be judged on the basis of what they don't know, </p><div id="pagenum"><p>126</p></div><p id="page">DISEASE, CURE, HEALTH 109  so Jackson proposes this methodological principle which Head called the  golden rule: "Take note of what the patient really understands and avoid  terms such as amnesia, alexia, word deafness, etc." [87,759]. It means noth·  ing to say that a sick man has lost his speech if one does not specify in what  typical situation this lack is perceptible. If a so-called aphasic subject is asked:  Is your name John? he answers: No. But ifhe is ordered: Say no, he tries and  fails. The same word can be said if it has the value of an interjection and  cannot be 'said if it is a value judgment. Sometimes the sick person can't  pronounce the word but gets to the point with a periphrasis. Suppose, says  Mourgue, that the sick person, unable to name common objects, says, when  presented with an inkwell: "This is what I would call a porcelain pot for hold­ ing ink", does he have amnesia or not? [87, 760] .  Jackson's important point is that language and, generally speaking, every  function of relational life, is capable of several uses, in particular, an inten·  tional use and an automatic use. In intentional actions, there is a preconcep·  tion and action is carried out under control; it is dreamed of before being  effectively executed. With language, two moments in the elaboration of an  intentionally and abstractly signfiicant proposition can be distinguished: a  subjective moment, when notions automatically come to mind and an objec­ tive moment when they are intentionally arranged according to a proposi­ tional plan. A. Ombredane points out that the divergence varies between  these two momen ts depending on the languages:  If there are languages where this divergence is very pronounced, as we can see in the final  position of the verb in German, there are also languages where it is less. Moreover, if we  remember that for Jackson the aphasic can scarcely go beyond the order of the subjec­ tive moment of expression, we, like Arnold Pick, can admit that the gravity of the  aphasic disorder varies according to the structure of the language in which the sick  person tries to express himself [91, 194).  In short, Jackson's conceptions must serve as an introduction to Goldstein's.  The sick person must always be judged in terms of the situation to which he  is reacting and the instruments of action which the environment itself offers  him -language, in cases of language disturbances. There is no pathological  disturbance in itself, the abnormal can be evaluated only in terms of a rela­ tionship.  But no matter how correct the relationship established between Jackson  and Goldstein by Ombredane [91], Ey and Rouart [38], and Cassirer [22],  we should not ignore their profound difference and Goldstein's originality.  Jackson's is an evolutionist point of view and he admits that the hierarchical </p><div id="pagenum"><p>127</p></div><p id="page">110 PART TWO  centers of the relational functions correspond to different evolutionary stages.  The relation of functional dignity is also one of chronological succession:  higher and later functions are identified. The posteriority of the higher func·  tions explains their fragility and precariousness. As disease is dissolution, it is  also regression. The aphasic or apraxic rediscovers a child's or even an animal's  language or gestures. Disease, although it represents a change in what remains  and is not just the loss of what one had possessed, creates nothing, it throws  the sick person, as Cassirer says, "a step backward on the road mankind had  to clear slowly by means of constant effort" [22, 566]. Now if it is true,  according to Goldstein, that disease is a narrowed mode of life, lacking in  creative generosity because lacking in boldness, it is nevertheless true that for  the individual, disease is a new life, characterized by new physiological con·  stants and new mechanisms for obtaining apparently unchanged results.  Hence this warning, already cited:  One must refrain from believing that the various attitudes possible in a sick person repre·  sent just one kind of residue of normal behavior, what has survived destruction. The  attitudes which have survived in the sick person never arise in that form in the normal  person, not even at the lower stages of its ontogenesis or phylogenesis, as is too frequent·  ly assumed. Disease has given them particular forms which cannot be well understood  unless one considers the morbid state [45,437].  If it is possible, in effect, to compare the gesticulation of a sick adult with  that of a child, the essential likening of one to the other would lead to the  possibility of symmetrically defining the child's behavior as that of a sick  adult. This would be an absurdity because it ignores that eagerness which  pushes- the child to raise itself constantly to new norms, which is profoundly  at variance with the care to conserve which directs the sick person in his  obsessive and often exhausting maintenance of the only norms of life within  which he feels almost normal, that is, in a position to use and dominate his  own environment.  On this very point Ey and Rouart have grasped the inadequacy of Jack­ son's conception:  With regard to the psychic functions, dissolution produces both a capacitary regression  and an involution toward a lower level of personality evolution. Capacitary regression does  not exactly reproduce a past stage but it comes close to it (language, perceptual disturb·  ances, etc.). The involution of the personality, insofar as it is precisely totalitarian, can­ not be absolutely likened to a historical phase of ontogenic or phylogenic development,  for it bears the mark of capacitary regression, and furthermore, as a reactional mode of  the personality at the actual moment, it cannot go back to a past reactional mode, not  even if it is cut off from its higher circumstances. This explains why, for all the analogies </p><div id="pagenum"><p>128</p></div><p id="page">DISEASE, CURE, HEALTH III  drawn between delirium and the child's mentality or primitive mentality, we cannot  conclude that they are identical [38,327].  Again it was Jackson's ideas that guided Delmas-Marsalet in interpreting  results obtained in neuro-psychiatric therapy using electric shock. But not  content to distinguish negative disturbances in terms of deficiency and positive  disturbances in terms of the liberation of the remaining parts as Jackson did,  Delmas-Marsalet, like Ey and Rouart, insists on what disease shows up as  abnormaf, to put it exactly, as new. In a brain subjected to toxic, traumatic,  infectious effects, modifications consisting in new connections from area to  area, in different dynamic orientations, can appear. A whole cell, which is  quantitatively unchanged, is capable of a new arrangement, of different  'isomeric' connections as isomers in chemistry are composed in an identical  universal formula, but certain chains of which are placed differently in rela­ tion to a common nucleus. Form the therapeutic point of view, it must be  admitted that after dissolving neuropsychic functions, the coma obtained by  means of electric shock makes possible a reconstruction which is not neces­ sarily the inverted reappearance of stages in the previous dissolution. The cure  can just as well be interpreted as a change from one arrangement to another,  as seen as a restitution of the initial state [33]. If we point out these very  recent conceptions here, it is to show the extent to which the idea that the  pathological cannot be linearly deduced from the normal, tends to assert  itself. Those who would be put off by Goldstein's language and manner will  go along with Delmas-Marsalet's conclusions precisely because of what we  personally shall consider as their weakness, that is, the vocabulary and images  of psychological atomism (building, quarry stone, arrangement, architecture,  etc.) used to formulate them. But in spite of the language, their clinical inte­ grity establishes facts worth considering.  One may perhaps wish to object that in expounding Goldstein's ideas and  their relation to Jackson's, we are moving in the area of psychic rather than  somatic disturbances and that we are describing failures in psychomotor  utilization rather than alterations in functions which are, strictly speaking,  physiological, and which constitute the point of view we had said we had  especially wanted to assume. We could answer that we have tackled not only  the exposition but also the reading of Goldstein last and that all of the exam­ ples of pathological facts we have used to support our hypotheses and pro­ positions -for which Goldstein's ideas are an encouragement and not an  inspiration -are borrowed from physiological pathology. But we prefer to </p><div id="pagenum"><p>129</p></div><p id="page">112 PART TWO  set out new, indisputably physiological pathological works whose authors owe  nothing to Goldstein as far as the tendencies of their research are concerned.  In neurology it had long been noted through clinical observation and  experimentation that severing nerves involves symptoms which cannot be  adequately understood solely in terms of anatomical discontinuity. During  the 1914-1918 war, a body of facts concerned with secondary sensory  motor disturbances, following injuries and surgical operations, again attracted  attention. Explanations of that time introduced anatomical substitutes,  pseudorestoration, and as often happens, for what of something better,  pithiatism. Leriche's great merit is that from 1919 on he systematically  studied the physiology of nerve stumps and systematized his clinical observa­ tions under the name of 'neuroglioma syndrome". Nageotte called the swollen  stump, which is often very large, the amputation neuroma, made of axis  cylinders and neuroglia formed at the central end of a severed nerve. Leriche  was the first to see that the neuroma is the starting point for a reflex phe­ nomenon and he localized the origin of this so-called reflex in the neurites  spread through the central stump. The neuroglioma syndrome includes a  privative aspect, the appearance, in short, of an unprecedented disturbance.  Assuming that the sympathetic fibers are the ordinary path of excitation ori­ ginating at the level of the neuroglioma, Leriche thinks that these excitations  determine unusual vasomotor reflexes at the wrong time, which are almost always vaso­ constrictive, and these are the reflexes which, by producing hypermyotonia of smooth  fiber, determine a truly new disease at the periphery, juxtaposed to the sensory motor  deficiency related to severing the nerve. This new disease is characterized by cyanosis,  chill, edema, trophic disturbances, pain, etc. [74,153).  Leriche's therapeutic conclusion is that neuroglioma formation must be pre­ vented, particularly by means of a nerve graft. The graft does not perhaps  reestablish anatomical continuity but it does in some way set the extremity  of the central end and it channels the neurites by pushing them to the upper  end. A technique developed by Foerster can also be used which consists in  binding the neurolemma and mummifying the stump with an injection of  absolute alcohol.  A. G. Weiss, working along the same lines as Leriche, thinks still more  clearly than the latter that, with regard to disease of the neuroglioma, it is  appropriate and sufficient to suppress the neuroglioma right away without  losing time in 'miming' the reestablishment of anatomical continuity by  means of a graft or suture. With this procedure an integral restitution in the  area of the injured nerve cannot be expected with any assurance. But it is a </p><div id="pagenum"><p>130</p></div><p id="page">DISEASE, CURE, HEALTH 113  matter of choosing. For example, in the case of elbow seizure, one must  choose between waiting for possible improvement of the paralysis if restora­ tion of nervous continuity is effected following a graft, or immediately pro­ curing for the patient the use of one hand which will always be partially  paralyzed but which will be capable of very satisfying functional agility.  Klein's histological studies can perhaps explain all these phenomena [119].  Whatever the modalities of detail observed according to the cases (sclerosis,  inflammation, hemorrhage, etc.), every histolOgical examination of neuromata  shows one constant fact, namely the persistent contact established between  the axis cylinders neuroplasm and the proliferation, sometimes considerable,  of neurolemmata. This verification authorizes a close relationship between  the neuromata and the receptor endings of the general sensibility, constituted  by the ending of the neurites proper and by the elements differentiated but  always deriving from the neurolemmata. This close relationship would con­ firm Leriche's conceptions that the neuroglioma is indeed a starting point for  unusual excitations.  Be that as it may, A. G. Weiss and J. Warter are justified in asserting:  To an uncommon degree the disease of the neuroglioma goes beyond the framework  of the simple, sensitive motor interruption and very often, because of its seriousness, it  constitutes the essence of the infmnity. This is so true that if one somehow succeeds in  freeing the patient from disturbances linked to the existence of the neuroglioma, the  sensory motor paralYSis which persists assumes a truly secondary aspect, often compati­ ble with almost normal use of the affected member [1181.  The example of neuroglioma disease seems to us perfectly suited to illus­ trate the idea that disease is not merely the disappearance of a physiological  order but the appearance of a new vital order, an idea which is as much  Leriche's -as we saw in the first part of this study -as Goldstein's and which  could correctly justify the Bergsonian theory of disorder. There is no dis­ order, there is the substitution for an expected or loved order of another  order which either makes no difference or from which one suffers.  But Weiss and Warter, in pointing out that a functional restitution, satisfying  in the eyes of the patient and also his doctor, can be obtained without a  restitutio ad integrum in the theoretically corresponding anatomical order,  confirm Goldstein's ideas on cure in a way which is certainly unexpected for  them. Goldstein says  Thus, being well means to be capable of ordered behavior which may prevail in·spite of  the impossibility of certain performances which were formerly possible. But the new </p><div id="pagenum"><p>131</p></div><p id="page">114 PART TWO  state of health is not the same as the old one .... Just as a definite condition as to con­ tents belongs to the former state of normality, so also a definite condition as to contents  belongs to the new normality; but of course the contents of both conditions differ. This  conclusion, which follows as a matter of course from our concept of the organism which  is also determined as to contents, becomes of the greatest importance for the physician's  attitude towards those who have regained their health .... To become well again, in  spite of defects, always involves a certain loss in the essential nature of the organism.  This coincides with the reappearance of order. A new individual norm corresponds to  this rehabilitation.  How very important the regaining of order is for recuperation can be seen from the  fact that the organism seems primarily to have the tendency to preserve, or gain, such  capacities which make this possible. The organism fust of all appears set on gaining con­ stants anew. We may find in recovery (with residual defect) changes in various fields as  compared to the former nature of the organism; but the behavior shows that the charac­ ter of the performances is again 'constant'. We find constants in the bodily as well as in  the mental field. For instance, as compared to the former behavior, we fmd a change in a  pulse rate, blood pressure, silgar content of the blood, in thresholds, mental perform­ ances, etc., but this modification is one of newly formed constants in the respective  fields. These new constants guarantee the new order. We can understand the behavior  of the recuperated organism only u: we consider this fact. We must not attempt to inter­ fere with these new constants, because we would thus create new disorders. We have  learned that fever is not always to be combated, but that an increase in temperature may  be understood as one of those constants which are necessary to bring about the recovery.  We have learned to treat quite similarly certain forms of increased blood pressure or cer­ tain psychological changes. There are many such alterations of constants which today we  still attempt to remove for their alleged harmfulness, whereas it would be better not to  interfere with them. [46 ; English edition, pp. 437-38].  One would gladly emphasize here -as opposed to one way of citing Gold­ stein which gives the appearance of initiation into a hermetic or paradoxical  physiology -the objectivity and even banality of his leading ideas. It is not  only the observations of clinicians (who are unfamiliar with his theses) but  also experimental verifications which go along the lines of his own research.  Didn't Kayser write in 1932:  The areflexia observed after a transverse spinal section stems from the interruption of  the reflex arc itself. The disappearance of the state of shock accompanied by the reap­ pearance of the reflexes is not, strictly speaking, a reestablishment but rather the consti­ tution of a new 'reduced' individual A new entity is created, 'the spinal animal' (von  Wei13aecker) [63 bis, 115].  In asserting that new physiological norms are not the equivalent of norms  existing before the disease, Goldstein, on the whole, only confirms the funda­ mental biological fact that life does not recognize reversibility. But if life does  not admit of reestablishments, it does admit of repairs which are really phy-</p><div id="pagenum"><p>132</p></div><p id="page">DISEASE, CURE, HEALTH 11S  siological innovations. The more or less large reduction of these innovation  possibilities is a measure of the seriousness of the disease. As far as health in  the absolute sense is concerned, it is nothing other than the initial boundless  capacity to institute new biological norms.  The frontispiece of Vol. VI of the Encyclopedie /ran(]aise, 'The Human Being',  published under Leriche's direction, shows health in the guise of an athlete  throwing weights. This simple image seems to us to be as fully instructive as  all the pages following, which are devoted to describing the normal man. We  now want to gather together all our reflections scattered throughout earlier  explanations and critical examinations in order to outline a definition of  health.  If we acknowledge the fact that disease remains a kind of biological norm,  this means that the pathological state cannot be called abnormal in an abso­ lute sense, but abnormal in relation to a well-defined situation. Inversely,  being healthy and being normal are not altogether equivalent since the patho­ logical is one kind of normal. Being healthy means being not only normal in a  given situation but also normative in this and other eventual situations. What  characterizes health is the possibility of transcending the norm, which defines  the momentary normal, the possibility of tolerating infractions of the habit­ ual norm and instituting new norms in new situations. In an environment  and system of given requirements, one remains normal with one kidney. But  one can no longer allow onself the luxury of losing a kidney, one must take  care of it and oneself. Common sense medical prescriptions are so familiar  that we don't look for deep meaning in them. And yet how distressing and  difficult it is to obey the doctor who says: Take care of yourself! "It is very  easy to say take care of myself but I have my household to run", said the  mother of a family in a hospital consultation, who, in saying it, had no inten­ tion of being ironic, no idea of semantics. 30 A household is the contingency  of a sick husband or child, a torn pair of pants which must be mended in the  evening when the child is in bed since he has only one pair of pants, the long  trip to the bakery for bread if the usual one is closed for breaking the law,  etc. How· difficult it is to take care of oneself when one lived without know­ ing at what time one ate, whether the stairs were steep or not, the hour of the  last tram since, if it were past, one would go home on foot, even a long way.  Health is a margin of tolerance for the inconstancies of the environment.  But isn't it absurd to speak of the inconstancy of the environment? This is  true enough of the human social environment where institutions are funda­ mentally precarious, conventions revocable, and fashions as fleeting as light-</p><div id="pagenum"><p>133</p></div><p id="page">116 PART TWO  ning. But isn't the cosmic environment, the animal environment in general a  system of mechanical, physical and chemical constants, made of invariants?  Certainly this environment, which science defines, is made of laws but these  laws are theoretical abstractions. The living creature does not live among laws  but among creatures and events which vary these laws. What holds up the bird  is the branch and not the laws of elasticity. If we reduce the branch to the  laws of elasticity, we must no longer speak of a bird, but of colloidal solu­ tions. At such a level of analytical abstraction, it is no longer a question of  environment f~>r a living being, nor of health nor of disease. Similarly, what  the fox eats is the hen's egg and not the chemistry of albuminoids or the laws  of embryology. Because the qualified living being lives in a world of qualified  objects, he lives in a world of possible accidents. Nothing happens by chance,  everything happens in the form of events. Here is how the environment is  inconstant. Its inconstancy is simply its becoming, its history.  For the living being life is not a monotonous deduction, a rectilinear move­ ment, it ignores geometrical rigidity, it is discussion or explanation (what  Goldstein calls Auseinandersetzung) with an environment where there are  leaks, holes, escapes, and unexpected resistances. Let us say it once more. We  do not profess indeterminism, a position very well supported today. We main­ tain that the life of the living being, were it that of an amoeba, recognizes the  categories of health and disease only on the level of experience, which is  primarily a test in the affective sense of the word, and not on the level of  science. Science explains experience but it does not for all that annul it.  Health is a set of securities and assurances (what the Germans call Sich­ erungen) , securities in the present, assurances for the future. As there is a  psychological assurance which is not presumption, there is a biolOgical assur­ ance which is not excess, and which is health. Health is a regulatory fly-wheel  of the possibilities of reaction. Life is usually just this side of its possibilities,  but when necessary it shows itself above its anticipated capacity. This is clear  in inflammation defense reactions. If the fight against infection were instan­ taneously victorious, there would be no inflammation. If organic defenses  were immediately forced, there would no longer be inflammation. If inflam­ mation exists it is because the anti-infectious defense is at once surprised and  mobilized. To be in good health means being able to fall sick and recover, it is  a biological luxury .  Inversely disease is characterized by the fact that it is a reduction in the  margin of tolerance for the environment's inconstancies. In speaking of reduc­ tion we do not mean to fall subject to the criticism we gave of the concep­ tions of Comte and Bernard. This reduction consists in being able to live only </p><div id="pagenum"><p>134</p></div><p id="page">DISEASE, CURE, HEALTH 117  in another environment and not merely in some parts of the previous one.  This is what Goldstein saw very clearly. At bottom, popular anxiety in the  face of the complications of disease expresses nothing but this experience. We  are more concerned about the disease any given disease may plunge us into  than about the disease itself, for it is more a matter of one disease precipitat­ ing another than a complication of disease. Each disease reduces the ability to  face others, uses up the initial biological assurance without which there would  not even be life. Measles is nothing, but it's bronchial pneumonia that we  dread. Syphilis is so feared only after it strikes the nervous system. Diabetes  is not so serious if it is just glycosuria. But coma? gangrene? what will happen  if surgery is necessary? Hemophilia is really nothing as long as a traumatism  does not occur. But who isn't in the shadow of a traumatism, barring a return  to intrauterine existence? If then!  Philosophers argue as to whether the living being's fundamental tendency  is to conserve or expand. Medical experience would indeed seem to bring to  bear an important argument in the debate. Goldstein notes that the morbid  concern to avoid situations which might eventually generate catastrophic  reactions expresses the conservation instinct. According to him, this instinct  is not the general law of life but the law of a withdrawn life. The healthy  organism tries less to maintain itself in its present state and environment than  to realize its nature. This requires that the organism, in facing risks, accepts  the eventuality of catastrophic reactions. The healthy man does not flee  before the problems posed by sometimes sudden disruptions of his habits,  even physiologically speaking; he measures his health in terms of his capacity  to overcome organic crises in order to establish a new order [49].  Man feels in good health -which is health itself -only when he feels  more than normal -that is, adapted to the environment and its demands - but normative, capable of follOwing new norms of life. It is obviously not  with the express intention of giving men this feeling that nature built their  organisms with such prodigality: too many kidneys, too many lungs, too  much parathyroid, too much pancreas, even too much brain, if human life  were limited to the vegetative life.31 * Such a way of thinking expresses the  most naive fatalism. But it has always been so: man feels supported by a  superabundance ~f means which it is normal for him to abuse. As opposed to  some doctors who are too quick to see crimes in diseases because those affect­ ed committed some excess or omission somewhere, we think that the power  and temptation to fall sick are an essential characteristic of human physiology.  To paraphrase a saying of Valery, we have said that the possible abuse of  health is part of health. </p><div id="pagenum"><p>135</p></div><p id="page">118 PART TWO  In order to evaluate the nonnal and the pathological, human life must not  be limited to vegetative life. If need be, a man can live with many malfonna­ tions or ailments but he can make nothing of his life, or, at least, he can  always make something of it and it is in this sense that if it represents adapta­ tion to imposed circumstances, every state of the organism, insofar as it is  compatible with life, ends up being basically nonnal. But this nonnality is  payed for by renouncing all eventual normativity. Man, even physical man, is  not limited to his organism. Having extended his organs by means of tools,  man sees in his body only the means to all possible means of action. Thus, in  order to discern what is nonnal or pathological for the body itself, one must  look beyond the body. With a disability like astigmatism or myopia, one  would be nonnal in an agricultural or a pastoral society but abnormal for sail­ ing or flying. From the moment mankind technically enlarged its means of  locomotion, to feel abnonnal is to realize that certain activities, which have  become a need and an ideal, are inaccessible. Hence we cannot clearly under­ stand how the same man with the same organs feels nonnal or abnonnal at  different times in environments suited to man unless we understand how  organic vitality flourishes in man in the form of technical plasticity and the  desire to dominate the environment.  If we now move back from these analyses to the concrete feeling of the  state they are trying to define, we will understand that for man health is a  feeling of assurance in life to which no limit is fixed. Valere, from which value  derives, means to be in good health in Latin. Health is a way of tackling exist­ ence as one feels that one is not only possessor or bearer but also, if necessary,  creator of value, establisher of vital nonns. Hence this seduction still exerted  on our minds today by the image of the athlete, a seduction of which con­ temporary infatuation for organized sport seems to us to be merely a sad  caricature. 32 </p><div id="pagenum"><p>136</p></div><p id="page">v  PHYSIOLOGY AND PATHOLOGY  As a consequence of the preceding analyses, it seems that a definition ofphy­ siology as the science of the laws or constants of normal life would not be  strictly exact for two reasons: first, because the concept of normal is not a  concept of existence, in itself susceptible of objective measurement; and  second, because the pathological must be understood as one type of normal,  as the abnormal is not what is not normal, but what constitutes another nor­ mal. This does not mean that physiology is not a science. It is genuinely so in  terms of its search for constants and invariants, its metrical procedures, and  its general analytical approach. But it is easy to specify how phYSiology is a  science in terms of its method, less easy to specify of what, in terms of its  object. Shall we call it the science of the conditions of health? In our opinion  this would already be preferable to the science of the normal functions of life  since we have believed we must distinguish between the normal state and  health. But one difficulty persists. When we think of the object of a science  we think of a stable object identical to itself. In this respect, matter and mo­ tion, governed by inertia, fulfill every requirement. But life? Isn't it evolution,  variation of forms, invention of behaviors? Isn't its structure historical as well  as histological? PhYSiology would then tend toward history, which is not, no  matter what you do, the science of nature. It is true that we are nonetheless  struck by life's stable quality. In short, in order to define physiology, every­ thing depends on one's concept of health. Raphael DubOiS, who is, to our  knowledge, the only nineteenth century author of a work on physiology in  which a not merely etymological or purely tautological definition of it is pro­ posed, derives its meaning from the Hippocratic theory of natura medicatrix:  The role of natura medicatrix is identified with that of the normal functions of the  organism which are all more or less directly conservative or defensive. Physiology is the  study of nothing other than the functions of living beings, or in other words, the normal  phenomena of the living proteon or bioproteon [35,10).  Now if we agree with Goldstein that there is only a really conservative ten­ dency in disease, that the healthy organism is characterized by the tendency  to face new situations and institute new norms, we cannot be satisfied with  such a view.  119 </p><div id="pagenum"><p>137</p></div><p id="page">120 PART TWO  Sigerist, who tries to define physiology by understanding the significance  of the first discovery which gave rise to it -Harvey's discovery of the circula­ tion of the blood (1628) -proceeds in his usual fashion, which is to place  this discovery within the intellectual history of civilization. Why did a func­ tional conception of life appear then, not sooner, not later? Sigerist does not  separate the science of life, born in 1628, from the general, let us say, philo­ sophical conception of life which was then expressed in the individual's  various attitudes toward the world. From the end of the sixteenth and the  beginning of the seventeenth century the plastic arts first established the  baroque style and liberated movement everywhere. The baroque artist, as  opposed to the classical artist, sees in nature only what is uncompleted, po­ tential, not yet circumscribed.  Baroque man is not interested in what is, but what is on the way to being. The baroque  is infinitely more than a style in art, it is the expression of a form of thought which at  this time governs all areas of the human spirit: literature, music, fashion, the State, the  mode of living, the sciences [107, 41].  In establishing anatomy at the beginning of the sixteenth century men favored  the living form's static, delimited aspect. What Wolfflin says of the baroque  artist, that he sees not the eye but the gaze, Sigerist says of the physician at  the beginning of the seventeenth century:  He does not see the muscle but its contraction and the effect it produces. This is how  anatomia animata, physiology, is born. The object of this science is movement. It opens  the doors to the unlimited. Each physiological problem leads to the sources of life and  and permits an escape to infmity [ibid.].  Harvey, though an anatomist, saw not form but movement in the body. His  research is not based on the configuration of the heart but on observing the  pulse and respiration, two movements that cease only with life. The func­ tional idea in medicine is connected with Michelangelo's art and Galileo's  dynamic mechanics [107,42] .33  It seems to us, following earlier considerations on health, that it goes with­ out saying that this 'spirit' of nascent physiology must be kept in the defini­ tion of physiology as the science of the conditions of health. We have spoken  on several occasions of the modes of life, preferring this expression in certain  cases to the term behavior in order to emphasize better the fact that life is  dynamiC polarity. It seems to us that in defining physiology as the science of  the stabilized modes of life, we are meeting almost all the demands stemming  from our previous positions. On the one hand we are assigning to research an  object whose identity to itself is that of habit rather than nature, but whose </p><div id="pagenum"><p>138</p></div><p id="page">PHYSIOLOGY AND PATHOLOGY 121  relative constancy is perhaps more exactly adequate to take into account the  nonetheless fluctuating phenomena with which the physiologist is concerned.  On the other hand we reserve the possibility for life to go beyond the codified  biological constants or invariants conventionally held as norms at a specific  moment of physiological knowledge. In effect modes can be established only  after having been put to the test by disrupting an earlier stability. Finally it  seems to us that starting from the definition proposed, we are able to delimit  correctly the relations between physiology and pathology.  There are two kinds of original modes of life. There are those which are  stabilized in new constants but whose stability will not keep them from being  eventually transcended again. These are normal constants with propulsive val­ ue. They are truly normal by virtue of their normativity. And there are those  which will be stabilized in the form of constants, which the living being's  every anxious effort will tend to preserve from every eventual disturbance.  These are still normal constants but with repulsive value expressing the death  of normativity in them. In this they are pathological, although they are normal  as long as the living being is alive. In short, the moment physiological stability  is ruptured in a period of evolving crisis, physiology loses its rights but it does  not for all that lose the thread. It does not know in advance whether the new  biological order will be physiological or not, but later on it will have the means  to find once more among the constants those which it claims for its own. This  will be the case, for example, if the environment is made to vary experimental­ ly in order to learn whether the constants which are maintained can accomo­ date themselves or not without catastrophe to a fluctuation in the conditions  of existence. This is, for example, the leading thread which allows us to under­ stand the difference between immunity and anaphylaxis. The presence of  antibodies in the blood is common to both forms of reactivity. But while  immunity makes the organism insensible to an intrusion of microbes or toxins  in the inner environment, anaphylaxis is an acquired supersensitivity to the  penetrati9n of specific, particularly protein, substances into the inner environ-'  ment[104] . After a first modification (by infection, or injection, or intoxi­ cation) of the inner environment, a second break-in is ignored by the immu­ nized organism, while in the case of anaphylaxis, it provokes a shock reaction  of extreme gravity, very often fatal, so sudden that it has qualified the experi­ mental injection which provokes it with the term unleashing [dEichainante] ,  hence a typically catastrophic reaction. The presence of antibodies in blood  serum is thus always normal, the organism having reacted by modifying its  constants to a first aggression of the environment and being regulated by it,  but in one case the normality is physiological, in the other, pathological. </p><div id="pagenum"><p>139</p></div><p id="page">122 PART TWO  According to Sigerist, Virchow defined pathology as a "physiology with  obstacles" [107, 137]. This way of understanding disease by deriving it from  normal functions, thwarted by a foreign addition which complicates them  without altering them, comes close to the ideas of Claude Bernard and pro­ ceeds from very simple pathogenic principles. We know, for example, how a  heart or kidney is made, how blood or urine passes through them; if we  imagine the ulcerating growths of endocarditis on the mitral valve or a stone  in the renal pelvis, we are in a position to understand the pathogeny of symp­ toms such as heart murmur or pain radiating from nephretic colic. But per­ haps there is confusion in this conception, of a pedagogical and heuristic  kind. Medical teaching rightly begins with the anatomy and physiology of the  normal man, starting from which the reason for certain pathological states  can sometimes be easily deduced by acknowledging certain mechanical anal­ ogies, for example, in the circulatory system: cardiac liver, dropsy, edemas;  in the sensory motor system: hemianopsia or paraplegia. It seems that the  order of acquiring these anatomic and physiological correspondences has been  inverted. First of all, it is the sick man who one day ascertained that 'some­ thing was wrong'; he noticed certain surprising or painful changes in his mor­ phological structure or behavior. Rightly or wrongly he called them to the  attention of his doctor. The latter, alerted by his patient, proceeded to a  methodical exploration of the patent symptoms and even more the latent  symptoms. If the patient died, an autopsy was performed, all kinds of means  were employed to look for certain peculiarities in all the organs, which were  compared with the organs of individual dead men who had never shown simi­ lar symptoms. The clinical observation and the autopsy report were com­ pared. Here is how pathology, thanks to pathological anatomy but also thanks  to hypotheses or knowledge concerning functional mechanisms, has become a  physiology with obstacles.  Now here is a professional oversight -perhaps capable of being explained  by the Freudian theory of lapses and failed acts -:-which must be pointed  out. The physician has a tendency to forget that it is the patients who call  him. The physiologist has a tendency to forget that a clinical and therapeutic  medicine, which was not always so absurd as one might think, preceded phy­ siology. Once this oversight is remedied, we are led to think that it is the  experience of an obstacle, first lived by a concrete man in the form of disease,  which has given rise to pathology in its two aspects, clinical semiology and  the physiological interpretation of symptoms. If there were no pathological  obstacles there would be no physiology because there would be no physio­ logical problems to solve. Summarizing the hypotheses we proposed in the </p><div id="pagenum"><p>140</p></div><p id="page">PHYSIOLOGY AND PATHOLOGY 123  course of examining Leriche's ideas, we can say that in biology it is the pathos  which conditions the logos because it gives it its name. It is the abnormal  which arouses theoretical interest in the normal. Norms are recognized as  such only when they are broken. Functions are revealed only when they fail.  Ufe rises to the consciousness and science of itself only through maladapta­ tion, failure, and pain. A. Schwartz, following Ernest Naville, points out the  glaring disproportion between the place occupied by sleep in men's lives and  the place accorded it in works of physiology [105], just as Georges Dumas  points out that the bibliography on pleasure is minute compared to the  plethora of works devoted to pain. This is because the essence of sleep and  enjoyment is to let life go on without calling it to account.  In the Traite de physiologie normale et pathologique ['Treatise on Normal  and Pathological Physiology'] [1], Abelous credits Brown-Sequard with  having founded endocrinology by determining in 1856 that cutting out the  adrenal glands brought about the death of an animal. It seems that this is a  fact which is sufficient in itself. The question is not asked as to how it oc­ curred to Brown-Sequard to carry out the removal of the adrenal glands. In  the ignorance of the adrenal glands' functions, this is not a decision that one  reaches by deduction. No, but it is the reflection of an accident. And in fact  Sigerist shows that it is clinical practice which stimulated endocrinology. In  1855 Addison described the disease which since then has carried his name and  which he attributed to an attack on the adrenal glands [107; 57]. Starting  from this, Brown-Sequard's experimental research is understood. In the same  Traite de physiologie [112, 1011], Tournade judiciously points out the rela­ tion between Brown-Sequard and Addison and relates this anecdote of great  epistemological Significance: in 1716 the Bordeaux Academy of Sciences  proposed as the subject of a competition: "What are the adrenal glands used  for?" Montesquieu, who was responsible for the report, concluded that no  paper submitted could satisfy the Academy's curiosity and added: "One day  perhaps chance will accomplish everything that all the effort in the world  could not".  To take another example from the same kind of research, all physiolOgists  trace the 1884 discovery of the role of the pancreatic hormone in glucide  metabolism to von Mering and Minkowski. But it is often not known that if  these two researchers made a dog diabetic, as famous in pathology as Saint  Roch's in hagiography, it was quite unintentional. It was in studying external  pancreatic secretion and its role in digestion that the dog had its pancreas  removed. Naunyn, in whose department the experiment took place, says that  it was summer and the lab boy was struck by the unusual number of flies </p><div id="pagenum"><p>141</p></div><p id="page">124 PART TWO  around the animal cages. Naunyn, acting on the principle that where there is  sugar, there are flies, recommended that the dog's urine be analyzed. Von  Mering and Minkowski, then, by means of the pancreatectomy, had brought  into being a phenomenon analogous to diabetes [2]. Thus artifice makes  clarification possible, but without premediatation.  likewise we should think a moment about these words of Dejerine:  It is almost impossible to describe precisely the symptoms of paralysis of the glosso­ pharyngeal nerve: in effect physiology has not yet established exactly the motor distri­ bution of this nerve and on the other hand isolated paralysis of the glossopharyngeal  nerve is never observed, so to speak, in clinical practice. In reality the glossopharyngeal  nerve is always injured with the pneumogastric nerve or the spinal nerve, etc. [31,587].  It seems to us that the first if not the only reason why physiology has not yet  established the exact motor distribution of the glossopharyngeal nerve is  precisely because this nerve gives rise to no isolated pathological syndrome.  When I. Geoffroy Saint-Hilaire attributed the gap corresponding to hetero­ taxies in the teratological science of his time to the absence of every mor­ phological or functional symptom, he gave evidence of very rare perspicacity.  Virchow's conception of the relationship between physiology and pathol­ ogy is inadequate not only because it ignores the normal order of logical  subordination between physiology and pathology, but also because it implies  that disease creates nothing of its own accord. We have dealt too explicitly on  this last point to come back to it again. But the two errors seem to us to be  connected. It is because disease is allowed no biological norm of its own that  nothing is expected from it for the science of the norms of life. An obstacle  would only slow down or stop or divert a force or current without altering  them. Once the obstacle is removed, the pathological would again become  physiological, the earlier physiological. Now this is what we cannot admit,  following either Leriche or Goldstein. The new norm is not the old norm.  And as this capacity to establish new constants with the value of norm has  seemed to us to be characteristic of the living being's physiological aspect, we  cannot admit that physiology can be constituted before and independently of  pathology in order to establish it objectively.  Today it is not thought possible to publish a treatise on normal physiology  without a chapter devoted to immunity, to allergy. Knowledge of the latter  phenomenon reveals to us that about 97% of white men show a positive skin­ test to tuberculin, without all of them, however, being tubercular. And yet  this is the famous mistake of Koch, who is the source of this knowledge. Hav­ ing ascertained that the tuberculin injection in an already tubercular subject </p><div id="pagenum"><p>142</p></div><p id="page">PHYSIOLOGY AND PATHOLOGY 125  gives rise to serious accidents, while it is harmless for a healthy subject, Koch  believed that in tuberculinization he had found an infallible diagnostic tool.  But having also wrongly attributed to it a curative value, he obtained results  whose sad memory was effaced only by their subsequent conversion into a  precise diagnostic instrument and preventive detection, namely the skin-test  ascribed to von Pirquet. Almost every time that someone says in human  physiology: "Today we know that ... " one would find by looking hard - and without wishing to diminish the role of experimentation -that the prob­ lem was posed and its solution often outlined by clinical practice and thera­ peutics and very frequently at the expense, biologically speaking, of the  patient. Thus, if Koch discovered in 1891 the phenomenon which bears his  name and from which arose the theory of allergy and the skin-test technique,  Marfan, as early as 1886, relying on the rarity of the coexistence of tubercular  bone localizations, such as coxalgia or POtt's disease, and phthisis, had the  intuition, clinically speaking, that certain tubercular manifestations could  determine an immunity for others. In short, in the case of allergy, a general  phenomenon of which anaphylaxis is one type, we discern the transition from  an ignorant physiology to a knowing physiology by means of clinical practice  and therapeutics. Today an objective pathology proceeds from physiology  but yesterday physiology proceeded from a pathology which must be called  subjective and thereby certainly imprudent, but certainly bold, and thereby  progressive. All pathology is subjective with regard to tomorrow.  Is it only with regard to tomorrow that pathology is subjective? In this sense  all science, which is objective in terms of its method and object, is subjective  with regard to tomorrow since, short of assuming it to be completed, many  of today's truths will become a yesterday's mistakes. When Bernard and  Virchow, each on his own, aimed at establishing an objective pathology, the  one in the form of a pathology of functional regulations, the other in the  form of cellular pathology, they tended to incorporate pathology into the  sciences of nature, to found it on the bases of law and determinism. 34* It  is this claim that we want to subject to examination. If it has not seemed  possible to maintain the definition of physiology as the science of the normal,  it seems difficult to admit that there can be a science of disease, that there  can be a purely scientific pathology.  These questions of medical methodology have not stirred up much interest  in France, neither on the part of philosophers nor on the part of physicians.  To my knowledge Pierre Delbet's old article in the collection De la methode  dans les sciences [32], has had no successors. On the other hand these prob-</p><div id="pagenum"><p>143</p></div><p id="page">126 PART TWO  lems have been treated with great consistency and care abroad, particularly in  Germany. We plan to borrow an exposition of the conceptions of Ricker and  Madgebourg and the controversies they provoked, as given by Herxheimer in  his Krankheitslehre der Gegenwart ['Contemporary Pathology'] (1927). We  are deliberately giving this exposition the form of a summary, paraphrased  and cut from quotations from pages 6 to 18 of Herxheimer's book [55] .35  Ricker expounded his ideas successively in the Entwurf einer Relations­ pathologie ['Outline of a Pathology of Relations'] (1905); Grundlinien einer  Logik der Physiologie als reiner Naturwissenschaft ['Fundamentals of a Logic  of Physiology as Pure Science'] (1912); Physiologie, Pathologie und Medizin  ['Physiology, Pathology, and Medicine'] (1923); Pathologie als Naturwissen­ schaft -Relationspathologie ['Pathology as Science -Pathology of Rela­ tions'] (1924). He delimits the areas of physiology, pathology, biology, and  medicine. The sciences of nature are based on methodical observation and  reflection on these observations with a view to explaining, that is, articulating  the causal relations between sensible, physical processes taking place in men's  environment to which men themselves belong as physical beings. This excludes  the psychism of the object of the sciences of nature. Anatomy describes mor­ phological objects, its results have no explanatory value in themselves, but  acquire it through their connection with the results of other methods, thus  contributing to the explanation of phenomena which are the object of an  independent science, physiology.  While physiology explores the course of these processes, which is more frequent, more  regular, and which is therefore called normal, pathology (which has been artificially  separated from physiology) is concerned with their rarer forms, which are called abnor­ mal; it must likewise be subjected to scientific methods. Physiology and pathology,  joined together as one science, which could only be called physiology, examine the  phenomena in physical man, with a yiew toward theoretical, scientific knowledge (La  pathologje comme science naturelle ['Pathology as Natural Science'], p. 321 [55, 7].  Physiology-pathology must determine the causal relations between physical  phenomena, but as no scientific concept of life exists -apart from a purely  diagnostic concept -it has nothing to do with aims or ends and consequently  with values in relation to life. All teleology, certainly not only transcendent  but also immanent, all teleology which starts from the organism's finality or  is related to it, to the preservation of life, etc., consequently every value judg­ ment, does not belong to the natural sciences, still less to physiology-pathology  [55, 7].  This does not exclude the legitimacy of value judgments or practical appli­ cations. But the former are relegated to biology as part of the philosophy of </p><div id="pagenum"><p>144</p></div><p id="page">PHYSIOLOGY AND PATHOLOGY 127  nature, hence part of philosophy; and the latter are relegated to medicine and  hygiene considered as applied, practical, teleological sciences with the task of  utilizing, according to their aims, what has been explained: "The teleological  thought of medicine rests on the judgments of causality of physiology and  pathology which form the scientific basis of medicine" [55,8]. Pathology, as  pure science of nature, must provide causal knowledge, but not produce value  judgments.  Herxheimer responds to these propositions of general logic by saying first  that it is not customary to class biology within philosophy as Ricker does,  because if one relies on the expositions of representatives of the philosophy  of values such as Windelband, Munsterburg, and Rickert, biology cannot be  granted the right to use really normative values; it must then be ranked among  the natural sciences. Furthermore certain concepts, like those of movement,  nutrition, generation, to which Ricker himself grants a teleological meaning,  are inseparable from pathology, both for psychological reasons peculiar to  the subject concerned with it and for reasons residing in the objects them­ selves with which it is concerned [55,8].  Indeed, on the one hand scientific judgment, even when related to value­ free objects, remains an axiological judgment because it is a psychological act.  From the purely logical or scientific point of view it can be 'advantageous',  according to Ricker himself, to adopt certain conventions or certain postu­ lates. And in this sense we can admit with Weigert or Peters a finality of the  living being's organization or functions. From this point of view, notions such  as those of activity, adaptation, regulation, and self-preservation -notions  which Ricker would eliminate from science -are advantageously maintained  in physiology and thus in pathology as well [55,9]. In short, as Ricker clearly  saw, scientific thOUght finds in everyday language, the non-scientific language  of the masses, a defective instrument. But as Marchand says, we are not there­ by obliged to "suspect a teleological ulterior motive in each simply descriptive  term". Everyday language is particularly inadequate in the sense that its terms  often have an absolute meaning while in our thought we give them only a  relative meaning. To say, for example, that a tumor has an autonomous exist­ ence does not mean that it is really independent of the paths, materials, and  modes of nutrition of the other tissues but that compared to these, it is rela­ tively independent. Even in physics and chemistry we use terms and expres­ sions with an apparently teleological significance; however, no one thinks that  they really correspond to psychical acts [55,10]. Ricker asks that biological  processes or relations not be deduced from qualities or capacities. The latter  must be analyzed in partial processes and their reciprocal reactions must be </p><div id="pagenum"><p>145</p></div><p id="page">128 PART TWO  ascertained. But he himself admits that where this analysis is unsuccessful - in the case of nerve excitability, for example -the notion of a quality is  inevitable and can serve as a stimulant for the search for the corresponding  process. In his mechanics of development (Entwicklungsmechanik) Roux is  obliged to admit certain qualities or properties of the egg, to use notions of  preformation, regulation, etc., and yet Roux's research revolves around the  causal explanation of the normal and abnormal processes of development  [55,11-12] .  On the other hand, if one takes the point of view of the very object of  research, one must verify a withdrawal of the pretensions of physico-chemical  mechanics not only in biology but even in physics and chemistry. In any case  pathologists who answer in the affirmative to the question as to whether the  teleological aspect of biological phenomena must be retained, are numerous,  notably Aschoff, Lubarsch, Ziehen, Bier, Hering, R. Meyer, Beitzke, B.  Fischer, Hueck, Roessle, Schwarz. With regard to serious brain lesions such as  in tabes [progressive emaciation] or general paralysis, Ziehen for example,  asks to what extent it is a matter of destructive processes and to what extent  it is a matter of defensive or restorative processes conforming to a purpose,  even if they lack it [55,12-13]. Schwartz's essay on 'La recherche du sens  comme categorie de la pensee medicale' ['The Investigation of Meaning as a  Category of Medical Thought'] must also be mentioned. He designates causal­ ity as a category -in the Kantian sense -of physics: "According to physics  the conception of the world is determined by the application of causality as  a category to a matter which is measurable, dispersed, without' quality". The  limits of such an application begin where such a breaking up into parts is not  possible, where in biology objects appear which are characterized by increas­ ingly distinct uniformity, individuality and totality. The competent category  here is that of 'meaning' [sens]. "Meaning is, so to speak, the organ through  which we grasp structure, the fact of having form, in our thought; it is the  reflection of structure in the consciousness of the observer". To the notion of  meaning, Schwarz adds that of purpose, though it belongs to another order of  value. But they have analogous functions in the two areas of knowledge and  becoming from which they derive common qualities:  Thus we grasp the meaning of our own organization in its tendency to preserve itself and  only an environmental structure which contains meaning allows us to see purposes in it.  Thus, through the consideration of purposes, the abstract category of meaning is filled  with a real life. Consideration of purposes (for example, as a heuristic method) still  remains always provisory, a substitute, so to speak, while waiting for the object's abstract  meaning to become accessible to us. </p><div id="pagenum"><p>146</p></div><p id="page">PHYSIOLOGY AND PATHOLOGY 129  By way of summary, in pathology a teleological way of looking at things is  no longer rejected in principle by the majority of present-day scientists, yet  terms with a teleological content have always been used without people being  aware of it [55,15-16]. Of course, taking biological purposes into considera­ tion must not exempt research from causal explanation. In this sense the Kan­ tian concept of finality is always relevant. It is. a fact, for example, that re­ moving the adrenal glands brings about death. To assert that the adrenal  capsule is necessary for life is a biological value judgment which does not  relieve one from inquiring in detail into the causes through which a useful  biological result is obtained. But in supposing that a complete explanation of  the adrenal glands' functions is possible, teleological judgment, which recog­ nizes the vital necessity of the adrenal capsule, would still retain its indepen­ dent value, precisely in consideration of its practical application. Analysis and  synthesis make a whole without one substituting for the other. We must be  aware of the difference between the two conceptions [55,17]. It is true that  the term 'teleology' has remained too charged with implications of a tran­ scendental kind to be gainfully employed; 'final' is already better; but what  would be better still would be 'organismic', perhaps, used by Aschoff because  it clearly expresses the fact of being related to the totality. This mode of  expression is suited to the present tendency in pathology and elsewhere to  put the total organism and its behavior again into the forefront [55,17].  Certainly Ricker does not absolutely proscribe such considerations but he  does want to eliminate them totally from pathology as science of nature in  order to relegate them to the philosophy of nature which he calls biology,  and as far as their practical application is concerned, to medicine. Now this  point of view poses precisely the question of whether such a distinction is  useful in itself. This has been almost unanimously denied, and, it seems, with  reason. Thus Marchand writes:  For it is indeed true that pathology is not merely a natural science as far as the object of  its research is concerned, but it also has the task of exploiting the result of its research  for practical medicine.  Heuck, referring to Marchand, says that this would be impossible without the  valorization and teleological interpretation of processes refused by Ricker.  Let's think about a surgeon. What would he say if a pathologist, after per­ forming a biopsy of a tumor, were to answer in sending him his findings, that  whether a tumor is malignant or benign is a question for philosophy, not pa­ thology? What would be gained in the division of labor advocated by Ricker?  To a greater extent practical medicine would not get the solid scientific terrain </p><div id="pagenum"><p>147</p></div><p id="page">130 PART TWO  on which it could be based. Hence we cannot go along with Honigmann, who,  while approving Ricker's ideas for pathology but rejecting them for the prac­ titioner, already draws the conclusion that physiology-pathology and anat­ omy must be shifted from the Faculty of Medicine to the Faculty of Science.  The result would be to condemn medicine to pure speculation and deprive  physiology-pathology of stimulants of the greatest importance. Lubarsch  took the right view of things when he said:  The dangers for general pathology and pathological anatomy lie primarily in the fact that  they would become too unilateral and too solitary; closer relations between them and  clinical practice as existed when pathology had not yet become a specialty, would cer­ tainly be of greater advantage to both parties [55,181.  There is no doubt that in defming the physiological state in terms of the fre­ quency, and the pathological state in terms of the rarity of the mechanisms  and structures they offer for consideration, Ricker can legitimately conceive  that both must depend on the same heuristic and explanatory treatment. As  we never believed it necessary to admit the validity of a statistical criterion,  we cannot admit that pathology is completely aligned with physiology and  becomes science while remaining science of the pathological. In fact all those  who accept the reduction of healthy and pathological biological phenomena  to statistical facts are led more or less rapidly to acknowledge this postulate,  implied in this reduction, that (according to a dictum of Mainzer quoted by  Goldstein): "there is no difference between healthy life and sick life" [46,  267] .  We have already seen when we examined Claude Bernard's theory in what  precise sense such a proposition can be defended. The laws of physics and  chemistry do not vary according to health or disease. But to fail to admit that  from a biological point of view, life differentiates between its states means  condemning oneself to be even unable to distinguish food from excrement.  Certainly a living being's excrement can be food for another living being  but not for him. What distinguishes food from excrement is not a physico­ chemical reality but a biological value. Likewise what distinguishes the phy­ siological from the pathological is not a physico-chemical objective reality but  a biological value. As Goldstein says, when we are led to think that disease is  not a biological category, this should already make us question the premises  from which we started:  How is it thinkable that disease and health should not be biological concepts! If we dis­ regard, for a moment, the complicated conditions in man, this statement is certainly not  valid for animals, where disease so frequently decides whether the individual organism is </p><div id="pagenum"><p>148</p></div><p id="page">PHYSIOLOGY AND PATHOLOGY 131  "to be or not to be". Just think what detrimental part disease plays in the life of the  undomesticated animal, i.e., the animal which does not benefit by the protection through  man! If the science of life is supposed to be incapable of comprehending the phenomena  of disease, one must doubt seriously the appropriateness of, and the truth in, the intrin­ sic categories of a science so construed. [46; English edition, p. 430).  Ricker of course acknowledges biological values but in refusing to incor­ porate values into the object to a science, he makes the study of these values  part of philosophy. He has been reproached -justly in our and Herxheimer's  opinion -for this inclusion of biology in philosophy.  How then to resolve this difficulty: if we look at it from the strictly objec­ tive point of view there is no difference between physiology and pathology; if  we look for a difference between them have we left scientific ground?  We would propose the following considerations as elements of a solution:  (I) In the strict sense of the term, according to French usage, the science  of an object exists only if this object allows measurement and causal explana­ tion, in short, analysis. Every science tends toward metrical determination  through establishing constants or invariants.  (II) This scientific point of view is an abstract point of view, it expresses  a choice and hence a neglect. To look for what men's lived experience is in  reality is to overlook what value it is capable of accepting for and by them.  Before science it is technologies, arts, mythologies, and religions which spon­ taneously valorize human life. After the appearance of science these same  functions still exist but their inevitable conflict with science must be regulat­ ed by philosophy, which is thus expressly philosophy of values.  (III) The living being, having been led, in his humanity, to give himself  methods and a need to determine scientifically what is real, necessarily sees  the ambition to determine what is real extend to life itself. Life becomes -in  fact, it has become so historically, not having always been so -an object of  science. The science of life finds that it has life as subject, since it is the enter­ prise of living men, and as object.  (IV) In seeking to determine the constants and invariants which really  define the phenomena of life, phYSiology is genuinely doing the work of  science. But in looking for what is the vital significance of these constants, in  qualifying some as normal and others as pathological, the physiologist does  more -not less -than the strict work of science. He no longer considers life  merely as a reality identical to itself but as polarized movement. Without  knowing it, the physiologist no longer considers life with an indifferent eye,  with the eye of a physicist studying matter; he considers life in his capacity as  a living being through whom life, in a certain sense, also passes. </p><div id="pagenum"><p>149</p></div><p id="page">132 PART TWO  (V) The fact is that the physiologist's scientific activity, however separate  and autonomous he may conceive of it in his laboratory, maintains a more or  less close, but unquestionable relationship with medical activity. It is life's  setbacks which draw and have drawn attention to it. Knowledge always has  its source in reflection on a setback to life. This does not mean that science is  a recipe for processes of action but that on the contrary the rise of science  presupposes an obstacle to action. It is life itself, through its differentiation  between its propulsive and repulsive behavior, which introduces the categories  of health and disease into human consciousness. These categories are biologi­ cally technical and subjective, not biologically scientific and objective. living  beings prefer health to disease. The physician has sided explicitly with the  living being, he is in the service of life and it is life's dynamic polarity which  he expresses when he speaks of the normal and the pathological. The physio­ logist is often a physician, always a living man, and this is why the physiolo­ gist includes in his basic concepts the fact that if the living being's functions  assume modes all equally explicable by the scientist, they are not for this  reason the same for the living being himself.  To summarize, the distinction between physiology and pathology has and can  only have a clinical significance. This is the reason why, contrary to all pre­ sent medical custom, we suggest that it is medically incorrect to speak of  diseased organs, diseased tissues, diseased cells.  Disease is behavior of negative value for a concrete individual living being  in a relation of polarized activity with his environment. In this sense, it is not  only for man -although the terms 'pathological' or 'malady,' through their  relation to pathos or mal, indicate that these notions are applied to all living  beings through sympathetic regression starting from lived human experience  -but for every living thing that there is only completely organic disease.  There are diseases of the dog and the bee.  To the extent that anatomical and physiological analysis breaks the organ­ ism down into organs and elementary functions, it tends to place disease on  the levei of partial anatomical and physiological conditions of the total struc­ ture or behavior as a whole. Depending on the degree of subtlety in the analy­ sis, disease will be placed at the organ level -and it is Morgagni -at the  tissue level -and it is Bichat -at the cellular level and it is Virchow. But in  doing this we forget that historically, logically, and histologically we reached  the cell by moving backwards, starting from the total organism; and thought,  if not the gaze [Ie regard], was always turned toward it. The solution to  a problem posed by the entire organism, first to the sick man, later to the </p><div id="pagenum"><p>150</p></div><p id="page">PHYSIOLOGY AND PATHOLOGY 133  clinician, has been sought in the tissue or cell. To look for disease at the level  of cells is to confuse the plane of concrete life, where biological polarity dis­ tinguishes between health and disease, with the plane of abstract science,  where the problem gets a solution. We do not mean that a cell cannot be sick  if by cell we mean an entire living'thing, as for example a protist [unicellular  organism], but we do mean that the living being's disease does not lodge in  parts of the organism. It is certainly legitimate to speak of a sick leucocyte  just as one has the right to consider the leucocyte outside of every relation to  the reticulo-endothelial system and the conjunctive system. But in this case  the leucocyte is considered as an organ and better as an organism in a defense  and reaction situation vis-a-vis an environment. In fact, the problem of indivi­ duality is posed here. The same biological given can be considered as part or  as whole. We suggest that it is as a whole that it can be called sick or not.  Cells of the renal or pulmonary or splenic parenchyma can be called sick  today or sick with a certain disease by a certain anatomist or pathologist, who  has perhaps never set foot in a hospital or clinic, only because these cells were  removed, or they resemble ones which were removed, yesterday or a hundred  years ago -it doesn't matter -by a practicing physician, cliniCian, and thera­ pist, from the cadaver or amputated organ of a man whose behavior he had  observed. This is so true that Morgagni, the founder of pathological anatomy,  in his fine epistle to the surgeon Trew at the beginning of his basic work,  enunciates the formal obligation of anatomic pathological exploration to  refer constantly to the anatomy of the normal living being, obviously, but  also and above all to clinical experience [85]. Virchow himself, coming to  Velpeau's aid in a famous discussion in which French micrographers argued  against him for the specific character of the cancerous element, proclaimed  that if the microscope is capable of serving clinical practice, it is up to clinical  practice to enlighten the microscope [116]. It is true that Virchow has else­ where and with the greatest clarity formulated a theory of disease of the parts  [rnaladie parcellaire] which our preceding analyses tend to refute. Did he not  say in 1895:  It is my idea that the essence of disease is a modified part of the organism or a modified  cell or modified aggregate of cells (or tissue or organ) .... In reality every sick part of  the body is in a parasitic relation to the rest of the healthy body to which it belongs and  lives at the expense of the organism [23,569).  It seems that today this atomistic pathology has been abandoned and that  disease is seen much more as a reaction of everything organic against the  attack of an element than as an attribute of the element itself. It is precisely </p><div id="pagenum"><p>151</p></div><p id="page">134 PART TWO  Ricker who, in Germany, is the great opponent of Virchow's cellular pathol­ ogy.36* What he calls the 'pathology of relations' is precisely the idea that  disease does not exist at the level of the supposedly autonomous cell but  consists for the cell in the relations above all with the blood and nervous  system, that is, with an interior environment and a coordinating organ which  make the organism's functioning a whole [55, 19] . It does not matter that  the content of Ricker's pathological theories seems arguable to Herxheimer  and others; what is interesting is the spirit of his attack. In short, when we  speak of objective pathology, when we think that anatomical and histological  observation, the physiological test, the bacteriological examination, are  methods which enable the diagnosis of disease to have scientific significance  -even, according to certain people, in the absence of all clinical inquiry and  exploration -we are, in our opinion, victims of the most serious philosophi­ cal and, therapeutically speaking, sometimes the most dangerous confusion. A  microscope, a thermometer, a culture medium know no medicine which the  physician would not know. They give a result. This result has no diagnostic  value in itself. In order to reach a diagnosis the sick person's behavior must be  observed. It is then discovered that one who has a LoftIer bacillus in his  pharynx does not have diphtheria. On the other hand, for another man, a  thorough and very accurately carried out clinical examination makes one  think of Hodgkin's disease when the pathological examination of a biopsy  reveals the existence of a thyroid tumor.  In pathology the first word historically speaking and the last word logi­ cally speaking comes back to clinical practice. Clinical practice is not and  will never be a science even when it uses means whose effectiveness is in­ creasingly guaranteed SCientifically. Clinical practice is not separated from  therapeutics, and therapeutics is a technique for establishing or restoring  the normal whose end, that is, the subjective satisfaction that a norm is  established, escapes the jurisdiction of objective knowledge. One does not  scientifically dictate norms to life. But life is this polarized activity of debate  with the environment, which feels normal or not depending on whether it  feels that it is in a normative position or not. The physician has sided with  life. Science serves him in fulfilling the duties ariSing from that choice. The  doctor is called by the patient. 37 It is the echo of this pathetic call which  qualifies as pathological all the sciences which medical technology uses to  aid life. Thus it is that there is a pathological anatomy, a pathological phy­ Siology, a pathological histology, a pathological embryology. But their  pathological quality is an import of technical and thereby subjective origin.  There is no objective pathology. Structures or behaviors can be objectively </p><div id="pagenum"><p>152</p></div><p id="page">PHYSIOLOGY AND PATHOLOGY 135  described but they cannot be called 'pathological' on the strength of some  purely objective criterion. Objectively, only varieties or differences can be  defined with postive or negative vital values. </p><div id="pagenum"><p>153</p></div><p id="page">CONCLUSION  In Part One we looked into the historical origins and analysed the logical  implications of the principle of pathology, so often still invoked, according to  which the morbid state in the living being is only a simple quantitative varia­ tion of the physiological phenomena which define the normal state of the  corresponding function. We think we have established the narrowness and  inadequacy of such a principle. In the course of the discussion and in the light  of the examples presented, we think we have furnished some critical argu­ ments to support proposals of method and doctrine which form the object of  Part Two and which we shall summarize as follows:  Types and functions can be qualified as normal with reference to the  dynamic polarity of life. If biological norms exist it is because life, as not  only subject to the environment but also as an institution of its own environ­ ment, thereby posits values not only in the environment but also in the organ­ ism itself. This is what we call biological normativity.  Without being absurd, the pathological state can be called normal to the  extent that it expresses a relationship to life's normativity. But without being  absurd this normal could not be termed identical to the normal physiological  state because we are dealing with other norms. The abnormal is not such be­ cause of the absence of normality. There is no life whatsoever without norms  of life, and the morbid state is always a certain mode of living.  The physiological state is the healthy state, much more than the normal  state. It is the state which allows the transition to new norms. Man is healthy  insofar as he is normative relative to the fluctuations of his environment.  According to us, physiological constants have, among all the possible vital  constants, a propulsive value. The pathological state, on the other hand, ex­ presses the reduction of the norms of life tolerated by the living being, the  precariousness of the normal established by disease. Pathological constants  have a repulsive and strictly conservative value.  Cure is the reconquest of a state of stability of physiological norms. It is  all the closer to health or disease as this stability is more or less open to even­ tual change. In any case no cure is a return to biological innocence. To be  cured is to be given new norms of life, sometimes superior to the old ones.  There is an irreversibility of biological normativity.  137 </p><div id="pagenum"><p>154</p></div><p id="page">138 PART TWO  The concept of norm is an original concept which, in physiology more  than elsewhere, cannot be reduced to an objective concept determinable by  scientific methods. Strictly speaking then, there is no biological science of the  normal. There is a science of biological situations and conditions called nor­ mal. That science is physiology.  The attribution of a value of 'normal' to constants whose physiology  scientifically determines the content, expresses the relation of the science of  life to life's normative activity and, as far as the science of human life is con­ cerned, to biological techniques of production and establishment of the nor­ mal, and more especially to medicine.  It is with medicine as with all other technologies. It is an activity rooted in  the living being's spontaneous effort to dominate the environment and organ­ ize it according to his values as a living being. It is in this spontaneous effort  that medicine finds its meaning, if not at first all the critical clarity which  renders it infallible. Here is why medicine, without being a science itself, uses  the results of all the sciences in the service of the norms of life.  Thus it is first and foremost because men feel sick that a medicine exists.  It is only secondarily that men know in what way they are sick because a  medicine exists.  Every empirical concept of disease preserves a relation to the axiological  concept of disease. Consequently it is not an objective method which quali­ fies a considered biological phenomenon as pathological. It is always the rela­ tion to the individual patient through the intermediary of clinical practice,  which justifies the qualification of pathological. While admitting the impor­ tance of objective methods of observation and analysis in pathology, it does  not seem possible that we can speak with any correct logic of 'objective  pathology'. Certainly a pathology can be methodical, critical, and fortified  experimentally. It can be called objective with reference to the physician who  practices it. But the pathologist's intention is not that his object be a matter  without subjectivity. One can carry out objectively, that is impartially,  research whose object cannot be conceived and constructed without being  related to a positive and negative qualification, whose object is not so much a  fact as a value. </p><div id="pagenum"><p>155</p></div><p id="page">SECTION II  NEW REFLECTIONS ON THE NORMAL AND  THE PATHOLOGICAL  (1963-1966) </p><div id="pagenum"><p>156</p></div><p id="page">TWENTY YEARS LATER ...  In 1943 as teacher [charge d'enseignement] in the Faculty of Letters at  Strasbourg in Clermont Ferrand, I gave a course on Norms and the Normal.  At the same time I was writing my doctoral thesis in medicine, which I de­ fended in July of the same year, before the Strasbourg Faculty of Medicine.  In 1963 as professor in the Faculty of Letters and Social Sciences at Paris I  gave a course on the same subject: twenty years later I wanted to measure  myself against the same difficulties by other means.  It was out of the question simply to reexamine the same questions. Certain  propositions, which I tried to support soundly in my Essay because of their - perhaps only apparent -paradoxical character seemed to me after that to be  taken for granted: less because of the force of my own argumentation than  because of the ingenuity of some readers who were clever in finding antece­ dents unknown to me. One young colleague,l a fine Kant specialist studying  the Kantian philosophy in its relations with eighteenth century biology and  medicine, pointed out a text to me of the kind that generates at once the  satisfaction of a great meeting and the embarassment at an ignorance under  whose shelter one believed one was able to claim for oneself a bit of original­ ity. Kant noted, more than likely around 1798:  The need to unravel the skein of politics by starting from the subjects' duties rather than  the citizens' rights has recently been stressed.. Likewise it is diseases which have stimu­ lated physiology; and it is not physiology but pathology and clinical practice which gave  medicine its start. The reason is that as a matter of fact well-being is not felt, for it is the  simple awareness of living, and only its impediment provokes the force ofresistance. It  is no wonder then that Brown begins by classifying diseases. [Kant, Werke, Akadernie  Ausgabe, 152, Anthropologie, in the 'Handschriftlicher Nachlass', p. 964].  Because of this it seemed superfluous to look for new justifications for the  thesis which presents clinical practice and pathology as the breeding ground  in which physiology is rooted, and as the path on which the human experi­ ence of disease conveys the concept of normal right to the heart of the phy­ siologist's problematic. To this was added the fact that new readings of Claude  Bernard, stimulated and clarified by the 1947 publication of the Principes de  medecin~ experimentale, necessarily softened the rigor of the judgment I first  passed on his idea of the relations between physiology and pathology,2 and  141 </p><div id="pagenum"><p>157</p></div><p id="page">142 NEW REFLECTIONS  made me more sensitive to the fact that Bernard did not ignore the need for  clinical experience to precede laboratory experimentation.  If I had to deal with beginners, the fust thing I would tell them is go to the hospital; t~t  is the fust thing to get acquainted with. For how would one analyze diseases, which one  didn't know, by means of experimentation? Therefore I am not saying substitute the  laboratory for the hospital. I am saying the opposite: go to the hospital fust, but this is  not enough to attain scientific or experimental medicine; we must go to the laboratory  afterwards to analyze experimentally what clinical observation has led us to record. I  cannot imagine why this objection is made to me for I have indeed often said and re­ peated that medicine must always begin with a clinical observation (see Introduction,  p. 242) and it is in this way that it began in ancient times. 3  Conversely, having given Bernard his due, which I had in part contested, I had  to show myself, as I also did, rather less generous with regard to Leriche. 4  For all these reasons, my 1963 course explored the subject by tracing  different paths from those of 1943. Other reading stimulated my reflections  in other ways. It is not just a matter of reading works which have appeared in  the interim. It is also a matter of readings which I could have or had done at  the time. Th~ bibliography of a subject always has to be redone, even retro­ spectively. One will understand this by comparing even here the 1966 bibliog­ raphy with that of 1943.  But the two courses on Norms and the Normal by extension went beyond  the subject of medical philosophy dealt with by the Essay which I still intend  to reexamine in the pages that follow. The meaning of the concepts of norm  and normal in the social sciences, sociology, ethnology, economics, involve  research which in the end -whether it deals with social types, criteria of  maladjustment to the group, consumer needs and 'behavior, preference sys­ tems -tends toward the question of the relations between normality and  generality. If at the start I borrow some elements of analysis from the lec­ tures, in which I examined some aspects of this question in my own way, it is  only to clarify the specific meaning of vital norms by comparing them with  social norms. It is with the organism in view that I am allowing myself some  forays into society.  Can I confess that reading studies written after my 1943 thesis with a simi­ lar objective has not convinced me that I myself posed the problem badly at  that time? All those who, like me, aimed at determining the meaning of the  concept of normal have experienced the same difficulty and, faced with the  term's polysemous character, had no other resource than to determine deci­ sively the meaning which seemed to them most adequate for the theoretical  or practical project which called up a semantic delimitation. This amounts to </p><div id="pagenum"><p>158</p></div><p id="page">TWENTY YEARS LATER ... 143  saying that those who themselves tried most rigorously to give 'normal' only  the value of a fact have simply valorized the fact of their need for a limited  meaning. Today then, as twenty years ago, I am still running the risk of trying  to establish the fundamental meaning of the normal by means of a philosoph­ ical analysis of life understood as activity of opposition to inertia and in­ difference. life tries to win against death in all the senses of the word to win,  foremost in the sense of winning in gambling. life gambles against growing  entropy. </p><div id="pagenum"><p>159</p></div><p id="page">I  FROM THE SOCIAL TO THE VITAL  In the Critique of Pure Reason ([in the 3rd section of the] transcendental  methodology: architectonic of pure reason), Kant distinguishes concepts,  according to their sphere of origin and validity, into scholastic and cosmic,  the latter serving as the foundation for the former.  We could say of the two concepts of Norm and Normal that the first is  scholastic while the second is cosmic or popular. It is possible for the normal  to be a category of popular judgment because their social situation is keenly,  though confusedly, felt by the people as not being in line, not 'right' (droite).  But the very term 'normal' has passed into popular language and has been  naturalized there starting with the specific vocabularies of two institutions,  the pedagogical institution and the hospital whose reforms, at least in France,  coincided under the effect of the same cause, the French Revolution. 'Normal'  is the term used by the nineteenth century to designate the scholastic proto­ type and the state of organic health. The reform of medicine as theory, itself  rests on the reform of medicine as practice: in France as also in Austria it is  closely tied to hospital reform. like pedagogical reform, hospital reform ex­ presses a demand for rationalization which also appears in politics, as it  appears in the economy, under the effect of nascent industrial mechanization,  and which fincally ends up in what has since been called normalization.  Just as a normal school is a school where teaching is taught, that is, where  pedagogical methods are set up experimentally, so a normal medicine dropper  is one which is calibrated to divide one gram of distilled water into twenty  free flowing drops so that the pharmaco-dynamic power of a substance in  solution can be graduated according to a medical prescription. Again, among  the 21 railway gauges used long ago and not so long ago, a normal track is one  defined by the 1.44 meter gauge between the insides of the rails, that is, that  track which, at a given moment of European industrial and economic history,  seemed to correspond to the best compromise sought among several initially  conflicting requirements related to mechanics, fuel, trade, the military, and  politics. Likewise, for the physiologist, man's normal weight, bearing in mind  sex, age, and height, is the weight "corresponding to the greatest predictable  longevity". s  In the first three of these examples, the normal seems to be the effect of a  145 </p><div id="pagenum"><p>160</p></div><p id="page">146 NEW REFLECTIONS  choice and a decision external to the object so qualified, while in the fourth,  the term of reference and qualification clearly appears as intrinsic to the  object, if it is true that an individual organism's life span is a specific constant  where health is maintained.  But when we think about it carefully, the normalization of the technical  means of education, health, transportation for people and goods, expresses  collective demands which, taken as a whole, even in the absence of an act of  awareness [prise de conscience] on the part of individuals, in a given historical  society, defines its way of referring its structure, or perhaps its structures, to  what it considers its own good.  In any case the property of an object or fact, called normal in reference to  an external or immanent norm, is the ability to be considered, in its turn, as  the reference for objects or facts which have yet to be in a position to be called  such. The normal is then at once the extension and the exhibition of the  norm. It increases the rule at the same time that it points it out. It asks for  everything outside, beSide, and against it that still escapes it. A norm draws  its meaning, function, and value from the fact of the existence, outside itself,  of what does not meet the requirement it serves.  The normal is not a static or peaceful, but a dynamic and polemical con­ cept. Gaston Bachelard, who was very preoccupied with values in their cosmic  or popular form and in valorization following the axes of the imagination, has  rightly perceived that every value must be earned against an anti-value. It is  he who writes: "The will to cleanse requires an adversary its size".6 When we  know that norma is the Latin word for T -square and that normalis means  perpendicular, we know almost all that must be known about the area in  which the meaning of the terms 'norm' and 'normal' originated, which have  been taken into a great variety of other areas. A norm, or rule, is what can be  used to right, to square, to straighten. To set a norm (normer), to normalize,  is to impose a requirement on an existence, a given whose variety, disparity,  with regard to the requirement, present themselves as a hostile, even more  than an unknown, indeterminant. It is, in effect, a polemical concept which  negatively qualifies the sector of the given which does not enter into its exten­ sion while it depends on its comprehension. The concept of right, depending  on whether it is a matter of geometry, morality, or technology, qualifies what  offers resistance to its application of twisted, crooked, or awkward.'  The reason for the polemical final purpose and usage of the concept of  norm must be sought, as far as we are concerned, in the essence of the normal­ abnormal relationship. It is not a question of a relationship of contradiction  and externality but one of inversion and polarity. The norm, by devaluing </p><div id="pagenum"><p>161</p></div><p id="page">FROM THE SOCIAL TO THE VITAL 147  everything that the reference to it prohibits from being considered normal,  creates on its own the possibility of an inversion of terms. A norm offers  itself as a possible mode of unifying diversity, resolving a difference, settling  a disagreement. But to offer oneself is not to impose oneself. Unlike a law of  nature, a norm does not necessitate its effect. That is to say, a norm has no  significance as norm pure and simple. Because we are dealing with possibility  only, that possibility of reference and regulation which the norm offers leaves  room for another possibility, which can only be its opposite. A norm is in  effect the possibility of a reference only when it has been established or  chosen as the expression of a preference and as the instrument of a will to  substitute a satisfying state of affairs for a disappointing one. Every prefer­ ence for a possible order is accompanied, most often implicitly, by the aver­ sion for the opposite possible order. That which diverges from the preferable  in a given area of evaluation is not the indifferent but the repulsive or more  exactly, the repulsed, the detestable. It is well understood that a gastronomi­ cal norm does not enter into a relation of axiological opposition with a logical  norm. On the other hand, the logical norm in which the true prevails over the  false can be inverted into a norm where the false prevails over the true, as the  ethical norm, where sincerity prevails over duplicity, can be inverted into a  norm where duplicity prevails over sincerity. Yet the inversion of a logical  norm does not yield a logical, but perhaps an aesthetic norm, as the inversion  of an ethical norm does not yield an ethical, but perhaps a political one. In  short, norms, whether in some impliCit or explicit form, refer the real to  values, express discriminations of qualities in conformity with the polar oppo­ sition of a positive and a negative. This polarity of the experience of normal­ ization, a specifically anthropological or cultural experience -if it is true that  by nature, only an ideal of normality without normalization must be under­ stood -builds into the relationship of the norm to its area of application the  normal priority of infraction.  In anthropoligical experience a norm cannot be original. Rule begins to be  rule only in making rules and this function of correction arises from infrac­ tion itself. A golden age, a paradise, are the mythical representations of an  existence which initially meets its demands, of a mode of life whose regularity  owes nothing to the establishment of rules, of a state of guiltlessness in the  absence of the interdict that ignorance of the law is no excuse. These two  myths proceed from an illusion of retroactivity according to which original  good is later evil kept in control. The absence of rules goes hand in hand with  the absence of technical skills. Golden age man, and paradasiacal man, spon­ taneously enjoy the fruits of a nature which is uncultivated, unprompted, </p><div id="pagenum"><p>162</p></div><p id="page">148 NEW REFLECTIONS  unforced, unreclaimed. Neither work nor culture, such is the desire of com­ plete regression. This formulation in negative terms of an experience con­ sonant with the norm without the norm having had to show itself in and by its  function, this really naive dream of regularity in the absence of rule, signifies  essentially that the concept of normal is itself normative, it serves as a norm  even for the universe of mythical discourse which tells the story of its absence.  This explains why, in many mythologies, the advent of the golden age marks  the end of a chaos. As Gaston Bachelard said: "Multiplicity is agitation. In  literature there is not one immobile chaos" lop. cit., p. 59]. In Ovid's Meta­ morphoses the earth of chaos does not bear fruit, the sea of chaos is not navi­ gable, forms do not remain identical to themselves. The initial indetermination  is later denied determination. The instability of things has as its correlative  the impotence of man. The image of chaos is that of a denied regularity, as  that of the golden age is that of wild [sauvage] reguhirity. Chaos and golden  age are the mythical terms of the fundamental normative relation, terms so  related that neither of the two can keep from turning into the other. The role  of chaos is to summon up, to provoke its interruption and to become an  order. Inversely the order of the golden age cannot last because wild regularity  is mediocrity; the satisfactions there are modest -aurea mediocritas -be­ cause they are not a victory gained over the obstacle of measure. Where a rule  is obeyed without awareness of a possible transcendence, all enjoyment is  simple. But can one simply enjoy the value of the rule itself? In order to truly  enjoy the value of the rule, the value of regulation, the value of valorization,  the rule must be subjected to the test of dispute. It is not just the exception  which proves the rule as rule, it is the infraction which provides it with the  occasion to be rule by making rules. In this sense the infraction is not the  origin of the rule but the origin of regulation. It is in the nature of the norma­ tive that its beginning lies in its infraction. To use a Kantian expression, we  would propose that the condition of the possibility of rules is but one with  the condition of the possibility of the experience of rules. In a situation of  irregularity, the experience of rules puts the regulatory function of rules to  the test.  What eighteenth century philosophers called the state of nature is the  supposedly rational equivalent of the golden age. We must recognize with  Levi-Strauss that Rousseau, unlike Diderot, never thought that the state of  nature was a historical origin for humanity broUght to the ethnographer's  attention by the grographer's exploration. 8 For his part 9 Jean Starobinski has  shown successfully that the state of nature described by Rousseau is the  portrayal of spontaneous equilibrium between the world and the values of </p><div id="pagenum"><p>163</p></div><p id="page">FROM THE SOCIAL TO THE VITAL 149  desire, a state of prehistoric haphazardness in the absolute sense of the tenn,  since it is from its irremediable disintegration that history flows as from a  source. Strictly speaking, then, there is no grammatical tense adequate for a  discussion of a human experience which has been nonnalized without the  representation, in the consciousness, of norms linked to the temptation to  oppose their exercise. For, either the adequation of fact and law is unper­ ceived and the state of nature is a state of unawareness of which no event can  explain that from it stems the occasion of a grasp of consciousness; or, the  adequation is perceived and the state of nature is a state of innocence. But  this state cannot exist for itself and be a state at the same time, that is, a  static disposition. No one innocently knows that he is innocent since being  aware of adequation to the rule means being aware of the reasons for the rule  which amount to the need for the rule. It is appropriate to contrast to the  overly exploited Socratic maxim that no knowing man is evil, the opposite  maxim that no one is good who is aware of being so. Similarly no one is  healthy who knows that he is so. Kant's words: "Well-being is not felt for it is  the simple consciousness of living"lO are echoed by Leriche's definition:  "Health is life in the silence of the organs". But it is in the rage of guilt as in  the clamor of suffering that innocence and health arise as the tenns of a  regression as impossible as it is sought after.  The abnormal, as ab-normal, comes after the definition of the normal, it is  its logical negation. However, it is the historical anteriority of the future  abnormal which gives rise to a normative intention. The nonnal is the effect  obtained by the execution of the normative project, it is the norm exhibited  in the fact. In the relationship of the fact there is then a relationship of  exclusion between the nonnal and the abnonnal. But this negation is subordi­ nated to the operation of negation, to the correction summoned up by the  abnonnality. Consequently it is not paradoxical to say that the abnormal,  while logically second, is existentially first.  The Latin word norma which, etymologically speaking, bears the weight of  the initial meaning of the tenns 'nonns' and 'nonnal', is the equivalent of the  Greek opOo~. Orthography [French, orthographe, but long ago orthographie] ,  orthodoxy, orthopedics, are normative concepts prematurely. If the concept  of orthology is less familiar, at least it is not altogether useless to know that  Plato guaranteed itll and the word is found, without a reference citation,  in. littre's Dictionnaire de la langue {ranr;aise. Orthology is grammar in the  sense given it by Latin and medieval writers, that is, the regulation of lan­ guage usage. </p><div id="pagenum"><p>164</p></div><p id="page">150 NEW REFLECTIONS  If it is true that the experience of normalization is a specifically anthropo­ logical or cultural experience, it can seem normal that language has proposed  one of its prime fields for this experience. Grammar furnishes prime material  for reflection on norms. When Francis I in the edict ofVillers-Cotteret ordains  that all judicial acts of the kingdom be drawn up in French, we are dealing  with an imperativeP But a norm is not an imperative to do something under  pain of juridical sanctions. When the grammarians of the same era undertook  to fix the usage of the French language, it was a question of norms, of deter­ mining the reference, and of defining mistakes in terms of divergence, differ­ ence. The reference is borrowed from usage. In the middle of the seventeenth  century this is Vaugelas's thesis: "Usage is that to which we must subject  ourselves entirely in our language"P Vaugelas's works turn up in the wake of  works of the Academic [ran£;aise which was founded precisely to embellish  the language. In fact in the seventeenth century the grammatical norm was  the usage of cultured, bourgeois Parisians, so that this norm reflects a political  norm: administrative centralization for the benefit of royal power. In terms  of normalization there is no difference between the birth of grammar in  France in the seventeenth century and the establishment of the metric system  at the end of the eighteenth. Richelieu, the members of the National Conven­ tion, and Napoleon Bonaparte are the successive instruments of a same collec­ tive demand. It began with grammatical norms and ended with morphological  norms of men and horses for national defense,14 passing through industrial  and sanitary norms.  Defining industrial norms assumes a unity of plan, direction of work,  stated purpose of material constructed. The article on 'Gun-carriage' in the  Encyclopedie of Diderot and d' Alembert, revised by the Royal Artillery  Corps, admirably sets forth the motifs of the normalization of work in arse­ nals. In it we see how the confusion of efforts, the detail of proportions, the  difficulty and slowness of replacements, useless expense, are remedied. The  standardization of designs of pieces and dimension tables, the imposition of  patterns and models have as their consequence the precision of separate pro­ ducts and the regularity of assembly. The 'Gun-carriage' article contains  almost all the concepts used in a modern treatise on normalization except the  term norm. Here we have the thing without the word.  The definition of sanitary norms assumes that, from the political point of  view, attention is paid to populations' health considered statistically, to the  healthiness of conditions of existence, and to the uniform dissemination of  preventive and curative treatments perfected by medicine. In Austria Maria  Theresa and Joseph II conferred legal status on public health institutions by </p><div id="pagenum"><p>165</p></div><p id="page">FROM THE SOCIAL TO THE VITAL 151  creating an Imperial Health Commission (Sanitiits-Hofdeputation, 1753)  and by promulgating a Haupt Medizinal Ordnung, replaced in 1770 by the  Sanitiits-normativ, an act with 40 regulations related to medicine, veterinary  art, pharmacy, the training of surgeons, demographical and medical statistics.  With respect to norm and normalization here we have the word with the  thing.  In both of these examples the norm is what determines the normal starting  from a normative decision. As we are going to see, such a decision regarding  this or that norm is understood only within the context of other norms. At a  given moment the experience of normalization cannot be broken down, at  least not into projects. Pierre Guiraud clearly perceived this in the case of  grammar when he wrote:  Richelieu's founding of the Academie franqaise in 1635 fit into a general policy of cen­ tralization of which the Revolution, the Empire, and the Republic are the heirs .... It  would not be absurd to think that the bourgeoisie annexed the language at the same time  that it seized the instruments of production.' 5  It could be said in another way by trying to substitute an equivalent for the  Marxist concept of the ascending class. Between 1759, when the word 'nor­ mal' appeared, and 1834 when the word 'normalized' appeared, a normative  class had won the power to identify - a beautiful example of ideological  illusion -the function of social norms, whose content it determined, with  the use that that class made of them.  That the normative intention in a given society in a given era cannot be  broken down is apparent when we examine the relations between technologi­ cal and juridical norms. In the rigorous and present meaning of the term,  technological normalization consists in the choice and determination of  material, the form and dimensions of an object whose characteristics from  then on become necessary for consistent manufacture. The division of labor  constrains businessmen to a homogeneity of norms at the heart of a technical­ economic complex whose dimensions are constantly evolving on a national or  international scale. But technology develops within a society's economy. A  demand to simplify can appear urgent from the technological point of view  but it can seem premature from the industrial and economic point of view as  far as the possibilities of the moment and the immediate future are con­ cerned. The logic of technology and the interests of the economy must come  to terms. Moreover, in another respect, technological normalization must be­ ware of an excess of rigidity. What is manufactured must finally be consumed.  Certainly the logic of normalization can be pushed as far as the normalization </p><div id="pagenum"><p>166</p></div><p id="page">152 NEW REFLECTIONS  of needs by means of the presuasion of advertising. For all that, should the  question be settled as to whether need is an object of possible normalization  or the subject obliged to invent norms? Assuming that the first of these two  propositions is true, normalization must provide for needs, as it does for  objects characterized by norms, margins for divergence, but here without  quantification. The relation of technology to consumption introduces into  the unification of methods, models, procedures, and proofs of qualification,  a relative flexibility, evoked furthermore by the term 'normalization', which  was preferred in France in 1930 to 'standardization', to designate the admin­ istrative organism responsible for enterprise on a national scale. 16 The con­ cept of normalization excludes that of immutability, includes the anticipation  of a possible flexibility. So we see how a technological norm gradually reflects  an idea of society and its hierarchy of values, how a decision to normalize as­ sumes the representation of a possible whole of correlative, complementary, or  compensatory decisions. This whole must be finished in advance, finished if  not closed. The representation of this totality of reciprocally relative norms is  planning. Strictly speaking the unity of a Plan would be the unity of a unique  thought. A bureaucratic and technocratic myth, the Plan is the modern dress  of the idea of Providence. As it is very clear that a meeting of delegates and a  gathering of machines are hard put to achieve a unity of thought, it must be  admitted that we would hesitate to say of the Plan what La Fontaine said of  Providence, that it knows what we need better than we do. 17 Nevertheless - and without ignoring the fact that it has been possible to present normaliza­ tion and planning as closely connected to a war economy or the economy of  totalitarian regimes -we must see above all in planning endeavors the attempts  to constitute organs through which a society could estimate, foresee, and  assume its needs instead of being reduced to recording and stating them in  terms of accounts and balance-sheets. So that what is denounced, under the  name of rationalization -the bogy complacently waved by the champions of  liberalism, the economic variety of the cult of nature -as a mechanization  of social life, perhaps expresses, on the contrary, the need, obscurely felt by  society, to become the organic subject of needs recognized as such.  It is easy to understand how technological activity and its normalization,  in terms of their relation to the economy, are related to the juridical order. A  law of industrial property, juridical protection of patents or registered pat­ terns, exists. To normalize a registered pattern is to proceed to industrial  expropriation. The requirement of national defense is the reason invoked by  many States to introduce such provisions into legislation. The universe of  technological norms opens onto the universe of juridical norms. An expro-</p><div id="pagenum"><p>167</p></div><p id="page">FROM THE SOCIAL TO THE VITAL 153  priation is carried out according to the norms of law. The magistrates who  decide, the bailiffs responsible for carrying out the sentence, are persons iden­ tified with their function by virtue of norms, installed in their function with  the delegation of competence. Here the normal descends from a higher norm  through hierarchized delegation. In his Reine Rechtslehre (Leipzig, F.  Deuticke, 1934, 2nd revised and enlarged edition, 1960; translated as Pure  Theory of Law, 2nd revised and enlarged edition, Berkeley, University of  California Press, 1967), Ke1sen maintains that the validity of a juridical norm  depends on its insertion in a coherent system, an order of hierarchized norms,  drawing their binding power from their direct or indirect reference to a fun­ damental norm. But there are different juridical orders because there are  several fundamental, irreducible norms. If it has been possible to contrast this  philosophy of law with its powerlessness to absorb political fact into juridical  fact, as it claims to do, at least its merit in having brought to light the rela­ tivity of juridical norms hierarchized in a coherent order has been generally  recognized. So that one of Kelsen's most resolute critics can write: "The law  is the system of conventions and norms destined to orient all behavior inside  a group in a well-defined manner" .18 Even while recognizing that the law,  private as well as public, has no source other than a political one, we can  admit that the opportunity to legislate is given to the legislative power by a  multiplicity of customs which must be institutionalized by that power into a  virtual juridical whole. Even in the absence of the concept of juridical order,  dear to Kelsen, the relativity of juridical norms can be justified. This relativity  can be more or less strict. There exists a tolerance for non-relativity which  does not mean a gap in relativity. In fact the norm of norms remains conver­ gence. How could it be otherwise if law "is only the regulation of social  activity?" .19  To sum up, starting with the deliberately chosen example of the most arti­ ficial normalization, technological normalization, we can grasp an invariable  characteristic of normality. Norms are relative to each other in a system, at  least potentially. Their co-relativity within a social system tends to make this  system an organization, that is, a unity in itself, if not by itself and for itself.  One philosopher, at least, has noticed and brought to light the organic charac­ ter of moral norms, much as they are first of all social norms. It is Bergson in  Les deux sources de la morale et de la religion ['The Two Sources of Morality  and Religion'] analyzing what he calls "the totality of obligation".  The co-relativity of social norms -technological, economic, juridical -tends  to make their virtual unity an organization. It is not easy to say what the </p><div id="pagenum"><p>168</p></div><p id="page">154 NEW REFLECTIONS  concept of organization is in relation to that of organism, whether we are  dealing with a more general structure than the organism, both more formal  and richer; or whether we are dealing with a model which, relative to the  organism held as a basic type of structure, has been singularized by so many  restrictive conditions that it could have no more consistency than a metaphor.  Let us state first that in a social organization, the rules for adjusting the  parts into a collective which is more or less clear as to its own final purpose - be the parts individuals, groups, or enterprises with a limited objective -are  external to the adjusted multiple. Rules must be represented, learned, remem­ bered, applied, while in a living organism the rules for adjusting the parts  among themselves are immanent, presented without being represented, acting  with neither deliberation nor calculation. Here there is no divergence, no dis­ tance, no delay between rule and regulation. The social order is a set of rules  with which the servants or beneficiaries, in any case, the leaders, must be con­ cerned. The order of life is made of a set of rules lived without problems. 20  The inventor of the term and first concept of sociology, Auguste Comte,  in the lectures of the Cours de philosophie positive, which deal with what he  then called social physics, did not hesitate to use the term 'social organism' to  designate society defined as a consensus of parts coordinated according to  two relations, synergy and sympathy, concepts borrowed from the Hippocra­ tic medical tradition. Organization, organism, system, consensus are used  indifferently by Comte to designate the state of society. 21 As far back as that  period, Comte distinguished between society and power, understanding the  latter concept as the organ and regulator of spontaneous common action,22  an organ distinct but not separate from the social body, a rational, artificial  but not arbitrary organ of the "manifest spontaneous harmony which must  always tend to rule between the whole and the parts of the social system".23  Thus the relationship between society and government is itself a relationship  of co-relation, and the political order appears as the voluntary and artificial  extension "of this natural and involuntary order toward which the various  human societies necessarily and incessantly tend in any respect".24  We must wait for the Systeme de politique positive in order to see Comte  limit the scope of the analogy he accepted in the Cours and to emphasize the  differences which keep one from considering as equivalent the structure of  an organism and the structure of a social organization. In the fifth chapter  ('Theorie positive de l'organisme social') of the Statique sociale (1852),  Comte insists on the fact that the composite nature of the collective organism  differs profoundly from the indivisible constitution of the organism. Though  functionally concurrent, the elements of the social body are capable of a </p><div id="pagenum"><p>169</p></div><p id="page">FROM THE SOCIAL TO THE VITAL 155  separate existence. In this respect the social organism does contain some  mechanistic characteristics. In the same respect, moreover, "the collective  organism, because of its composite nature, possesses to a high degree the  important aptitude, which the individual organism shows only in a rudimen­ tary state, namely the ability to acquire new, even essential organs" .25 Be­ cause of this, regulation, the integration of successively related parts into a  whole, is a specific social need. To regulate the life of a society, family, or  city is to introduce into a society -at once more general and more noble  because closer to the only concrete social reality -Humanity or Great-Being.  Social regulation is religion and positive religion is philosophy, spiritual  power, the general art of man's action on himself. This function of social  regulation must have a distinct organ, the priest, whose temporal power is  merely a subordinate means. Socially speaking, to regulate is to cause the  spirit of the whole to prevail. So that the entire social organism, if it is smaller  than the Great-Being, is regulated from without and from above. The regula­ tor is subsequent to what it regulates: "In effect only preexisting powers can  be regulated, except instances of metaphysical illusion where we believe we  create them to the extent that we define them".26  We shall say otherwise -certainly not better, probably less well- namely  that a society is both machine and organism. It would be only a machine if  the collective's ends could not only be strictly planned but also executed in  conformity with a program. In this respect certain contemporary societies  with a socialist form of economy tend perhaps toward an automatic mode of  functioning. But it must be acknowledged that this tendency still encounters  obstacles in facts, and not just in the ill-will of skeptical performers, which  oblige the organizers to summon up their resources for improvisation. It can  even be asked whether any society whatsoever is capable of both clearsighted­ ness in determining its purposes and efficiency in utilizing its means. In any  case the fact that one of the tasks of the entire social organization consists in  its informing itself as to its possible purposes -with the exception of archaic  and so-called primitive societies where purpose is furnished in rite and tradi­ tion just as the behavior of the animal organism is provided by an innate  model -seems to show clearly that, strictly speaking, it has no intrinsic  finality. In the case of society, regulation is a need in search of its organ and  its norms of exercise.  On the other hand, in the case of the organism the fact of need expresses  the existence of a regulatory apparatus. The need for food, energy, move­ ment, and rest requires, as a condition of its appearance in the form of  anxiety and the act of searching, the reference of the organism, in a state of </p><div id="pagenum"><p>170</p></div><p id="page">156 NEW REFLECTIONS  given fact, to an optimum state of functioning, determined in the form of a  constant. An organic regulation or a homeostasis assures first of all the return  to the constant when, because of variations in its relation to the environment,  the organism diverges from it. Just as need has as its center the organism  taken in its entirety, even though it manifests itself and is satisfied by means  of one apparatus, so its regulation expresses the integration of parts within  the whole. though it operates by means of one nervous and endocrine system.  This is the reason why, strictly speaking, there is no distance between organs  within the organism, no externality of parts. The knowledge the anatomist  gains from an organism is a kind of display in extensiveness. But the organism  itself does not live in the spatial mode by which it is perceived. The life of a  living being is, for each of its .elements, the immediacy of the co-presence of  all.  The phenomena of social organization are like a mimicry of vital organiza­ tion in the sense that Aristotle says that art imitates nature. Here to imitate  does not mean to copy but to tend to rediscover the sense of a production.  Social organization is, above all, the invention of organs -organs to look for  and receive information, organs to calculate and even make decisions. In the  still rather summarily rational form that it takes in contemporary industrial  societies, normalization summons up planning which, in its turn, requires the  establishment of statistics of all kinds and their utilization through compu­ ters. Provided that it is possible to explain -other than metaphorically -the  functioning of a circuit of cortical neurons using the functioning of an elec­ tronic analyzer in transistor form as a model, it is tempting, if not legitimate,  today to attribute some, perhaps the less intellectual functions for which the  human brain is the organ, to the computers in the technico-economic organi­ zations they serve. As for the assimilation of social information by means of  statistics being analogous to the assimilation of vital information by means of  sense receptors, to our knowledge it is older. It was Gabriel Tarde, who, in  1890 in Les lois de I 'imitation , was the first to attempt it.27 According to him  statistics is the summation of identical social elements. The spreading of its  results tends to yield its contemporary 'intelligence' about the social fact in  the process of being realized. We can imagine, then, a statistical department  and its role as a social sense organ although for the moment, says Tarde, it is  only a kind of embryonic eye. It must be noted that the analogy proposed by  Tarde rests on the conception that physiological psychology had at that time  of the function of a sense receptor, like the eye or ear, according to which  sensible qualities such as color or sound synthesize the components of a stim­ ulant into one specific unit which the physicist counts in a multiplicity of </p><div id="pagenum"><p>171</p></div><p id="page">FROM THE SOCIAL TO THE VITAL 157  vibrations. So that Tarde could write that "our senses, each one separately and  from its special point of view, makes our statistics of the external universe".  But the difference between the social machinery for receiving and ela­ borating information, on the one hand, and the living organ on the other, still  persists in that the perfecting of both in the course of human history and the  evolution of life, takes place according to inverse modes. The biological evo­ lution of organisms ha~ proceeded by means of stricter integration of organs  and functions for contact with the environritent and by means of a more  autonomous internalization of the conditions of existence of the organism's  components and the establishment of what Claude Bernard called the 'internal  environment'. Whereas the historical evolution of human societies has consis­ ted in the fact that collectivities less extensive than the species have multiplied  and, as it were, spread their means of action in spatial externality and their  institutions in administrative externality, adding machines to tools, stocks to  reserves, archives to traditions. In society the solution to each new problem  of information and regulation is sought in, if not obtained by, the creation of  organisms or institutions 'parallel' to those whose inadequacy, because of  sclerosis and routine, shows up at a given moment. Society must always solve  a problem without a solution, that of the convergence of parallel solutions.  Faced with this, the living organism establishes itself preCisely as the simple  realization -if not in all SimpliCity -of such a convergence. As Leroi-Gourhan  writes:  Form animal to man everything happens summarily as if brain were added to brain, each  of the latest developed formations involving an increasingly subtle cohesion of all the  earlier forms which continue to play their role. 28  Inversely the same author shows that "all human evolution converges to place  outside of man what in the rest of the animal world corresponds to specific  adaptation" ,29 which amounts to saying that the externalization of the organs  of technology is a uniquely human phenomenon. 30 It is not forbidden to  consider the existence of a distance between social organs, that is, the collec­ tive technical means at man's disposal, as a specific characteristic of human  society. It is to the extent that society is an externality of organs that man  can dispose of it by representation and therefore by choice. So that to pro­ pose the model of the organism for human societies in search of more and  more organization is essentially to dream of a return not even to archaic, but  to animal, societies.  There is hardly need, therefore, to insist now on the fact that social organs,  if they are reciprocally purpose and means in a social whole, do not exist </p><div id="pagenum"><p>172</p></div><p id="page">158 NEW REFLECTIONS  through one another and through the whole by virtue of coordinating causali­ ties. The externality of social machines in the organization is in itself no  different from the externality of parts in a machine.  Social regulation tends toward organic regulation and mimics it without  ceasing for all that to be composed mechanically. In order to identify the  social composition with the social organism in the strict sense of the term, we  should be able to speak of a society's needs and norms as one speaks of an  organism's vital needs and norms, that is, unambiguously. The vital needs and  norms of a lizard or a stickleback in their natural habitat are expressed in the  very fact that these animals are very natural living beings in this habitat. But  it is enough that one individual in any society question the needs and norms  of this society and challenge them - a sign that these needs and norms are  not those of the whole society -in order for us to understand to what extent  social need is not immanent, to what extent the social norm is not internal,  and finally, to what extent the society, seat of restrained dissent or latent  antagonisms, is far from setting itself up as a whole. If the individual poses a  question about the finality of the society, is this not the sign that the society  is a poorly unified set of means, precisely lacking an end with which the col­ lective activity permitted by the structure would identify? To support this we  could invoke the analyses of ethnographers who are sensitive to the diversity  of systems of cultural norms. Levi-Strauss says:  We then discover that no society is fundamentally good, but that none is absolutely bad;  they all offer their members certain advantages, with the proviso that there is invariably  a residue of evil, the amount of which seems to remain more or less constant and perhaps  corresponds to a specific inertia in social life resistant to all attempts at organization. 31 </p><div id="pagenum"><p>173</p></div><p id="page">II  ON ORGANIC NORMS IN MAN  As far as health and disease are concerned, and consequently as far as setting  accidents right, correcting disorders, or, as it is popularly said, remedying ills  are concerned, there is a difference between an organism and a society, in  that the therapist of their ills, in the case of the organism, knows in advance  and without hesitation, what normal state to establish, while in the case of  society, he does not know.  G. K. Chesterton, in a small book called What's Wrong with the World,32  denounced the frequent tendency of political writers and reformers to deter­ mine the state of social ill before proposing its remedies, calling it 'medical  error'. The quick, brilliant, ironic refutation of what he calls a sophism rests  on this axiom:  Because, though there may be doubt about the way in which the body broke down,  there is no doubt at all about the shape in which it should be built up again .... Medical  science is content with the normal human body and only seeks to restore it.33  If there is no hesitation about the finality of a medical treatment, this is not  so, says Chesterton, when it comes to social problems. For the determination  of the ill assumes the prior definition of the normal social state and the search  for this definition divides those who devote themselves to it.  The social case is exactly the opposite of the medical case. We do not disagree, like doc­ tors, about the precise nature of the illness, while agreeing about the nature of health. 34  It is social welfare that is discussed in society, which means that what some  consider a downright ill others seek out as health as a matter of course! 35  There is something serious in this humor. To say that "no doctor proposes  t6 produce a new kind of man, with a new arrangement of eyes or limbs", 36 is  to recognize that an organism's norm of life is furnished by the organism  itself, contained in its existence. And it is quite true that no doctor dreams of  promising his patients anything more than a return to the state of vital satis­ faction from which illness hurled them down.  But it happens that there is more humor in reality than in humorists. Just  when Chesterton was praising doctors for accepting the fact that the organism  provides them with the norm for their restorative activity, certain biologists  159 </p><div id="pagenum"><p>174</p></div><p id="page">160 NEW REFLECTIONS  began to conceive of the possibility of applying genetics to transfonn the  nonns of the human race. The first lectures of H. 1. Muller (the geneticist  famous for his experiments with induced mutations) to be concerned with  contemporary man's social and moral obligation to interfere with himself in  order to generally move himself up to a higher intellectual level, that is, in  short, to vulgarize genius by means of eugenics, date from 1910. On the  whole it is not a matter of an individual desire but of a social program whose  initial fate would have seemed to Chesterton the most perfect confirmation  of his paradox. In Out o/the Night,37 Muller proposed a collectivity without  classes and without social inequalities as a social ideal to be realized, where  techniques for preserving seminal fluid and for artificial insemination would  allow women, whom a rational education had made proud to have such an  honor, to bear and raise the children of men of genius, of Lenin or Darwin. 38  Now it is precisely in the Soviet Union, where the book was written, that  Muller's manuscript, sent to high places where it was thought it would please,  was judged severely and the Russian geneticist, who had acted as a go-be­ tween, fell in disgrace.39 A social ideal based on a theory of heredity like  genetics, which establishes the fact of human inequality by creating tech­ niques to correct it, would not be welcome in a classless society.  Without forgetting that genetics offers biologists precisely the possibility  of conceiving and applying a fonnal biology and consequently of transcend­ ing life's empirical forms by creating experimental living beings following  other nonns, we shall agree that up until now a human organism's nonn is its  coincidence with the organism itself, while we wait for the day when it will  coincide with the calculations of a eugenic geneticist.  If social nonns could be perceived as clearly as organic norms, men would be  mad not to confonn to them. As men are not mad and as there are no Wise  Men, social nonns are to be invented and not observed. The concept of wis­ dom was a concept filled with meaning for Greek philosophers because they  conceived of society as a reality of an organic type, having an intrinsic nonn,  its own health, rules of measure, eqUilibrium and compensation, a replication,  and imitation, on the human scale, of the universal law which made a cosmos  of the totality of beings. A contemporary biologist, W. B. Cannon, echoed the  assimilation of juridical concepts with medical concepts in archaic Greek  thought when he entitled the work in which he expounds the theory of  organic regulations -homeostasis -The Wisdom o/the Body.40 To speak of  the wisdom of the body leads one to understand that the living body is in a  permanent state of controlled eqUilibrium, of disequilibrium which is resisted </p><div id="pagenum"><p>175</p></div><p id="page">ON ORGANIC NORMS IN MAN 161  as soon as it begins, of stability maintained against disturbing influences  originating without: it means, in short, that organic life is an order of pre­ carious and threatened functions which are constantly re-established by a  system of regulations. In ascribing a wisdom to the body, Starling and Cannon  repatriated to physiology a concept which medicine had once exported to  politics. Yet Cannon, in his turn, could not help expanding the concept of  homeostasis so that he gave it the power to clarify social phenomena, entitling  his last chapter: 'Relations of Biological and Social Homeostasis'. But the  analysis of these relations is a tissue of commonplaces of liberal sociology and  parliamentary politics concerning the alternation -in which Cannon sees the  effect of a compensation apparatus -between conservatism and reformism.  As if this alternation, far from being the effect of an apparatus which is in­ herent, even in the rudimentary state, to every social structure, were not in  fact the expression of the relative effiCiency of a regime invented to channel  and smother social antagonisms, of a political machine acquired by modern  societies in order to delay, without finally being able to prevent, the trans­ formation of their inconsistencies into crises. In observing industrial age socie­ ties it can be asked whether their actual permanent state is not one of crisis  and whether this is not an unequivocal symptom of the absence of their  power of self-regulation.  The regulations for which Cannon invented the general term homeostasis 41  are similar to those which Claude Bernard had unified under the name of  'constants of the internal environment'. These are norms of organic function­ ing such as the regulation of respiratory movements under the effect of the  rate of carbonic acid dissolved in the blood, thermoregulation in animals with  constant temperature, etc. We know today what Bernard could only suspect,  namely that other forms of regulation must be taken into consideration in  studying organic structures and the origin of these structures. Contemporary  experimental embryology has found its basis problems in the fact of morphol­ ogical regulations which, in the course of embryonic development, conserve  or reestablish the integrity of the specific form and extend their organizing  action in repairing certain mutilations. So that the set of norms, by virtue of  which living beings show themselves as forming a distinct world, can be classed  as norms of constitution, norms of reconstitution, and norms of functioning.  These different norms pose the same problem for biologists, namely their  relation to uncommon cases which, in terms of the normal specific charac­ teristic, show up a distance or a divergence of this or that biological charac­ teristic: height, structure of an organ, chemical composition, behavior, etc.  If the individual organism is the one which, of its own accord, proposes the </p><div id="pagenum"><p>176</p></div><p id="page">162 NEW REFLECTIONS  norm for its restoration, in the case of malformation or accident, what sets up  as norms the specific structure and functions which cannot be grasped by the  individuals other than as they are manifested? Thermoregulation varies from  the rabbit to the stork, from the horse to the camel. But how do we under­ stand the norms peculiar to each species, rabbits, for example, without eras­ ing the slight, fragmentary dissimilarities which give individuals their singu­ larity?  The concept of normal in biology is objectively defined in terms of the  frequency of the characteristic so qualified. For a given species, weight,  height, maturation of instincts for a given age and sex are those which effec­ tively characterize the most numerous groups distinctively formed by indivi­ duals of a natural population made to appear identical by measurement. It  was Quetelet who observed around 1843 that the distribution of human  heights could be represented by the error law established by Gauss, a limiting  form of the binomial law, and who distinguished the two concepts of the  Gaussian average or true average from the arithmetic average, which were at  first identified in the theory of the average man. The distribution of the  results of measurement on either side of the average value guarantees that the  Gaussian average is the true average. The greater the divergences the rarer  they are.  In our Essay (Part Two, 2) we tried to preserve in the concept of norm a  meaning analogous to that of the concept of type which Quetelet had super­ imposed on his theory of the average Man following the discovery of the true  average. It is an analogous meaning, that is, similar in function but different  in foundation. Quetelet defined the regularity expressed by the average, by  the greatest statistical frequency, as the effect of living beings' submission to  laws of divine origin. We had tried to show that the frequency can be explained  in terms of regulations of an order completely different from conformity  to supernatural legislation. We had interpreted frequency as the actual or  virtual criterion of the vitality of an adaptive solution. 42 We have to believe  that our attempt missed its goal since it has been criticized for obSCUrity and  for drawing the unwarranted conclusion that the greatest frequency equals  the best adaptation.43 In fact there is adaptation and adaptation, and the  sense in which it is understood in the objections made to our work is not the  sense we had given it. There is one form of adaptation which is specialization  for a given task in a stable environment, but which is threatened by any  accident which modifies this environment. And there is another form of  adaptation which signifies independence from the constraints of a stable  environment and consequently the ability to overcome the difficulties of </p><div id="pagenum"><p>177</p></div><p id="page">ON ORGANIC NORMS IN MAN 163  living which result from a change in the environment. Now, we have defined a  species' normality in terms of a certain tendency toward variety, "a kind of  insurance against excessive specialization without reversibility, hence without  flexibility, which is ... a successful adaptation". In adaptation perfect or  completed means the beginning of the end of species. At that time we were  inspired by an article of the biologist Albert Vandel, who later developed the  same ideas in his book, L 'homme et l'evolution. 44 May we now be allowed to  resume our analysis.  When the normal is defined in terms of the most frequent, a considerable  obstacle is created to understanding the biological significance of those anoma­ lies which geneticists have given the name of mutations. Indeed, to the extent  to which a mutation in the plant or animal world can be the origin of a new  species, we can see one norm arise from a divergence from another norm. The  norm is the form of divergence maintained by natural selection. It is what  destruction and death concede at random. But we know well that mutations  are more often restrictive than constructive, often superficial when they are  lasting, and when they are considerable, they involve fragility, a decrease in  organic resistance. So that one acknowledges the power of mutations to diver­ sify species into varieties rather than to explain the origin of species.  Strictly speaking, a mutationist theory of the origin of species can define  the normal only as the temporarily viable, But by considering the living only  as the dead with a respite, we ignore the adaptive orientation of the whole of  living beings considered in the continuity of life, and we underestimate this  aspect of evolution which is variation of modes of life for the occupation of  all vacant places.45 There is then one meaning of adaptation which allows one  to distinguish, at a given moment in a species and its mutants, between obso­ lete and progressive living beings. Animality is a form of life characterized by  mobility and predation. In this regard vision is a function which might not be  called useless for mobility in light. A blind and cave-dwelling animal species  can be said to be adapted to the dark and we can imagine its appearance by  means of mutation, starting from a sighted species, and its maintenance by  encountering and occupying an environment which, if not adequate, is at  least not contra-indicated. Nonetheless blindness is considered an anomaly,  not in the sense that it is a rarity but in the sense that it means regression for  the living beings concerned, a placing aside in a dead-end.  It seems to us that one of the signs of the difficulty in explaining the  specific norm in biology in terms of a single encounter of independent causal  series, one biological, the other geographical, is the appearance, in 1954, of  Lerner's concept of genetic homeostasis in population genetics. 46 The study </p><div id="pagenum"><p>178</p></div><p id="page">164 NEW REFLECTIONS  of the arrangements of genes and the appearance of mutant genes in indivi­ duals in natural and experimental populations, combined with the study of  the effects of natural selection, have led to the conclusion that the selective  effect of a gene or of a certain arrangement of genes is not constant, that it  undoubtedly depends on environmental conditions but also on a kind of  pressure exerted on anyone individual by the genetic totality represented by  the population. Even in the case of human diseases, for example Cooley's  anemia, which is common in the Mediterranean, particularly in Sicily and  Sardinia, a selective superiority of heterozygote individuals over homozygotes  has been observed. In animals on breeding farms this superiority can be  measured experimentally. This coincides with the old observations of breeders  concerning the invigoration of breeding lines by cross-breeding. Heterozygotes  are more fertile. In the case of a lethal mutant gene, a het~rozygote enjoys a  selective advantage in relation not only to the mutant homozygote but also to  the normal homozygote -whence the concept of genetic homeostasis. To the  extent to which the survival of a population is favored by the frequency of  heterozygotes, the proportional relation between fertility and heterozygosis  can be considered a regulation. According to J. B. S. Haldane the same is true  for a species' resistance to certain parasites. A biochemical mutation can ob­ tain a greater capacity for resistance for the mutant. The individual biochemi­ cal difference at the heart of a species makes it more fit to survive, at the  cost of alterations which morphologically and physiologically express the  effects of natural selection. Unlike humanity which, according to Marx, poses  only problems which it can solve, life multiplies beforehand the solutions to  problems of adaptation which could present themselves.47  To summarize, the reading and reflecting which we have been able to do  since the 1943 publication of our Essay have not led us to put in question the  interpretation proposed then for the biological foundation of the original  concepts of biometry.  It does not seem to us that we must profoundly modify our analysis of the  relations between the determination of statistical norms and the evalutation  of the normality or abnormality of this or that individual divergence. In the  EssfI)' we relied on the studies of Andre Mayer and Henri Laugier. Among the  numerous articles published since on the same subject, two have claimed our  attention.  The first belongs to A. C. Ivy: 'What is Normal or Normality?, (1944).48  The author distinguishes four meanings of the concept of normal:  (1) coincidence between an organic fact and an ideal which decides the </p><div id="pagenum"><p>179</p></div><p id="page">ON ORGANIC NORMS IN MAN 165  lower or upper limit of certain demands;  (2) the presence in an individual of characteristics (structure, function,  chemical composition) whose measure is conventionally determined by the  central value of a group which is homogeneous in terms of age, sex, etc.;  (3) an individual's situation in terms of the average for each characteris­ tic considered, when the distribution curve has been constructed, the diver­ gence type calculated, and the number of divergence types determined;  (4) the awareness of the absence of handicaps.  The use of the concept 'normal' demands that one specify first the mean­ ing by which one understands it. For his part, the author considers only  numbers 3 and 4, subordinating the latter to the former. He applies himself  to showing how desirable it is to establish the typical deviation of measure­ ment values of structure, functions, or biochemical components in a large  number of subjects, especially when the results deviate strongly, and to con­ sider as normal the values represented by 68.26% of an examined population,  that is, the values corresponding to the average plus or minus a standard  deviation. It is the subjects whose values fall outside the 68% who pose diffi­ cult evaluation problems in terms of their relation to the norm. For example:  the temperature of 10,000 students, who are asked to say whether they feel  feverish or not, is taken, the distribution of the temperatures is constructed,  and for each group with the same temperature the correlation between the  number of individuals and the number of subjects who say they are feverish,  is calculated. The closer the correlation is to 1, the greater the chances are  that the subject, because of an infection, is in a pathological state. Out of 50  subjects with a temperature of 100 FO, there is only a 14% chance for a  normal subject from the subjective point of view (Le., one who did not feel  feverish) to be a normal subject from the bacteriological point of view.  The interest of Ivy's study lies less in the information from classical statis­ tics than in the simplicity with which the author acknowledges the difficulties  of the coincidence of concepts such as the physiological normal and the sta­ tistical normal. The state of physiological plenitude ("the healthful condition"  [in Ivy's work)) is defined as a state of equilibrium of functions that are so  integrated that they gain for the subject a large measure of security, a capac­ ity for resistance in a critical situation or a situation of force. The normal  state of a function is that of not interfering with others. But can it not be  objected to these propositions that most functions, because of their integra­ tion, do interfere. If we must understand that a function is normal insofar as  it does not lead another to abnormality, hasn't the question been shifted? In  any case the comparison of these phYSiological concepts and the concept of </p><div id="pagenum"><p>180</p></div><p id="page">166 NEW REFLECTIONS  nonn statistically defined -the state of 68% of subjects in a homogeneous  group -shows up the inability of the statistically defined nonn to resolve a  concrete problem of pathology. The fact that an old man exhibits functions  included in the 68% corresponding to his age is not sufficient to qualify him  as nonnal to the extent that the physiological nonnal is defined in tenns of a  margin of security in the exercise of functions. Aging is expressed, in effect,  by the reduction of this margin. Finally an analysis such as Ivy's, starting  from other examples, wants to confinn the inadequacy, often recognized  before him, of the statistical point of view each time it must be decided as to  what is normal or not for a given individual.  The necessity to rectify the concept of the statistical nonnal and to make  it flexible in response to the physiologist's experience based on the variability  of functions is also brought to light in an article of 1947 by John A. Ryle,  'The Meaning of Nonnal'.49 The author, a professor of social medicine at  Oxford, is interested first in establishing that certain individual divergences, in  relation to physiological nonns, are not, for all that, pathological indicators.  It is nonnal for physiological variability to exist, it is necessary for adaptation  and hence survival. The author examined 100 students in good health, free of  dyspepsia, in whom he took measurements of gastric acidity. He ascertained  that 10% showed what could be considered pathological hyperchlorhydria  such as is observed in the case of duodenal ulcer, and that 4% showed total  achlorhydria, a symptom considered until then as indicative of progressive  perriicious anemia. The author thinks that all measurable physiological activi­ ties show themselves susceptible of an analogous variability, that they can be  represented by the Gaussian curve and that, for the needs of medicine, the  nonnal must be included between the limits determined by a standard devia­ tion on both sides of the median. But there is no clear dividing line between  innate variations compatible with health, and acquired variations which are  the symptoms of a disease. If really necessary, one can think that an extreme  physiological divergence in tenns of the average constitutes or contributes to  constituting a predisposition to this or that pathological accident.  John A. Ryle lists the medical activities, for which the concept of 'normal  clearly understood' corresponds to a need, as follows:  (1) definition of the pathological;  (2) definition of the functional levels to aim for in treatment or re- education;  (3) the choice of personnel employed in industry;  (4) tracking down predispositions to disease.  Let us note, for it is not unimportant, that the last three needs of this list </p><div id="pagenum"><p>181</p></div><p id="page">ON ORGANIC NORMS IN MAN 167  concern criteria of expertise, capacity, incapacity, mortality risk.  Finally Ryle distinguishes two kinds of variations relative to the norm,  with regard to which it may be that one is to decide abnormality in view of  certain resolutions to be taken of a practical order: variations affecting the  same individual according to time; variations, at a given moment, from one  individual to another in the species. These two kinds of variations are essen­ tial for survival. Adaptability depends on variability. But the study of adapta­ bility must always be circumstantial, it is not enough to proceed to laboratory  measurements and tests; the physical and social environment, diet, mode and  conditions of work, the economic situation and education of different classes  must also be studied, for as the normal is considered as the indicator of a  fitness or an adaptability, we must always ask ourselves to.what and for what  must we determine adaptability and fitness. For example: the author reports  the results of an investigation into thyroid enlargement in 11 to 15 years olds  in areas where the amount of iodine in the drinking water has been precisely  measured. In this case the normal is the thyroid which is externally inconspic­ uous. The conspicuous thyroid seems to indicate a specific mineral deficiency.  But as few children with a conspicuous thyroid end up with goiter, it can be  claimed that a clinically discernable hyperplasia expresses a degree of advanced  adaptation rather than the first stage of disease. Since the thyroid is always  smaller in Icelanders, and since, on the other hand, there are areas in China  where 60% of the inhabitants have goiters, it seems that we can speak of  national standards of normality. In short, in order to define the normal, we  must refer to concepts of eqUilibrium and adaptability, and bear in mind the  external environment, and the work which the organism or its parts must  accomplish.  The study we have just summarized is interesting, without being method­ ologically intolerant and ends by concluding that the preoccupations of  expertise and evaluation prevail over those of measurement in the strict sense  of the word.  In dealing with human norms we acknowledge that they are determined  as an organism's possibilities for action in a social situation rather than as an  organism's functions envisaged as a mechanism coupled with the physical  environment. The form and functions of the human body are the expression  not only of conditions imposed on life by the environment but also of social­ ly adopted modes of living in the environment. In our Essay we took into  account observations which allowed us to consider an interdependence be­ tween nature and culture to be probable in determining human organic norms,  from the fact of the psychosomatic relation,50 At the time our conclusions </p><div id="pagenum"><p>182</p></div><p id="page">168 NEW REFLECTIONS  might have seemed rash. Today it seems to us that the development of studies  in psychosomatic and psychosocial medicine, particularly in Anglo-Saxon  countries, would tend to confirm them. A well-known specialist in social  psychology, Otto Klineberg, in a study on tensions related to international  understanding,S1 has pointed out the psychosomatic and psychosocial causes  of varieties of reactions and disturbances involving apparently lasting modifi­ cations of organic constants. Chinese, Hindus, and Filipinos exhibit an aver­ age systolic pressure 15 to 20 points lower than Americans'. But the average  systolic blood pressure of Americans who have passed several years in China  fell during that period from 118 to 109. Similarly it could be noted that dur­ ing the period 1920-1930 hypertension in China was very rare. While finding  it 'simplistic in the extreme' Klineberg cites the remark of an American doc­ tor, made about 1929:  If we stay in China long enough we learn to accept things and our blood pressure falls.  Chinese in America learn to protest and to not accept and their blood pressure mounts.  To assume that Mao Tse-Tung has changed all that is not being ironic, but  simply applying the same method of interpreting psychosocial phenomena to  other political and social data.  The concept of adaptation and that of psychosomatic relation to which its  analysis leads, in the case of man, can be taken up again and reworked, so to  speak, as a function of theories of pathology which differ as to their basic  observations, but which converge in spirit. Relating physiological norms in  man to the diversity of modes of reaction and behavior which, in other res­ pects, show up cultural norms, is naturally extended by the study of specif­ ically human pathogenic situations. In man, unlike in laboratory animals, the  pathogenic stimuli or agents are never received by the organism as brute  physical facts, but are lived by the consciousness as signs of tasks or test~.  Hans Selye -almost at the same time as Reilly in France -was one of the  first to tackle the study of non-specific pathological syndromes, characteristic  reactions and behaviors in every disease considered at its onset, from the  general fact of 'feeling sick'. 52 A non-specific aggression (Le., a brusque  stimulation) provoked by any stimulus whatsoever -foreign body, purified  hormone, traumatism, pain, repeated emotion, imposed fatigue, etc. -triggers  off first an alarm reaction, also non-specific, consisting essentially in the  wholesale excitation of the sympathetic nerve which is accompanied by an  adrenalin and noradrenalin secretion. In short the alarm puts the organism in  a state of emergency, a state of indefinite parrying. This alarm reaction is  followed by either a specific state of resistance, as if the organism had identi-</p><div id="pagenum"><p>183</p></div><p id="page">ON ORGANIC NORMS IN MAN 169  fied the nature of the aggression, was adapting its response to the attack, and  was reducing its initial susceptibility to the outrage; or, by a state of exhaus­ tion when the intensity and ceaselessness of the aggression exceed reaction  capacities. These are Se1ye's three moments of the general adaptation syn­ drome. Adaptation is thus considered as the physiological function par excel­ lence. We propose to define it as organic impatience with the indiscreet  interventions or provocations of the environment, be it cosmic (action of  physico-chemical agents) or human (emotions). If by physiology we under­ stand the science of the functions of normal man, it must be recognized that  this science rests on the postulate that normal man is the man of nature. As  one physiologist, Bacq, wrote: "Tranquility, laziness, psychic indifference are  decisive trumps for the maintenance of normal physiology". 53 But perhaps  human physiology is always more or less af)plied physiology, physiology of  work, of sport, of leisure, of life at high altitudes, etc., that is, the biological  study of man in cultural situations which generate varied aggressions. 54 In  this sense we would find in Se1ye's theories confirmation of the fact that  norms are recognized by their divergences.  Under the name of 'adaptation diseases' must be understood all kinds of  disorders of the function of resistance to disturbances, diseases of the func­ tion of resistance to harm. By this let us understand reactions which go be­ yond their goal, which run on their impetus and persevere until the aggression  has stopped. Now is the time to say with F. Dagognet:  The sick person creates disease by the very excess of his defence and by the importance  of a reaction which protects less than it exhausts and upsets. The remedies which inhibit  or stabilize take precedence over all those which stimulate, enchance, or sustain. 55  It is not within our competence to decide whether Seyle's observations and  those of Reilly and his school are identical and whether the humoral mechan­ isms invoked by one and the neuro-vegetative mechanisms invoked by the  others are complementary or not.56 We consider only the convergence of  these theses on the following point: the predominance of the notion of  pathogenic syndrome over that of pathogenic agent, the subordination of the  notion of lesion to that of the disturbance of functions. In a famous lecture,  contemporary with the early investigations of Reilly and Selye, P. Abrami  drew attention to the number and importance of functional disturbances,  which, from the point of view of the clinical symptomatology of identical  lesions, are sometimes capable of diversifying, and above all in the long run,  sometimes capable of giving birth to organic lesions. 57  By now, we are far from the wisdom of the body. In effect, one could </p><div id="pagenum"><p>184</p></div><p id="page">170 NEW REFLECTIONS  suspect as much by comparing adaptation diseases with all the phenomena of  anaphylaxia, allergy, that is to say, all the organism's phenomena of hyper­ reactivity against an aggression to which it is sensitized. In this case disease  consists in the immoderacy of the organic response, in the outburst and stub­ bornness of the defense, as if the organism aimed badly, calculated badly. The  term 'error' came naturally to the minds of pathologists to designate a dis­ turbance whose origin is to be sought in the physiological function itself and  not in the external agent. In identifying histamine, Sir Henry Dale had con­ sidere"d it as a product of 'organic autopharmacology'. From then on can a  physiological phenomenon which ends up in what Bacq calls: "The veritable  suicide of the organism by means of toxic substances which it stocks in its  own tissues", be called anything other than error?58 </p><div id="pagenum"><p>185</p></div><p id="page">III  A NEW CONCEPT IN PATHOLOGY: ERROR  In our Essay we compared the ontological conception of disease, in which  disease is portrayed as the qualitative opposite of health, with the positivist  conception, which derives it quantitatively from the normal state. When  disease is considered as an evil, therapy is given for a revalorization; when  disease is considered as deficiency or excess, therapy consists in compensa­ tion. Against Bernard's conception of disease we set the existence of illnesses  such as alkaptonuria, whose symptom can in no way be derived from the  normal state and whose process -the incomplete metabolism of tyrosine - bears no quantitative relation to the normal process.59 It must be acknowl­ edged today that even then our argument could have been further solidified  by being more broadly buttressed with examples, by considering albinism and  cystinuria.  Since 1909 these metabolic diseases, because they block reactions at an  intermediary stage, have been given the striking name of 'inborn errors of  metabolism',60 a term coined by Sir Archibald Garrod. Hereditary biochemi­ cal disturbances, nevertheless these genetic diseases cannot manifest them­ selves as early as birth, but rather in the course of time and should the occa­ sion present itself, as for example, in the human organism's lack of a diastase  (glucose-6-phosphatase deshydrogenase) which gives rise to no disturbance as  long as the subject does not introduce beans into his diet or take quinine to  combat malaria. For fifty years medicine had recognized only half a dozen of  these diseases, and they could be considered rarities. This explains why the  concept of inborn metabolic error was not a common concept in pathology at  the time we undertook our medical studies. Today hereditary biochemical  diseases number about one hundred. The identification and treatment of  some of the particularly distressing ones such as phenylketonuria or phenyl­ pyruvic imbecility have given grounds for great hopes in extending the genetic  explanation of diseases. The etiology of sporadic or endemic diseases such as  goiter is being revised in the light of research on biochemical anomalies of a  genetic nature. 61 So we can imagine that while the concept of inborn error of  metabolism has not become a popular concept, strictly speaking, it is never­ theless a common one today. The terms 'anomaly', 'lesion', borrowed from  the language of morphological pathology, have been imported into the  171 </p><div id="pagenum"><p>186</p></div><p id="page">172 NEW REFLECTIONS  domain of biochemical phenomena.62  At the outset, the concept of hereditary biochemical error rested on the  ingenuity of a metaphor; today it is based on the solidity of an analogy. In­ sofar as the fundamental concepts of the biochemistry of amino acids and  macromolecules are concepts borrowed from information theory, such as  code or message; and insofar as the structures of the matter of life are linear  structures, the negative of order is inversion, the negative of sequence is con­ fusion, and the substitution of one arrangement for another is error. Health is  genetic and enzymatic correction. To be sick is to have been made false, to  be false, not in the sense of a false bank note or a false friend, but in the sense  of a 'false fold' [Le., wrinkle: faux p/i] or a false rhyme. Since enzymes are  the mediators through which the genes direct intracellular protein syntheses,  and since the information necessary for this function of direction and surveil­ lance is inscribed in the DNA molecules at the chromosome level, this infor­ mation must be transmitted as a message from the nucleus to the cytoplasm  and must be interpreted there, so that the sequence of amino acids constitut­ ing the protein to be synthesized is reproduced, recopied. But whatever the  mode, there is no interpretation which does not involve a possible mistake.  The substitution of one amino acid for another creates disorder through mis­ understanding the command. For example, in the case of sickle-cell anemia,  that is, red blood cells shaped like a sickle because of retraction following a  lowering of oxygen pressure, the hemoglobin is abnormal because of the sub­ stitution of valine for glutamiC acid in the globulin's amino acid chain.  The introduction of the concept of error into pathology is a fact of great  importance as much in terms of the change it reveals in what it brings to bear  in man's attitude toward disease, as in terms of the new status which is sup­ posedly established in the relationship between knowledge and its object. It  would be very tempting to denounce an identification of thought and nature,  to protest that the steps of thought are ascribed to nature, that error is  characteristic of judgment, that nature can be a witness, but never a judge,  etc. Apparently everything happens, in effect, as if the biochemist and  geneticist attributed their knowledge as chemist and geneticist to the elements  of the hereditary patrimony, as if enzymes were supposed to know or must  know the reactions according to which chemistry analyses their action and  could, in certain instances or at certain times, ignore one of them or misread  the terms. But it must not be forgotten that information theory cannot be  broken down, and that it concerns knowledge itself as well as its objects,  matter or life. In this sense to know is to be informed, to learn to decipher or  decode. There is then no difference between the error of life and the error of </p><div id="pagenum"><p>187</p></div><p id="page">A NEW CONCEPT IN PATHOLOGY: ERROR 173  thought, between the errors of informing and informed information. The first  furnishes the key to the second. From the philosophical point of view it  would be a question of a new kind of Aristotelianism, on the condition, of  course, that Aristotelian psychobiology and the modern technology of trans­ mission not be confused.63  In certain respects this notion of error in the biochemical composition  of this or that constituent of an organism is also Aristotelian. According  to Aristotle, a monster is an error of nature which was mistaken about  matter. If in contemporary molecular pathology, error generates formal flaws,  hereditary biochemical errors are always considered as a microanomaly, a  micromonstrosity. And just as a certain number of congenital morphological  anomalies are interpreted as a fixation of the embryo at a stage of develop­ ment which should normally be passed through, so a certain number of  metabolic errors are like an interruption or suspension of a series of chemical  reactions.  In such a conception of disease the harm is truly radical. If it manifests  itself at the level of the organism taken as a whole, at grips with an environ­ ment, it remains at the very roots of the organization, at the level where it is  still only linear structure, where not the domain but the order of the living  being begins. Disease is not a fall that one has, an attack to which one suc­ cumbs, but an original flaw in macromolecular form. If, in principle, organi­ zation is a kind of language, the genetically determined disease is no longer a  mischievous curse but a misunderstanding. There are bad readings of a hemo­ globin just as there are bad readings of a manuscript. But here we are dealing  with a word which comes from no mouth, with a writing which comes from  no hand. There is then no ill-will behind the illfate. To be sick is to be bad,  not as a bad boy but as poor land. Disease is no longer related to individual  responsibility; no more imprudence, no more excess to incriminate, not even  collective responsibility as in the case of epidemics. As living beings, we are  the effect of the very laws of the multiplication of life, as sick men we are the  effect of universal mixing, love, and chance. All this makes us unique, as has  often been written to console us for having been made from balls drawn by  lot in the urn of Mendelian heredity. Unique, certainly, but sometimes also  badly turned out. It is not too serious if it is only a matter of error in the  metabolism of fructose because of the lack of hepatic aldolase.64 It is more  serious if it is a question of hemophilia, arising from the lack of synthesis of  a globulin. And what is to be said, if not inadequately, if we are dealing with  an error in the metabolism of tryptophane which, according to J. Lejeune,  determines Mongolian trisomy? </p><div id="pagenum"><p>188</p></div><p id="page">174 NEW REFLECTIONS  The term 'error' mobilizes the affectivity less than the terms 'disease' or 'ill',  wrongly nevertheless, if it is true that error is, at the outset, miscarriage. This  is why the introduction of theoretical illusion into the vocabulary of pathol­ ogy lets certain people hope, perhaps, for progress toward rationality in  negative vital values. In fact when the eradic~tion of error is obtained, it is  irreversible, while the cure for a disease is sometimes the open door to an­ other, hence the paradox of 'diseases which are dangerous to cure".65  Nevertheless it can be maintained that the notion of innate organic errors  is anything but reassuring. It takes a great deal of clarity coupled with great  courage not to prefer an idea of disease where some feeling of individual cul­ pability can still find a place in an explanation of disease which pulverizes  and scatters its causality in the familial genome, in a legacy which the legatee  cannot refuse since legacy and legatee are but one. But in the end it must be  admitted that the notion of error, like the concept of pathology, is polysemic.  If it consists, at the outset, in a confusion of formula, a false taken for the  truth, it is recognized as such at the conclusion of research which has been  stimulated by the difficulty of living, or by pain, or by someone's death. In  relation to the denial of death, pain, difficulty in living, that is, to medicine's  raisons d'etre, the error of enzymatic reading is experienced by the man who  suffers from it as a fault of conduct without the fault of the conductor. In  short, the use of the term designating the logical fault does not succeed in  totally exorcising from medical semantics the traces of anguish felt with the  idea which we must count with an original abnormality.  Less reassuring still is the idea that it is appropriate to develop a medical  counterpart to hereditary errors when this idea is formed as an idea and not  as a desire. By definition a treatment cannot put an end to what is not the  consequence of an accident. Heredity is the modern name of substance. We  can imagine that it is possible to neutralize the effects of an error of meta­ bolism by constantly furnishing the organism with the reaction product  which is indispensable to the exercise of that function, of which an incom­ plete chain of reactions deprives it. And this is what is successfully done in  the case of phenylpyruvic oligophrenia. But to compensate an organism's  deficiencies for life only perpetuates a solution of distress. The real solution  to heresy is extirpation. Consequently why not dream of hunting for hetero­ dox genes, of a genetic inquisition? And while waiting, why not deprive sus­ pect sires of the liberty of sowing broadcast? We know that these dreams are  not only dreams for some biologists of very different philosophical persuasion,  if we may call it that. But in dreaming these dreams, we enter another world,  bordering on the bravest of Aldous Huxley's from which sick individuals, </p><div id="pagenum"><p>189</p></div><p id="page">A NEW CONCEPT IN PATHOLOGY: ERROR 175  their particular diseases, and their doctors have been eliminated. The life of a  natural population is portrayed as a lotto sack and the functionaries delegated  by the life sciences have the task of verifying the regularity of its numbers be­ fore the players are allowed to draw them from the sack to ft11 their cards. At  the beginning of this dream we have the generous ambition to spare innocent  and impotent living beings the atrocious burden of producing errors of life.  At the end there are the gene police, clad in the geneticists' sCience. For all  that it should not be concluded that one is obliged to respect a genetic 'laisser­ faire, laisser-passer', but only obliged to remind medical consciousness that to  dream of absolute remedies is often to dream of remedies which are worse  than the ill.  If diseases caused by innate chemical malformations are numerous as to their  variety, none is widespread. If it were otherwise, the concept· of the wisdom  of the body would seem very irrelevant, to which one may answer that the  errors of organization do not contradict the wisdom of organisms, that is, the  results of organization. What was once true of finality is true today of organi­ zation. ,Against finality one has always invoked life's failures, the disharmony  of organisms, or the rivalry of living species, macroscopic or microscopic. But  if these facts represent objections to a real, ontological finality, they run  counter to arguments supporting a pOSSible, operative finality. If there were a  perfect, finished finality, a complete system of relations of organic agreement,  the very concept of finality would have no meaning as a concept, as a plan  and model for thinking about life, for the simple reason that there would be  no grounds for thought, no grounds for thinking in the absence of all dis­ parity between possible organization and real organization. The thought of  finality expresses the limitation of life's finality. If this concept has a mean­ ing, it is because it is the concept of a meaning, the concept of a possible, and  thus not guaranteed, organization.  In fact the explanation of the rarity of biochemical diseases lies in the fact  that hereditary metabolic anomalies often remain hidden as non-activated  tendencies. In the absence of chance encounters with this component of life's  environment or that effect of vital competition, these anomalies can be ig­ nored by their bearers. Just as not all pathogenic germs determine an infection  in any host under any circumstances, so not all biochemical lesions are some­ one's disease. In certain ecological contexts it even happens that they confer a  certain superiority on those who must then be called their beneficiaries. In  man, for example, a deficiency in glucose-6-phosphate-deshydrogenase has  been diagnosed only when anti-malarial drugs (quinine) were administered to </p><div id="pagenum"><p>190</p></div><p id="page">176 NEW REFLECTIONS  Blacks in the United States. Now according to Dr Henri Pequignot:  When we study how an enzymatic disease, which is genetic, could maintain itself in the  Black population, we realize that these subjects are in so much better shape that the 'sick  people' afflicted with this disturbance are particularly resistant to malaria. Their ances­ tors in black Africa were 'normal' people in relation to others who were unfit, since they  were resistant to malaria while the others died from it.66  While recognizing that certain innate biochemical errors receive their even­ tual pathological value from a relation between the organism and the environ­ ment, as certain lapses or mistaken acts, according to Freud, receive their  value as symptoms from a relation to a situation, we are taking care not to  define the normal and the pathological in terms of their simple relation to the  phenomenon of adaptation. After a quarter of a century, this concept has  received such an application in psychology and sociology, often inopportune,  that it can only be used in the most critical spirit, even in biology. The  psycho-social definition of the normal in terms of adaptedness implies a  concept of society which surreptitiously and wrongly assimilates it to an  environment, that is, to a system of determinisms when it is a system of  constraints which, already and before all relations between it and the environ­ ment, contains collective norms for evaluating the quality of these relations.  To define abnormality in terms of social maladaptation is more or less to  accept the idea that the individual must subscribe to the fact of such a  society, hence must accomodate himself to it as to a reality which is at the  same time a good. Because of the conclusions of our first chapter, it seems  legitimate to us to be able to refuse this kind of definition without being  charged with anarchism. If societies are badly unified sets of means, they can  be denied the right to define normality in terms of the attitude of instrumen­ tal subordination which they valorize under the name of adaptation. At bot­ tom, this concept of adaptation, transported on the terrain of psychology and  SOCiology, returns to its original meaning. It is a popular concept describing  technical activity. Man adapts his tools and indirectly his organs and behavior  to this material, or that situation. At the moment of its introduction into  biology in the nineteenth century, the concept preserved the meaning of a  relation of externality, of confrontation between an organic form and an  environment opposing it, from its domain of importation. This concept has  since been theoretically conceived as starting from two inverse principles,  teleological and mechanist. According to one, the living being adapts itself to  conform to the search for functional satisfaction; according to the other, the  living being is adapted under the effect of necessities that may be mechanical, </p><div id="pagenum"><p>191</p></div><p id="page">A NEW CONCEPT IN PATHOLOGY: ERROR 177  physico-chemical or biological (the other living creatures in the biosphere). In  the first interpretation, adaptation is the solution to a problem of an optimum  forming the factual data of the environment and the living being's demands;  in the second, adaptation expresses a state of equilibrium, whose lower limit  defines the worst for the organism, which is the risk of death. But in both  theories, the environment is considered as a physical fact, not as a biological  fact, as an already constituted fact and not as a fact to be constituted. By  contrast, if the organism-environment relation is considered as the effect of a  really biological activity, as the search for a situation in which the living being  receives, instead of submits to, influences and qualities which meet its de­ mands, then the environments in which the living beings find themselves are  carved out by them, centered on them. In this sense the organism is not  thrown into an environment to which he must submit, but he structures his  environment at the same time that he develops his capacities as an organism.67  This is particularly true of environments and modes of life peculiar to man,  at the heart of technical-economic groups which, in a given geographical en­ vironment, are characterized less by the activities which are offered them than  by those which they choose. Under these conditions the normal and abnormal  are determined less by the encounter of two independent causal series, the  organism and the environment, than by the quantity of energy at the disposal  of the organic agent for delimiting and structuring this field of experiences  and enterprises, called its environment. But, you will ask, where is the measure  of this quantity of energy? It is to be sought nowhere other than in the history  of each one of us. Each of us fixes his norms by choosing his models of exer­ cise. The norm of a long distance runner is not that of a sprinter. Each of us  changes his norms according to his age and former norms. The norm of the  former sprinter is not that of a champion. It is normal, that is, in conformity  with the biological law of aging, that the progressive reduction of the margins  of security involves lowering the thresholds of resistance to aggressions from  the environment. The norms of an old man would have been considered defi­ ciencies in the same man just reaching adulthood. This recognition of the  individual and chronological relativity of norms is not skepticism before multi­ plicity but tolerance of variety. In the 1943 Essay we called 'normativity' the  biological capacity to challenge the usual norms in case of critical situations,  and proposed measuring health by the gravity of the organic crises which are  surmounted by the establishment of a new physiological order. 68  In the admirable, moving pages of The Birth of the Clinic, Michel Foucault  has shown how Bichat made "the medical gaze pivot on itself', in order to </p><div id="pagenum"><p>192</p></div><p id="page">178 NEW REFLECTIONS  call death to account for life. 69 Not being a physiologist, we do not presume  to believe that in the same way we have called disease to account for health.  It is very clear that that is what we would have wanted to do so as not to hide  our delight in having found after all the absolution of our former ambition in  Dr. Henri Pequignot:  In the past all the people who tried to build a science of the normal without being care­ ful to start from the pathological considered as the immediate given have ended up in  often ridiculous failures. 70  As we are quite persuaded of the fact, analyzed above, that the knowledge of  life, like the knowledge of society, assumes the priority of infraction over  regularity, we would like to end these new reflections on the normal and the  pathological by sketching a paradoxical pathology of the normal man, by  showing that the consciousness of biological normality includes the relation  to disease, the recourse to disease as the only touchstone which this con­ sciousness recognizes and thus demands.  In what sense is the normal man's disease to be understood? Not in the  sense that only the normal man can become sick, as only the ignorant can  become wise. Not in the sense that slight accidents happen to disturb without  nonetheless altering a state of equality and equilibrium: colds, headaches, a  rash, colic, every accident without the value of a symptom, a warning without  alarm. By disease of the normal man we must understand the disturbance  which arises in the course of time from the permanence of the normal state,  from the incorruptible uniformity of the normal, the disease which arises  from the deprivation of diseases, from an existence almost incompatible with  disease. It must be admitted that the normal man knows that he is so only in  a world where every man is not normal, consequently he knows he is suscepti~  ble to disease, as a good pilot knows he can run his ship aground, as an urbane  man knows he can commit a blunder ['gaffe'] . The normal man feels himself  capable of running his body aground, but experiences the certitude of re­ pelling the eventuality. In the case of disease the normal man is he who lives  the assurance of being able to arrest within himself what in another would  run its course. In order for the normal man to believe himself so, and call  himself so, he needs not the foretaste of disease but its projected shadow.  In the long run a malaise arises from not being sick in a world where there  are sick men. And what if this were not because one is stronger than the  disease or stronger than others, but simply because the occasion has not pre­ sented itself? And what if, in the end, when the occasion does arise, one were  to show oneself as weak, as unprepared as, or perhaps more so than others? </p><div id="pagenum"><p>193</p></div><p id="page">A NEW CONCEPT IN PATHOLOGY: ERROR 179  Thus there arises in the normal man an anxiety about having remained nor­ mal, a need for disease as a test of health, that is, as its proof, an unconscious  search for disease, a provocation of it. Normal man's disease is the appear­ ance of a fault in his biological confidence in himself.  Our sketch of pathology is obviously a fiction. The analyses for which it  substitutes can be rapidly reconstituted with Plato's help.  Yet that is what we say literally -we say that the physician erred and the calculator and  the schoolmaster. But the truth, I take it, is, that each of these in so far as he is that  which we entitle him never errs; so that, speaking precisely, since you are such a stickler  for precision, no craftsman errs. For it is when his knowledge abandons him that he who  goes wrong goes wrong -when he is not a craftsman. 71  Let us apply what is said above of the doctor to his client. We shall say that  the healthy man does not become sick insofar as he is healthy. No healthy  man becomes sick, for he is sick only insofar as his health abandons him and  in this he is not healthy. The so-called healthy man thus is not healthy. His  health is an equilibrium which he redeems on inceptive ruptures. The menace  of disease is one of the components of health. </p><div id="pagenum"><p>194</p></div><p id="page">EPILOGUE  Undoubtedly our conception of the nonnal is very archaic, while it is -un­ doubtedly because it is -as was pointed out to us in 1943, a conception of  life such as can be fonned when one is young. A judgment which we did not  intend has delighted us and we ask to be allowed to apply it to ourself: "The  notion of this ideal which is the nonnal is identified with the previous  euphoric state of the subject who has just fallen sick .... The only pathology  ascertained at the time was a pathology of young subjects".'12 And undoubt­ edly it took the tennerity of youth to believe oneself equal to the task of a  study of medical philosophy on nonns and the nonnal. The difficulty of such  an undertaking makes one tremble. We are aware of this today as we com­ plete these pages of resumption. With this confession, the reader will measure  how much we, in confonnity with our discussion on nonns, have reduced our  own with time.  181 </p><div id="pagenum"><p>195</p></div><p id="page">NOTES TO SECTION I  1 The References in square brackets refer to the Bibliography to Section I on pages 187- 192.

Infection is  invisible only from the clinical point of view and on the macroscopic level. But from the  biological point of view and on the humoral level, infection is apparent since it can be  expressed in terms of the presence of antibodies in the serum. Nevertheless, infection is  183 </p><div id="pagenum"><p>196</p></div><p id="page">184 ON THE NORMAL AND THE PATHOLOGICAL  only a biological fact, a modification of the humors.

The pulse decreases in frequency as training advances. This decreases is  more pronounced in a thirty year old subject than in a twenty year old. It also depends  on the kind of sport engaged in. In an oarsman a pulse of 40 indicates very good form.

However, we are mindful of the fact that old age is a normal stage of life.
