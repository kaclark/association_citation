A sabbatical grant and generous leaveofabsence f rom The Catholic University ofAmerica and a grant provided in ideal circumstances by the Alexander vonHumboldt-Stiftung allowed me to develop these theses. Completion of the book was made possible by the supportmade available by the Université de Fribourg. I am also much indebted to friends and colleagues for their assistance.Henri-Dominique Saffrey made many helpful suggestions and corrections for which I am grateful, as I am to OxfordUniversity Press's reader for constructive and detailed comments. Ilsetraut Hadot also proposed improvements to thebook, which is indebted to her research as it is to the work ofPierre Hadot, a longstanding source ofinspiration f orme. Leendert Westerink and John Duffy were unfailing in their expert assistance. I am particularly grateful to WernerBeierwaltes: he put me on the track ofIamblichus and gave me invaluable advice and help during my stay in Freiburg-im-Breisgau and Munich. The de ﬁciencies that remain in the book are ofcourse mine. My wif e Carra gave my work her full encouragement and support throughout many years. Amy Eiholzer-Silver prepared the typescripts of the ﬁnal revisions ofthe book with intelligent care.In an effort to simplify footnotes as far as possible, I have adopted the practice of referring to modern works by thename ofthe author and the year ofpublication: f urther details may be f ound in the second part ofthe Bibliography.The texts ofancient authors are cited by page and line in the editions listed in the ﬁrst part ofthe Bibliography (f or fragments, by fragment number and line).

Porphyry's edition opened with a biography ofPlotinus, the Vita Plotini, that was intended, among other things, to introduce the reader to Plotinus as the ﬁgure ofthe ideal philosopher. Inspired by this model and by the wisdom and otherworldly serenity that it promised, the reader would move on toread the Plotinian tractates that followed. These tractates Porphyry divided and grouped in six sets of nine works(‘Enneads ’) and arranged the sets in such a way that their sequence led the mind ofthe reader up f rom the material world, through ever higher levels, to the source ofall reality, the One. Thus Porphyry's edition, taken as a whole ( Vita and Enneads ), constituted a systematic introduction, initiation, and path to the highest truths ofphilosophy. Porphyry's edition could give his contemporaries every reason to feel con ﬁdent in the strength and promise oftheir ancient philosophical culture: Plotinus had brought together with considerable success the many philosophicaltendencies ofpreceding centuries into a whole that came astonishingly close to Plato, ifnot always in doctrine, certainlyin emotional and spiritual power, in intellectual depth, and in the promise ofa comprehensive understanding ofreality.These qualities in Plotinus' philosophy had already attracted the attention and admiration ofmany important men ofletters and ofaction, pagan as well as Christian. Greek philosophy, it seemed, had acquired in Plotinus and in hisschool new vigour.This was indeed the case. Philosophical schools sprang up and developed throughout the Eastern part ofthe RomanEmpire under the direct and indirect inspiration ofPlotinus' f undamental ideas. 1Porphyry's pupil Iamblichus set up a school in Syria which in turn contributed to a revival ofPlatonic philosophy at Athens in the ﬁfth 1Cf. Blumenthal (1981); much remains to be investigated concerning the ways in which Plotinus was read and criticized by later Neoplatonists such as Ia mblichus (a subject</p><div id="pagenum"><p>I hope to discuss elsewhere) and Proclus, who wrote a Commentary on Plotinus.</p></div><div id="pagenum"><p>century. The ﬁrst major ﬁgures ofthe Athenian school, Syrianus and Proclus, had among their pupils philosophers, in</p></div><p id="page">particular Ammonius, who would be responsible for an important period in the life of Platonic philosophy atAlexandria, producing in ﬂuential commentators on Aristotle such as John Philoponus. Even when the Athenian school was closed by imperial decree in 529 2it included two major philosophers, Damascius and Simplicius. And the Platonic school at Alexandria managed to carry on, thanks, it appears, to its having reached an understanding withchurch authorities.This last, extremely dynamic and fruitful period in the history of Greek philosophy has in recent years been receivingthe attention it deserves. The philosophical and scienti ﬁc interest ofthe ideas ofIamblichus, Philoponus, Simplicius, and others has been stressed. 3The important role late Antique Platonism (or ‘Neoplatonism ’) played in the development ofphilosophy in the Islamic, Byzantine, and Western Medieval worlds is better known. However, muchremains to be investigated. In particular the development ofNeoplatonic philosophy in the period between Plotinusand the Athenian and Alexandrian schools ofthe ﬁfth and sixth centuries is very far from being understood. This has to do primarily with the f act that, ifthe works ofPlotinus and oflate Neoplatonists such as Proclus and Simpliciushave in large part survived, the same is not true ofthe philosophers who came between them. In particular almost allthe major philosophical works ofPorphyry and Iamblichus have disappeared: all that remains as evidence f or theirideas are some minor works, fragments, and quotations and repor ts to be found in later authors such as Proclus. From such bits and pieces a reconstruction must be attempted, without which the history ofGreek Neoplatonism cannot bewritten. 4 A particularly dif ﬁcult problem in this regard is posed by the case ofPorphyry's pupil Iamblichus. Both the later Neoplatonists and modern research agree that Iamblichus was largely responsible for changing Plotinus' philosophy sothat it would take the form it has later, for example, in Proclus. 5Signiﬁcant progress has been made in2 INTRODUCTION 2Cf. Blumenthal (1978). 3Cf. Sorabji (1983), (1987); Sambursky (1962). 4For Porphyry cf. P. Hadot (1968), Smith (1974); the task of reconstruction is made all the more dif ﬁcult in that the reports in later authors cannot be treated uncritically, i.e. as iftheir precise source need not be identi ﬁed and as ifthese authors do not report in terms oftheir own philosophical perspectives: on this problem cf . Steel (1978), 12–13; Gersh (1978), 7 –8.</p><div id="pagenum"><p>5Cf. Praechter's pioneering work (1910), (1932); Steel (1978), 12.</p></div><div id="pagenum"><p>the study ofIamblichus in recent years. In particular the f ragments remaining ofhis commentaries on Plato have been</p></div><p id="page">collected, translated, and discussed by Dillon (1973) and a ﬁrst synthesis based on a large body ofevidence has been presented by Larsen (1972). However, much remains unclear about the preciseways in which Iamblichus altered the course ofNeoplatonic philosophy. To understand this we would need to ﬁnd out more about Iamblichus' philosophical ideas and the ways in which they were conveyed to, and used by his successors.In this book I propose some answers to the question ofIamblichus' place in the history oflate Greek philosophy, usingevidence that has, in this regard, never been exploited. Besides playing a pivotal role in later Neoplatonism we alsoknow that Iamblichus attempted to revive Pythagoreanism (in some sense) as a philosophy. 6Indeed the ﬁrst four books ofa work he devoted to Pythagoreanism are still extant. Iamblichus' work On Pythagoreanism was furthermore, as I shall show, known to and used at Athens by Syrianus and Proclus. This work then not only allows us access to someofIamblichus' philosophical ideas. It also provides a concrete link between him and his philosophical successors. Asyet, however, Iamblichus' revival ofPythagoreanism has not been examined, his work On Pythagoreanism —for reasons to be noted later —not given much weight, and the importance ofthis work and more generally ofhis revival of Pythagoreanism for the history of later Neoplatonism largely ignored. In discussing this evidence I hope to show thatit can serve to shed new light on a number ofspeci ﬁc areas in the history ofGreek philosophy af ter Plotinus. Ever since Plato and his Academy Platonists have shown great interest in the ﬁgure ofPythagoras and a strong inclination to ‘Pythagoreanize ’. In order then to assess properly Iamblichus' attempt to revive Pythagoreanism as a philosophy it will be necessary ﬁrst to survey various Pythagoreanizing tendencies among his immediate philosophical predecessors (Chapter 1). The analysis ofIamblichus' Pythagoreanizing programme will then begin with a study oftheﬁrst four extant books of the work ( On Pythagoreanism ) he devoted to the subject (Chapter 2). Although the remaining books ofthis work no longer survive, it has recently been possible to recover excerpts f rom Books V –VII preserved in a Byzantine author, Michael Psellus. These excerpts are examined here for the ﬁrst time (Chapter 3). This newINTRODUCTION 3</p><div id="pagenum"><p>6Cf.

It will be shown furthermore</p></div><p id="page">(Chapter 4) that what we know ofIamblichus' other works indicates that there also he Pythagoreanized Platonicphilosophy, an important consequence ofwhich was a strong mathematizing ofthis philosophy.In Part Two ofthe book the impact ofIamblichus' Pythagoreanizing ofNeoplatonism will be discussed with ref erencein particular to the Athenian School at its beginnings in the ﬁfth century (Chapter 5), as represented by Syrianus (Chapter 6) and by Syrianus' brilliant and very in ﬂuential successor Proclus (Chapters 7 –10). In these chapters I shall show that Iamblichus' work On Pythagoreanism and more generally his Pythagoreanizing programme were familiar to Syrianus and Proclus and may be used as providing an approach to their thought in which the extent to which theywere inspired by and also moved away from Iamblichus' programme may be measured. Most emphasis will be given toProclus, not only on account ofhis historical importance and ofthe f act that much ofhis work survives, but alsobecause he seems to have reacted critically and rejected in certain respects Iamblichus' revival ofPythagoreanism, aresponse that throws light on the constitution ofhis philosophy.The reader will infer from the above that what follows is limited in its ambitions. My purpose is to bring out whatinformation can be found in some unexploited and in some new evidence concerning a particular theme and period inthe history oflater Greek philosophy. One perspective will serve as guide, namely the revival ofPythagoreanismviewed as a claim both about the origins and about the nature ofPlatonic philosophy. Only the works ofa f ew, selectedphilosophers will be discussed. There are ofcourse other themes, other philosophers that would need to be consideredalso, were a comprehensive history oflater Neoplatonism to be attempted. 7This book is limited furthermore in that it touches on mathematics only in so far as mathematics, under the pressure of Pythagoreanizing tendencies, became asubject ofincreasing interest to philosophers in late Antiquity and came to mark their theories. The history ofmathematics per sein late Antiquity is not therefore considered. Nor is the question of the origins and original doctrines ofPythagoreanism. Yet a better appreciation ofhow Neoplatonic philosophers appropriated Pythagorean4INTRODUCTION 7One important theme that would require discussion is the role played by ‘Chaldaean ’oracles and theurgy, on which cf.

One would need to discuss questions such asthese: Did there exist during this period Pythagorean or Neopythagorean ‘sects ’? Who belonged to these sects, if indeed they existed? Was Ammonius, Plotinus' teacher, a member? Or should he be considered, along with others suchas Eudorus and Moderatus, as merely a Platonist who was inclined to Pythagoreanize? What are we to make in thiscontext ofsuch ‘Pythagorean ’ﬁgures as Apollonius ofTyana and Alexander ofAbonoteichus? What is the relation between the Pythagoreanism ofthis period and earlier f orms ofPythagoreanism? Does anything ofancientPythagoreanism still survive at this time? An adequate approach to these matters would require the collection andanalysis ofan extremely varied and widely scattered body ofevidence, both literary and archaeological, pagan andChristian. 8 The purpose ofthis introductory chapter is by comparison very limited: to supply some points ofref erence in relationto which Iamblichus' programme to Pythagoreanize Platonic philosophy can be better understood. I propose to selectfour thinkers who provided immediate precedents to what Iamblichus attempted in this programme, two of them wellknown to Iamblichus through their works, Numenius and Nicomachus, and two ofthem his teachers, Anatolius andPorphyry. In discussing these four predecessors of Iamblichus, I shall attempt to sketch their ideas concerning twogeneral issues that will emerge as central in Iamblichus' programme: (i) the role ofPythagoras in the history ofphilosophy and more generally in man's search for wisdom, and (ii) the relation between the Pythagorean 8Cf. e.g. Burkert (1961); Dörrie (1963); Armstrong (1967), 90 –106 (Merlan); Dillon (1977), ch. 7.

He was readand discussed in Plotinus' lectures; he was quoted by Porphyry; and Iamblichus thought him important enough toaccuse Neoplatonic colleagues —Porphyry, Harpocration, Theodore ofAsine, and perhaps Amelius —ofparroting him. 10He is referred to as a ‘Pythagorean ’both by Porphyry and by the Christians Origen and Eusebius.11This may have been Numenius' own description ofhimself , since it corresponds, as will be seen, to his original views about thehistory ofGreek philosophy and to the purpose he wished his work to accomplish in that history. And yet ifhe isplaced in the context ofhis own time, he is best understood as part ofa widespread and varied ef f ort in the ﬁrst centuries ADto interpret Plato's dialogues so as to reach a systematic Platonic dogma.12 Numenius wrote a remarkable book on the history ofphilosophy some extracts ofwhich are quoted by Eusebius (f rs.24–8). The title ofthe book, On the Dissension between the Academics and Plato, introduces the dominant theme, that of dissension, con ﬂict, war. The theme ofa ‘war’between philosophers is conventional. 13But Numenius develops it in interesting ways. It has ﬁrst a political signi ﬁcance. It refers to the disputes that increasingly tore apart Plato's school, the Academy (frs. 25, 27). Such strife —a characteristic ofthose disputations materialists and most bellicose of philosophers, the Stoics (fr. 24, 37 ff.) —produced a malfunctioning and unhappy Academy to which Numenius opposes the ﬁdelity to the Master and unity ofmind ofthe Pythagoreans and of10 PYTHAGOREANISM IN 2ND AND 3RD CENTURIES AD 9Cf. Numenius, Fragments, p. 7; Dillon (1977), 362. 10Cf. Leemans (1937), Test.nos. 18 –20, with Lewy (1956), 503 n. 23; Iamblichus is exploiting an old charge made against Plotinus (Porphyry, Vit. Plot. 17, 1–6). 11Numenius, frs. 1 a, 1 b, 1 c, 4 b, 24, 29, 52 (the texts in Calcidius and Nemesius probably derive from Porphyry, cf. Waszink [1964 ], 11, 25). 12Waszink (1966), 37 –9; O'Meara (1975), ch. 1. 13Cf. Maximus of Tyre, Or.26, 310, 4 –15. The term διάστασις in Numenius' title refers more technically to the distancing and confrontation preparatory to battle (cf.</p><div id="pagenum"><p>Numenius, frs. 24, 41; 25, 86 and 104).</p></div><div id="pagenum"><p>the Epicureans (fr. 24, 18 –36). Numenius is reluctant to refer to the latter (notorious and ignoble materialists that they</p></div><p id="page">are!), but he must: their peaceful unanimity produces a true, ideal community which stands as a constant reproach tothe squabblings of Plato's successors (cf. fr. 24, 33 –6). All this is reminiscent ofthe contrast depicted in Plato's Republic between the peaceful unity of mind of the correctly-functioning good state and the self-destructive dissensions andconﬂicts ofthe malf unctioning evil state. 14Numenius in his book is thus proposing a critique ofthe history ofthe Academy based on the criteria ofthe ideal state in Platonic political philosophy. These criteria provide him with themeans for both understanding and criticizing that history.When and how did the evil arise? Although Numenius is elusive on this point, it seems that he is prepared to ﬁnd the seeds ofcon ﬂict in Plato himself(cf . f r. 24, 62 –4), in the secretive way, between clarity and obscurity, in which Plato communicated Pythagorean doctrines. Numenius is not willing to ascribe this secretiveness to envy or maliciousnesson Plato's part. He will not therefore go as far as that Pythagorean theory, reported by Porphyry, which alleged thatPlato, Aristotle, and Plato's pupils plagiarized the best ofPythagorean doctrines, admitting as Pythagorean only thosetrivialities that would later become a subject ofmockery. 15 The theme ofdissension also has deeper, metaphysical connotations in Numenius' book. As he showed in hisinterpretation ofPlatonic ontology in his dialogue On the Good, change, ﬂux, disintegration are characteristics ofthe material world, whereas stability, unchangingness, self-integrity are proper to the world of true, immaterial being. 16This ontological contrast is applied by Numenius to his history ofPlato's Academy. Plato's successors increasingly f ailed tomaintain intact and unchanged the philosophy oftheir Master (f r. 24, 5 –18), so much so that the doctrine now in their hands has woefully disintegrated. 17Indeed the successors themselves begin to look veryNUMENIUS OF APAMEA 11 14Cf. the ὁμάνοιαandὁμοδοξ ίαofPlato's just state ( Rep.432 a, 433 c), and the μɛταβολ ή,πολυπϱαγμοσ ύνηandστάσιςin the evil state (cf. 434 b). Numenius refers to the Epicurean school as a ‘true state ’(fr. 24, 34πολιτ ɛίᾳ...ἀληθει ̑) in the sense of ‘true’(i.e. ideal) used by Plato (cf. Rep.372 e 6). 15Cf. Porphyry, Vit. Pyth. ch. 53, 61, 20 –7. It is usually assumed that this passage derives from the ﬁrst-century ADPlatonist/Pythagorean Moderatus ofGades. It should be noted, however, that the section in which Porphyry cites Moderatus ends just before (ch. 53, 61, 13, closing the passage beginning in ch. 48, 58, 21). Cf .

They must all be rejected (f r. 24, 68 –70). All innovation and change must be removed from the pure unchanging doctrine of Plato. 20This curious study ofPlato's Academy, which progressed by rejection ofthe history it described, seems to have been preceded by a similar attempt at puri ﬁcation, this time ‘separating ’Plato off from Aristotle and from the Stoics, a task all the more pressing in Numenius' time when much use was made ofthese philosophers in the interpretation ofPlato.21 What then is Plato thus purged? Pythagoras! (fr. 24, 70). If then Numenius described himself as a Pythagorean, heunderstood this in relation to his programme ofrejecting an adulterated and disintegrating Platonic tradition andrestoring Platonic doctrine to its original, i.e. Pythagorean, integrity. His view ofthe relation between Plato and12PYTHAGOREANISM IN 2ND AND 3RD CENTURIES AD 18In his edition of Numenius des Places has noticed (76) that the same expression is used (fr. 27, 11) for Carneades and (fr. 3, 11) for matter.

The difference then between Plato and Pythagoras is primarily one of style rather than doctrine.22Thus pure Platonic philosophy can be referred back to Pythagoras; pure Platonism is Pythagoreanism.Numenius also refers to Egyptians, Persian mages, Indians, Jews. One might wonder if he is here taking up the oldidea—popular since at least the time ofPlato and Aristotle —ofan ancient and superior wisdom possessed by Pythagoras, by other ancient Greek sages, and even by some barbarian nations. 23Numenius refers to these nations as corroborating Pythagorean doctrines; Jewish scripture is appealed to because it shares with Pythagoreanism the idea ofan immaterial deity. 24It is not clear however on what grounds Numenius explained the corroboration and agreement between Pythagorean truths and barbarian ideas. Did Pythagoras learn these truths from various barbarian, e.g.Egyptian, teachers? Did Numenius have in mind rather the (Stoic) theory that there are some fundamental ‘common conceptions ’shared by all nations and peoples? The surviving evidence is not adequate to permit ofan answer. 25We do not know how Numenius thought Pythagoras came in possession ofphilosophical truth. There is a suggestion in f r. 14that knowledge is a divine gift to man. Numenius here refers to Plato Philebus 16 c, where Prometheus is said to have conveyed knowledge as well as ﬁre from the gods to men. Did Numenius ﬁnd in Plato's reference to Prometheus an allusion to Pythagoras, an obvious and likely enough interpretation? Would he then have thought ofPythagoras as amediator oftruths revealed to him in some way by the gods? We simply do not know how Numenius read the passageofthe Philebus in its possible bearing on the attainment ofknowledge by Pythagoras and (to some degree, at least) by barbarian nations. 26 Little also can be said about Numenius' views on the Pythagorean mathematical sciences and their relation tophilosophy.

Did Numenius' Pythagoreanizing bring him so far as to soften the distinctions Plato makes here betweenmathematics and its objects, on the one hand, and the ‘highest study ’(called ‘dialectic ’) and its objects (pure being, or the Forms, and the source ofthe Forms, the Good), on the other? Did his Pythagorean programme prompt him toidentify mathematics with dialectic, numbers with Forms? The language of the passage in fr. 2 is not entirely clear onthis point. Numenius refers elsewhere (frs. 11, 15; 52, 6) to matter as a ‘dyad ’and to god as a ‘monad ’(fr. 52, 5) and a vague report (fr. 39) has him and many others seeing soul as a mathematical entity, the product of monad and dyad. Isthis simply the adoption ofa supposedly Pythagorean nomenclature that had been popular ever since its exploitation inPlato's Academy? 27Or should we speak ofa prof ound mathematization ofPlatonic metaphysics in Numenius? There is at any rate no sign ofsuch a mathematization in the f ragments that survive ofthe dialogue On the Good, a work that appears to be an attempt to develop systematically the science ofbeing and its source that Plato calls dialectic, a sciencethat starts from, but that goes beyond mathematics. 28 2.NicomachusofGerasa In the case ofNicomachus (roughly a contemporary ofNumenius)29the situation is almost the reverse: little is known ofhis views on Pythagoras, but a good deal can be discovered about his theories concerning the mathematical sciencesand their relation to philosophy. 3014 PYTHAGOREANISM IN THE 2ND AND 3RD CENTURIES AD 27The best account of Pythagoreanizing tendencies in Plato's Academy is Burkert (1972); cf. also Krämer (1964), 63 ff. 28Cf. fr. 2, 22 –3. The question Numenius sets as the theme of On the Good I,τίἐστιτὸὄν(loc. cit.; fr. 3, 1), reminds one of Aristotle's formulation of the subject of ‘ﬁrst philosophy ’or metaphysics ( Met.Γ1); however, Numenius develops his highest science in a quite different, Platonic direction: cf. O'Meara (1976). 29Cf. D'Ooge et al. (1926), 71 –2. On Dillon's argument (1969) for 196 as a date for Nicomachus' death cf. Tarán (1974), 113.</p><div id="pagenum"><p>30Cf. I.

Iamblichus' very high opinionofhim —as a ‘true Pythagorean ’(see below, Chapter 2) —assured the presence ofNicomachus' introductory</p></div><p id="page">mathematical writings in the curriculum ofNeoplatonist schools and was what prompted Proclus' particularattachment to him (see below, Chapter 7). The works that will be discussed here are his elementary Introduction to Arithmetic and a book known by the title Theologoumena arithmeticae that survives only in a summary ofit produced by the Byzantine Patriarch Photius in the ninth century and in excerpts preserved in an anonymous compilation also entitledTheologoumena arithmeticae. 31 Had Nicomachus' Life of Pythagoras survived, much more might be known about Nicomachus' understanding ofthe place ofPythagoras in the development ofscience and philosophy.32As it is, we must rely primarily on indications given in the Introduction to Arithmetic. In the introductory section ofthis work Nicomachus presents Pythagoras as the ﬁrst to establish science. Before him could be found various sorts of wisdom —some technical skills are given as examples —but Pythagoras ﬁrst restricted the application ofthe word wisdom ( σοϕία) in order to make it refer only to the‘science ofbeing ’, that is, an unshakeable grasp ofthe unchanging immaterial realities which are true being, as contrasted with the changing ﬂuid material world whose existence imitates and derives from true being (1, 5 –2, 19). Nicomachus uses (3, 9 –4, 5) the same passage in Plato's Timaeus (27 d) as is used byNICOMACHUS OF GERASA 15 31The anonymous Theol. arith. has been attributed to Iamblichus on the basis that Iamblichus' On Pythagoreanism VII was thought to have covered the same ground (for a critique cf. already Tannery [1885 a], 181– 2) Oppermann (1928) has made the strongest case for this attribution. He provides a careful analysis of the excerpts from Nicomachus' Theologoumena and from Anatolius' De dec. that make up the anonymous and argues (i) that it is in turn excerpted from a larger unitary work in which the texts ofNicomachus and Anatolius were assembled, and (ii) that this larger work is Iamblichus' On Pyth. VII. In support ofthe latter claim he notes that the ref erences in the anon. to an ‘Introduction ’(to arithmetic) correspond to Iambl. In Nic. (=On Pyth. IV) rather than to Nicom. Intro. arith. (compare anon. Theol. arith. 1, 10–18 with Iambl. In Nic. 11, 15 –24; however, compare also anon. Theol. arith. 3, 2–7 and Nicom. Intro. arith. 111, 17; 113, 2 –6). He who assembled the excerpts, it is assumed, is also the author ofthe ‘Introduction ’: Iamblichus. It is not excluded, however, that the anon. is simply using Iambl. In Nic. for what he takes to be the content of Nicom. Intro. arith. (cf. 83, 4 –6 for the title). At any rate the newly recovered excerpts from Iambl. On Pyth. VII (below, ch.3) show it re ﬂected a developed stage ofNeoplatonic metaphysics absent from the anon. Theol. arith. This suf ﬁces to show that the anon. Theol. arith., whoever its compiler might be, is not based on On Pyth. VII. 32Cf. D'Ooge, 79 –87, and Tarán (1974) for a list and discussion of Nicomachus' works. Burkert (1972), 98 ff., discusses material originating from Nicomachus' Life of</p><div id="pagenum"><p>Pythagoras.</p></div><div id="pagenum"><p>Numenius (fr. 7) to express this ontological distinction common in Platonic authors of the period. As in Numenius,the distinction is assumed to be Pythagorean. In Nicomachus it is fundamental, since it serves as the ground forPythagoras' achievement ofa strict de ﬁnition ofscience and its isolation f rom technical expertise.</p></div><p id="page">33Ifthe ontological distinction is conventionally drawn in Nicomachus, there are some novel aspects to it which will be considered shortly.At any rate it can be concluded that Nicomachus identi ﬁed Platonism with Pythagoreanism. How Pythagoras is supposed to have elaborated what wewould describe as ‘Platonic ’philosophy is not clear. In his Theologoumena, Nicomachus referred to the Babylonians and the Persians Zoroaster and Ostanes, 34but we do not know how Nicomachus understood the relation between them and Pythagoras.The Introduction to Arithmetic reveals much more about Nicomachus' views on the relation between the mathematical sciences and philosophy. His position seems to be at ﬁrst glance, however, inconsistent. On the one hand, he develops Plato's view in the Republic that the mathematical sciences prepare for a higher pursuit. They act as ‘ladders ’and ‘bridges ’to pure being, purifying the mind's eye, turning it away from material reality, and facilitating its access to true immaterial being (7, 21 –9, 4). Such ideas suggest that Nicomachus conceived ofa region ofpure being and its science different from and higher than the mathematical sciences and their objects. However, as one reads more of theIntroduction, it becomes less clear that Nicomachus really would wish to differentiate mathematics and its objects (in particular, number) from a higher science (dialectic) and its object (being). At 12, 6 –9, for example, he identi ﬁes number with pure being. It seems possible then that, in spite ofhis introductory claims, Nicomachus in f act tends toconsider mathematics, and especially the highest mathematical science, arithmetic, as the ﬁrst and highest form of knowledge, and number as the ﬁrst and highest form of being. This inconsistency can be analysed further in relation to the various accounts that Nicomachus provides in theIntroduction and in the Theologoumena ofthe production ofthe material world. The standard second-century Platonic cosmology is given: a divine craftsman, or ‘demiurge ’, models matter after ideal patterns (the Forms) in his mind. There are, however, some unusual elements in Nicomachus' version16PYTHAGOREANISM IN THE 2ND AND 3RD CENTURIES AD 33For Nicomachus' high claims for Pythagoras' scienti ﬁc achievements in music, cf. Levin (1975), 46 ff.</p><div id="pagenum"><p>34Cf. anon. Theol. arith. 56, 13 –15.</p></div><div id="pagenum"><p>ofthe cosmology. For instance, the patterns used in the ordering ofmatter are listed in the Theologoumena as‘quality,</p></div><p id="page">quantity, and the other categories ’; according to these ‘categories ’, and ‘from number ’, matter is ordered.35More information can be found in the Introduction about the ‘categories ’and their relation to number. They include (2, 21 –3, 5) qualities, quantities, shapes, sizes, equalities, relations, activities, dispositions, places, and times. In themselves theyare incorporeal and unchanging, sharing only per accidens in the materiality and ﬂux ofbodies. It has been suggested that Nicomachus' ‘categories ’are not categories at all (in the Aristotelian sense), but rather Platonic Forms. 36This is the case inasmuch as their ontological character, in particular their transcendence, is that ofthe Forms. Indeed, theyrepresent Nicomachus' interpretation ofthe Forms. At the same time, however, his choice ofthe term ‘category ’, and the particular categories he names, indicate that he views these Forms in close relation to the general structuring ofmatter.The way in which Nicomachus relates his Forms (or categories) to number is also unusual. In his Theologoumena he describes the Forms ofthings, quantity, quality, relation, as number, or rather as properties or ‘characters ’(ἰδιώματα) ofnumber. 37The categories are all virtually present already in the monad and are shown forth actually in the ﬁrst ten numbers, the decad.38The intention ofNicomachus is, I think, clear: to reduce the Platonic Forms, the models ofthe universe which he identi ﬁes with Aristotelian categories, to the formal properties of number; the universe is organized according to the various properties ofnumber.39We can conclude then that Nicomachus does indeed distinguish between number and true being (the Forms), but in a way that reverses the situation in Plato's Republic, that is, that subordinates Forms to number. This conclusion reinforces rather than resolves the inconsistency detected above. Notonly does it not appear to be true that mathematics prepares for and leads up to a higher (nonmathematical) science ofbeing, but ifthere is to be such a science at all —and it is not clear what would be left for it after the mathematical study ofnumber and its properties —it must be subordinate to mathematics.NICOMACHUS OF GERASA 17 35Cf. anon.

He shows himselfto be interested in such implications, particularly f or physics and ethics,in his Introduction, and the Theologoumena was largely devoted to the matter. I shall discuss ﬁrst the references to physics and ethics in the Introduction. Nicomachus' view ofthe relevance ofnumber to the physical univ erse can easily be inferred from his cosmology: number is namely the model, or paradigm, ofthe universe. Thus the mathematical principle which permits ofderiving forms of inequality from equality 41—a derivation which, Nicomachus insists (66, 1 –2), is not ofhuman contrivance, but a natural, i.e. ‘divine ’process —‘proves ’that inequality in the physical world also derives from equality.42The paradigmatic relation between the world and numbers is such that w hat is true ofnumbers and their properties is also true ofthe structure and processes ofthe world.43 Nicomachus also points out parallels between mathematical and ethical principles. In particular he compares ‘perfect ’, ‘superabundant ’, and ‘deﬁcient’numbers with the (Aristotelian) analysis ofvirtues as ‘means ’and ofvices as ‘excesses ’ and‘deﬁciencies ’. From the context and the language ofsuch comparisons, it appears that the relation between numerical and ethical principles is again paradigmatic. One important passage (65, 8 –16) introduces ethical considerations in the context ofa comparison between numerical principles and the making ofthe world. The virtuouslife is described as an ‘organizing ’18 PYTHAGOREANISM IN THE 2ND AND 3RD CENTURIES AD 40The distinction is not as clearly made as D'Ooge, 98 –9 (under the in ﬂuence ofPhiloponus, In Nic.

As this work was, as I hope to show in the f ollowing chapters, ofconsiderable importance and yet has scarcely been examined as a work in itselfinmodern research, it calls for some attention here. A report going back to late Antiquity refers to it as follows: 46‘You must ﬁrst read this book (i.e. the Introduction ) because it is introductory. For Nicomachus produced another arithmetic entitled The Major Arithmetic orTheologoumena in which he refers47to the present work ’. Leaving aside for the moment the interpretation ofthe second title, Theologoumena, one might note that the ﬁrst title tends to support the suggestion in this text that the Introduction to Arithmetic was intended, as a ‘minor arithmetic ’, to lead and introduce the reader to a major work, the Theologoumena. Nicomachus' own practice in the Introduction goes to some degree in this direction48as does Photius' summary ofthe Theologoumena, in which it is stressed that a long training in mathematics is necessary as preparation for Nicomachus' curious arithmetical theology.49The passage in Photius reminds us again ofthe theme in Plato's Republic ofmathematics as a preparation f or ‘dialectic ’, and, as applicable to the relation between the Introduction and the Theologoumena, strengthens the supposition that Nicomachus could with consistency speak ofthe mathematical sciences as intermediary (in the sense ofPlato's Republic ) and yet consider number as the highest reality, calling for a studyNICOMACHUS OF GERASA 19 4465, 9–12 (noteτὸτη ̑ςψυχη ̑ς...κοσμητικ όνandɛὐτακτηθ ήσονται); cf. anon.

III 47, 145 a 6 –7). 48The physical and ethical applications in the Intro. arith. come at the endofdiscrete mathematical sections which are described as a necessary method ofapproach ( ἔϕοδος, 64, 23 –4) to these applications. 49Bibl.III 41 –2, 143 a; Photius at 142 b 23 describes Nicomachus' Intro. arith. as‘prior’to (πϱὸ) his Theol. arith. : this may indicate the order ofthe works in the manuscript</p><div id="pagenum"><p>he used; cf. Hägg (1975), 160 –1.</p></div><div id="pagenum"><p>crowning mathematics and concerned with the ﬁrst numerical principles ofall reality, a study such as was presented in</p></div><p id="page">theTheologoumena. What did this supreme study consist of? What does ‘Theologoumena ’mean here? We depend for hints of Nicomachus' intentions in the Theologoumena on Photius' report, and Photius is both informative and frustrating. He tells us Nicomachus' work consisted oftwo books dealing with each ofthe ﬁrst ten numbers, Book I with the ﬁrst four numbers, Book II with the remainder.50Each number was discussed (i) in relation to its speci ﬁc mathematical properties and (ii) in relation to various non-mathematical subjects, physical, ethical, and in particular theological. Inreporting on this last aspect ofthe work —it involved references to many pagan deities —Photius adopts the stance ofrighteous indignation appropriate f or such heathen nonsense. 51This helps to obscure things considerably. Yet what he says, ifcombined with some extracts preserved in the other source ofinf ormation about Nicomachus' book, theanonymous Theologoumena, is enough to yield some clues about what Nicomachus was trying to do. Photius indicates (142 b 35 ff.) that Nicomachus assimilated various gods and goddesses to each of the ﬁrst ten numbers, the speci ﬁc quantity ofeach number ( ἰδιάζουσαν ...ποσότητα) being the basis ofsuch identi ﬁcations. Photius attacks Nicomachus' method ofassimilation ( ἀναϕοϱή), charging that he tampered with the speci ﬁc properties ofthe numbers in order to achieve his identi ﬁcations (142 b 22 ff.). Be that as it may, it is clear that Nicomachus' approach involved two phases: (i) setting forth the speci ﬁc mathematical characteristics ofeach number (such as had been at least partially introduced already in the Introduction ), and (ii) using these characteristics20 PYTHAGOREANISM IN THE 2ND AND 3RD CENTURIES AD 50For the Pythagorean there are really only the ﬁrst ten numbers, since all other numbers are constructed out ofthe ﬁrst ten; cf. Nicomachus in anon. Theol. arith. 27, 10 –15; 80, 10; Theon, Exp. 99, 17 –19; Anatolius, De dec. 29, 7–8. Treatises on the ﬁrst ten numbers are common in Pythagorean-type literature, e.g. Anatolius, De dec., Theon, Exp. 99, 17 –106, 11 who refers to a De decade by (Pseudo-) Archytas and to Philolaus, De natura (also a source for Nicomachus; cf. anon. Theol. arith. 74, 10 ff.). One should add also the (Pseudo-) Pythagoras' Sacred Discourse. Cf. Tannery (1885 a), 182 –9; Delatte (1915), 233– 4; Robbins (1921); Staehle (1931), 15 –17, 19 –75; Mansfeld (1971), 157 –9; Thesleff (1965), 164 –6; and below, n. 52. 51Appropriately enough Photius' ecclesiastical censure has been renewed by the modern rationalist. Delatte's description ofthis sort ofsubject, wh ich he terms ‘arithmology ’ (1915, 139), as a mixture of ‘la saine recherche scienti ﬁque’and‘les fantaisies de la religion et de la philosophie ’echoes Photius' judgement ofNicomachus' work as a</p><div id="pagenum"><p>mixture ofthe truth about numbers with ﬁctions dreamed up by an impure mind (143 a 22 –4, 142 b 25 –6).</p></div><div id="pagenum"><p>in order to relate various divinities to each number. Notwithstanding his repugnance for such things, Photiusconcentrates on the second phase, listing some ofthe divinities named by Nicomachus and neglecting the ﬁrst phase</p></div><p id="page">almost completely. A more coherent and balanced view ofNicomachus' method can be gathered f rom the excerpts inthe anonymous Theologoumena. For example, on the subject ofthe monad, a summary ofthe mathematical characteristics ofthe monad is ﬁrst given (1, 4 –2, 17). Various features are stressed: the monad's capacity to generate other numbers without changing in itself(1, 6 –8); its possession in potentiality ofall that appears in actuality in the following numbers, e.g. odd and even (1, 9 ff.; 3, 2 ff.); its uni ﬁcatory property. 52These features, demonstrated in mathematical fashion of the monad, allow Nicomachus then to identify it with god (3, 1 ff.), with intellect, and with thedemiurge as an organizing, productive principle (4, 1 –2; 4, 9 –12). The rationale ofNicomachus' work disappears in Photius' irate enumeration ofpagan divinities. In his Theologoumena Nicomachus attempted then, it seems, to deepen and justify, through exploration of the mathematical prop erties ofnumbers, the simple assimilations and identi ﬁcations common in the Pythagorean tradition between various numbers and assorted gods (and other objects) whose naïvetéhad long since exposed Pythagoreanism to ridicule. 53Thus the Pythagorean saying that ‘Justice is ﬁve’entailed for Nicomachus a long exploration ofthe mathematical characteristics ofthe pentad in which the basis oftheidenti ﬁcation would emerge. As the Pythagorean tradition had related numbers not only to deities, but also to other subjects —indeed a venerable Pythagorean saying has it that ‘all is likened unto number ’ 54—so in his Theologoumena Nicomachus is concerned with ethical and physical (see above, nn. 37 –8) as well as with theological assimilations. It seems then thatNICOMACHUS OF GERASA 21 522, 18–19. These ﬁrst pages ofthe anon. Theol. arith. include some glossing by a Neoplatonic editor ofmaterial which is however essentially Nicomachean; cf . Burkert (1972), 98, and above, n. 24. 53See the decadic works listed above, n. 43. In an interesting passage quoted from Moderatus in Porphyry, Vit. Pyth. ch. 48, 58, 21 ff. (cf. above, n. 8), it seems Moderatus claimed that the Pythagoreans used the numbers ofthe decad διδασκαλ ίαςχάϱιν, to convey higher, more dif ﬁcult ideas, namely the Forms and ﬁrst principles. This suggests that by the ﬁrst century ADPythagorean decadic literature had fallen into such disrepute that Moderatus felt obliged to defend it as being designed for simpler minds and as symbolic ofhigher realities. Nicomachus' apologia is quite different and more faithful to this Pythagorean literature.</p><div id="pagenum"><p>54ἀϱιθμῳ̑δέτɛπάντ ′ἐπέοικɛν; cf.

But whatis the relation between numbers and deities? To judge by the approach he takes, it seems that Nicomachus regards theproliferating Greek pantheon as a manner of referring to numbers; hisgods and goddesses are the monad, dyad, triad. Or, as Photius expressed it, Nicomachus sought to make the numbers gods. 56 The conclusion that I believe emerges from all this as regards the problem of consistency raised towards the beginningof this section is the following: mathematics, in particular arithmetic, functions for Nicomachus, as for Plato's Republic, as an introductory and mediatory study. In contrast to the Republic, however, Nicomachus does not regard the objectsof arithmetic, numbers, their properties and laws, as intermediary between sensibles and Forms. Numbers are, on thecontrary, the principles ofthe Forms, the Forms being no more than the properties or characters ofnumbers. Therethen seems little room for the ‘highest study ’, dialectic, ofthe Republic in Nicomachus' system. Is it replaced by another ultimate science? What does the study ofarithmetic lead to? To a command ofthe theory ofnumbers, one mustsuppose, such that the numerical structure underlying physical laws, ethical principles, and religious systems becomesclear. Such command, to the degree that it approximates to the numbers which produced the universe, couldappropriately be described as a divine science. 57 In comparison then with Numenius, it appears that Nicomachus, as a Pythagoreanizing Platonist, did go so far as tomathematize Platonic philosophy completely, replacing dialectic and the Forms with some22PYTHAGOREANISM IN THE 2ND AND 3RD CENTURIES AD 55Note the ‘they’in Photius' report (e.g. 143 a 39, 143 b 23, 144 a 4), i.e. the Pythagoreans as referred to by Nicomachus. 56Cf. Photius, 142 b 32 –7; 143 a 10. 57One wonders what the relation might be between the divine demiurge and the decad that he uses as model (cf. anon. Theol. arith. 57, 21 –58, 7; 32, 11 –12), especially in view ofNicomachus' identi ﬁcation ofthe monad as demiurge.

However more recent studies have suggested an earlier date for Iamblichus' birth (245 orbefore), which would make it possible to have Iamblichus working under Anatolius before the latter became bishop inthe 270s. 60‘We should not multiply Anatolii unnecessarily ’: Dillon's Plotinian principle seems reasonable. Perhaps some slight support in favour of the identi ﬁcation ofIamblichus' teacher with the f uture bishop —and there are no strong arguments against it —is the fact that both Iamblichus and the future bishop had Pythagorean mathematical interests. For similar reasons we may suppose that it is again the same Anatolius to whom is attributed a work On the Decad which has survived both independently and in the form of excerpts included with extracts from Nicomachus'Theologoumena in the anonymous Theologoumena arithmeticae. In view oftheir common Pythagorean mathematical interests, one would like to know much more about Iamblichus'teacher than can be gathered from the little evidence about Anatolius that we have. The excerpts from the Arithmetical Introductions edited by Hultsch showANATOLIUS 23 58Eunapius, Vit. soph. 363; Porphyry dedicated a work to an Anatolius ( Quaest. Hom. ad Il. 281, 2; cf. Schraeder's discussion in his edition, 347 –8). 59Eusebius, Hist. Eccles. II 726, 6 –9; ten books: a good Pythagorean number; Moderatus' work on the Pythagoreans may also have been in ten books; cf.

He also stressed the scienti ﬁc character (τὸἐπιστημονικ όν) ofPythagorean</p></div><p id="page">arithmetic and geometry, a character achieved through restricting the objects studied to those that are eternal,immaterial, and unchanging. 61The similarities with the opening pages ofNicomachus' Introduction to Arithmetic are striking and point either to a dependence ofAnatolius on Nicomachus or, more likely, to a source concerningPythagoreanism used by both. Anatolius notes furthermore the importance of number to the Pythagoreans and quotesthe saying that ‘All is likened unto number ’(279, 20 –2). But from such meagre remains it is not possible to extract anything certain about how Anatolius himselfviewed Pythagoras, Pythagoras' place in the history ofphilosophy, andthe relation between Pythagorean mathematics and philosophy.Anatolius' work On the Decad offers only slightly more scope. Each of the ﬁrst ten numbers is treated with respect to its mathematical characteristics and to the various epithets associated with it in the Pythagorean tradition. In the latter partofhis treatment Anatolius does little more than list the various items by which each number was ‘named ’, or to which each number was ‘likened ’(ɛἰκάζοντ ɛς,ὁμοιου ̑ντες) by the Pythagoreans. For example, the monad is likened to ‘The One, the intelligible god, the ungenerated, the beautiful itself, the good itself ’. 62Anatolius does not explore however what the basis or signi ﬁcance ofsuch assimilations might be. Is the monad ‘like’the One because it produces all numbers, or is it rather itselfthe ultimate source ofeverything, which is also ref erred to as ‘god’or‘the One ’?T h ev e r y close verbal parallels between this and many other passages in Anatolius' work and the section on the decad in TheonofSmyrna's Exposition ofmathematics (written in the second century AD) show that Anatolius is merely summarizing the traditional Pythagorean decadic literature also used by Theon63and which Nicomachus had tried, in his Theologoumena, to clarify and deepen. Anatolius does refer several times to Plato's Timaeus (33, 13 ff.; 36, 28 ff.; 40, 1 ff. and 14 ff.), thus introducing the notion that the universe and the soul are produced from number. But this is not used as a generalbasis for justifying the Pythagorean assimilations of numbers to other items. The impression conveyed by theassimilations is rather one off airly arbitrary and24PYTHAGOREANISM IN 2ND AND 3RD CENTURIES AD 61Excerpta 277, 8 –14. 6229, 19 –22 (cf.

The work represents then a regression compared to the writings ofNicomachus and even (twocenturies earlier) ofModeratus. It is possible, however, that Anatolius' On the Decad is in fact a version of a much earlier</p></div><p id="page">Pythagorean writing 64which came, in some way, to be associated with Anatolius. At any rate it would be imprudent to use it alone (and there is not suf ﬁcient evidence otherwise) as a basis for attempting a reconstruction of Anatolius' own philosophical views. 4.Porphyry In the ﬁnal section ofthis chapter it will hardly be possible to do much more than note some aspects ofthe work of Plotinus' great pupil Porphyry. Porphyry's interests and learning were so wide, and so little ofhis work has survived,that it is in any event hardly possible to produce an adequate account ofhim. The necessary scholarly work has yet tobe done, namely an exhaustive collection of, and critical commentary on, the surviving fragments and testimonia relating to Porphyry. 65Yet he cannot be omitted. Iamblichus studied under him.66They became involved in polemics with each other. Porphyry criticized Iamblichus in his book on the Delphic oracle ‘Know thyself ’;67Iamblichus replied at length in his On Mysteries to Porphyry's Letter to Anebo and also appears to have accused Porphyry ofbeing ‘full of Numenius ’.68This dif ﬁcult relationship indicates the importance ofPorphyry to Iamblichus and makes one suspect that perhaps they were, after all, closer to each other in their ideas than either of them would be prepared to admit.An incomplete Life of Pythagoras by Porphyry is still extant. The Lifewas once part ofthe ﬁrst book ofa Philosophical History in four books beginning with Homer and ending with Plato which is otherwise, apart from some short extracts, lost. 69It is therefore not easy to seePORPHYRY 25 64From which the names ofpagan gods have been purged; cf . above, n. 43. 65For Porphyry's range cf. Beutler (1953), 278 –301 (an edition ofselected f ragments ofPorphyry is to be published by A. Smith). Problems in the reconstruction of Porphyry's intellectual development cannot be treated here. 66Eunapius, Vit. soph. 363; cf. Dillon (1973), 10 –11. 67In Stobaeus, Anth. III 579, 6 –580, 1. 68Above, p. 10; Dillon (1973), 10, and Saffrey (1971), who show how much of Iamblichus' work consists of responses to speci ﬁc writings by Porphyry.</p><div id="pagenum"><p>69Cf.

Nor is it even clear what Porphyry's own attitude to Pythagoras is in</p></div><p id="page">theLife.The Lifereads like a learned compilation ofsource materials concerning Pythagoras. The stories about Pythagoras' education among the Egyptians and Chaldaeans are repeated. The Jews, Arabs, Phoenicians, andZoroaster are also named as educators. Py thagoras' philosophy emerges as an elementary sort ofPlatonism involving the search f or wisdom, namely knowledge ofimmaterial realities, through liberation ofthe mind f rom itsimprisonment in the body. 70 More can be learnt about Porphyry's views on Pythagoras f rom the remnants ofsome ofPorphyry's other books. InhisPhilosophy from Oracles, Porphyry expressed the intention to present philosophical doctrines, as these had been divinely communicated to man in oracles. Such a book, he felt, would be welcomed by those who, ‘in labour ’ 71after truth, have prayed for the rest from intellectual perplexity ( ἀποϱία) that a divine revelation could give (110, 1 –7). The ‘philosophy ’expounded by Porphyry on the basis ofthe oracles he had collected seems to have been primarily religious: it concerned the nature and order ofthe gods and the rites and objects appropriate to their cult.72In his Letter to an Egyptian priest, Anebo, Porphyry sought from Egyptian doctrines about the divine a broader philosophy. He hadno doubts about the existence ofgods, 73but found the Egyptian doctrines logically inconsistent and was also unclear about their views on the structure ofreality: What do the Egyptians think the ﬁrst cause is? Is it Intellect or above Intellect? Is it alone, or with another or others? Is it incorporeal or corporeal? Is it identical with the demiurge, or prior to the demiurge? Are all thingsderived from one or from many? Do they know of matter or primary qualitative bodies, and is matter ungeneratedor generated? 74 It would not be easy to give a more concise list ofthe major questions debated by Platonists in the second and thirdcenturies AD. What is more relevant here is that Porphyry expected the divinely revealed26 PYTHAGOREANISM IN 2ND AND 3RD CENTURIES AD 70Chs. 46 –7, 57, 22 –58, 20; cf. Segonds in the edition, 162 –8. 71Y3kδίναντɛς: Plato's metaphor (e.g. Symp. 206 e 1). 72Cf. Wolff (edition), 42 –3; Bidez (1913), 17 ff. Cf. also, however, J. O'Meara (1959), 29 –31. Porphyry's introductory words lead one to expect a philosophy broader in scope than that found in the fragments preserved in Eusebius. 73Porphyry, Ep. ad An., Sodano's introduction, xviii.</p><div id="pagenum"><p>7422, 11 –23, 3 (= Iamblichus, De myst. 260, 4 –10); I have put the passage into direct speech.</p></div><div id="pagenum"><p>teachings ofthe Egyptian priesthood to provide a Platonic philosophy that was logically consistent and complete.75</p></div><p id="page">This expectation, it appears, was not ful ﬁlled, at least at the time the Letterwas written. It looks also as ifPorphyry expected to ﬁnd such a philosophy in other religions and in the sayings ofancient sages, if we can judge by his interpretation ofa Homeric passage in Ofthe Cave ofthe Nymphs. Porphyry here attempts to recover the views ofthe ‘ancients ’(Op. sel. 57, 17 –24), not only those ofHomer, but also those ofZoroaster, Orpheus, and other ancient ‘theologians ’,76and ofphilosophers such as Pythagoras and Plato. What is f ound is again a basic Platonic philosophy: Homer's cave ofthe nymphs symbolizes the sensible world into which the soul has descended and f romwhich it must escape. Pythagoras is thus a member ofa great assembly ofancient prophets, theologians, sages,philosophers, and poets in whom Porphyry sought to discover the same, namely Platonic, philosophy. According totheLetterto Anebo, this philosophy was communicated through such channels to mankind by the gods. Certain conclusions follow from this with respect to Porphyry's view of Pythagoras. As in Numenius (who is cited byPorphyry in Ofthe Cave ofthe Nymphs ), Pythagoras is regarded by Porphyry as essentially a Platonic philosopher whose views can be corroborated by reference to various oriental religions. However, and here I believe Porphyry differsfrom Numenius, Pythagoras loses some of his prominence as he joins a vast chorus of voices from the past and fromdifferent religions and cultures all giving expression to a divinely revealed philosophy. Porphyry, then, is not aPythagoreanizing Platonist, i.e. one who singles Pythagoras out as the fountainhead of all true (Platonic) philosophy,but rather a universalizing Platonist: he ﬁnds his Platonism both in Pythagoras and in very many other quarters. These conclusions are consistent with what emerges from the most extensive work of Porphyry to have survived, On Abstinence.Towards the beginning ofthis work, Porphyry ref ers to a certain Clodius ofNaples who had criticized vegetarianism. 77 Clodius f ound Pythagoras at the origin ofvegetarianism and saw the Pythagorean theories ofthe kinship andtransmigration ofsouls as argumentsPORPHYRY 27 75Iamblichus, De myst. 96, 5–10, criticizes Porphyry for having an approach that is ϕιλοσόϕωςμα ̑λλονκα ὶλογικω ̑ς. 76Orpheus (68, 1), Homer (78, 15 –16); Plato is distinguished from the ‘theologians ’at 71, 17 (cf. 77, 22).</p><div id="pagenum"><p>77Cf. Bouffartigue and Patillon's introduction to their edition, I 25 –9 (Clodius: a teacher ofMark Antony?).</p></div><div id="pagenum"><p>supporting the abstention from eating meat.78It is noteworthy, however, that Porphyry, in setting out to argue for</p></div><p id="page">abstention, does not con ﬁne himselfto a def ence ofPythagoras and ofPythagorean doctrine. His approach is f ar broader in scope, bringing into play an extraordinary command ofthe history ofGreek philosophy and ofthe literatureon oriental peoples in order to establish a general context in which abstention from meat can be seen to be desirable.This context, not surprisingly, is the plight ofthe soul imprisoned in the body and whose desire f or knowledge andfelicity can only be satis ﬁed in a liberation from the body and an ascent to the immaterial and divine. All distraction, all drawing away ofthe soul's concentration on the immaterial world, must be avoided. The vegetarian diet is theref oredesirable: in contrast to a diet ofmeat, it demands the minimum ofattention f rom the soul, since it is inexpensive toprocure, simple to prepare and unexciting! 79(Porphyry would prefer that we do away with food altogether, but this conﬂicts (I 72) with his disapproval ofsuicide.) Pythagoras, various sages, and Plato are identi ﬁed with these views,80as are Egyptian, Jewish, Persian, and Indian sects whose practices, as documented in Book IV, support Porphyry's thesis.Thus Pythagoras, in On Abstinence, tends again to be integrated into a very large group ofauthorities and nations, and Pythagorean vegetarianism becomes part ofa philosophy assumed to be attested in all these sources, namely a Platonicmetaphysical and ethical otherworldliness. 81 Ifthese inf erences about Porphyry's views on Pythagoras are correct, we might be led to conclude also that he wouldnot have felt any need to give particular stress to the Pythagorean mathematical sciences. The evidence, such as it is,tends to bear this out. In the Life of Pythagoras Porphyry does refer to the mediatory role that can be played by the mathematical sciences: they can bridge the gap for us between the material and the immaterial (Ch. 47, 58, 12 –19). Their possible puri ﬁcatory function is mentioned very brie ﬂyi n On Abstinence (I ch. 29, 64), where Porphyry also provides a short summary ofPythagorean ‘arithmology ’(II ch. 36, 102). None the less, what survives ofPorphyry's writings gives the impression that in general he28PYTHAGOREANISM IN 2ND AND 3RD CENTURIES AD 78I ch. 15, 3, 55; ch. 18, 1 and 19, 1, 56. 79I chs. 30 –2; 46. With some irony Porphyry notes that those arch-hedonists, the Epicureans, followed the simple diet suitable to the Platonic soul (I chs. 48 ff.). 80I ch. 36; Clodius had tried to dissociate Socrates and his followers from Pythagorean vegetarianism (I ch. 15).</p><div id="pagenum"><p>81Porphyry returns in Book III to the kinship ofsouls, which is understood in a Platonic way.</p></div><div id="pagenum"><p>is more concerned with ethical and religious than with mathematical means ofascending to the immaterial. A goodexample ofthis can be f ound in his Life of Plotinus. Dörrie has attempted (1955) to construct a Pythagorean personality</p></div><p id="page">for Plotinus' teacher Ammonius from aspects of Plotinus' life as presented by Porphyry. It is more prudent however totake Porphyry's account as constituting to some degree a portrait ofthe ideal philosopher. Indeed in the LifePlotinus shows many ofthe f eatures ofthe true philosopher sketched in On Abstinence : 82he abstains from meat,83indeed eating hardly anything, such is his rapt concentration on the higher world;84he demonstrates extraordinary purity and freedom from distraction by this world (23, 1 ff.); he turns people away from political life (7, 32 –5); he has, or at least seeks, relations with oriental peoples, priests, and even gods and demons, so much so in fact that his work, Porphyryasserts, is divinely inspired. 85Most signi ﬁcantly for us, however, he concerns himself little with arithmetic and geometry, although Porphyry is anxious at the same time to claim that he is not ignorant ofsuch matters (14, 8 –10). It is to some extent true that Plotinus had no special devotion to mathematics. But it is noteworthy that this trait persistsin a portrait ofPlotinus which Porphyry tends to paint in the image ofan ideal philosopher who exhibits otherwise anumber of ‘Pythagorean ’features. 86PORPHYRY 29 82De abst. I chs. 27 –28; II chs. 49 –52, 114 –16; Bouffartigue and Patillon's introductions I 33; II 48 –9 (nothing the Plotinian themes in these passages). 83Vit.

I ch. 39; Bouffartigue and Pataillon's introduction I 34 –5). 85Vit. Plot. 23, 20 –1 (see Armstrong's note ad loc. in his transl.). I do not wish to deny that someofthis may have been true ofPlotinus. But what is signi ﬁcant for us here is what Porphyry chose to record and the way he recorded it. 86Porphyry's breaking up and arrangement ofPlotinus' treatises into six sets ofnine (‘ Enneads’ ) is the most striking example ofhis imposition ofPythagoreanism on Plotinus. To some ofthe Pythagorean traits already noted might be added the vow ofsecrecy made by Plotinus and some f ellow-pupils ofAmmonius ( Vit. Plot. 3, 24–7). Cf. L. Brisson et al.(1982), 254 –6. Further traces of ‘Pythagoreanizing ’in Porphyry may survive in Augustine's De ordine. Having shown (II ch. X, 28 ff.) the numerical basis of the seven liberal arts and the role ofthe mathematical sciences in leading the soul to philosophy, Augustine relates this to Pythagoras, who is praise d quite emphatically (xx, 53). I. Hadot (1984), 101– 36, argues that Augustine is using a Neoplatonic source which she identi ﬁes hypothetically as Porphyry's De regressu animae. Ifshe proves the Neoplatonic character ofAugustine's theory ofthe liberal arts and the presence in particular ofPorphyrian themes, it would also be necessary to sho w that Porphyry was Augustine's onlysource before Augustine could be used with con ﬁdence as a witness for Porphyry.

Thisprogramme surpassed its predecessors in its comprehensive and systematic quality and succeeded, as I shall attempt toshow in Part Two, in playing a decisive role in the history oflater Greek philosophy. It will be necessary, however, ﬁrst to examine Iamblichus' Pythagoreanizing programme in some deta il. Traces ofit can be f ound in reports concerning Iamblichus' lost commentaries on Plato and on Aristotle and in the surviving remains ofother more systematicwritings. But the most accessible expression ofthe programme is the multi-volume work Iamblichus devotedspeciﬁcally to the theme, On Pythagoreanism. When Iamblichus wrote this work, or when more generally his Pythagoreanizing programme was developed, is unclear. I shall give grounds below (pp. 91 ff.) for not accepting anearly date for the work. It and the programme to which it belongs and which appears also in the commentaries onPlato and Aristotle ought to be dated in all likelihood to the time when Iamblichus had already left Porphyry (probablywell before the end of the third century) and had set up his own philosophical school in Syria, in Apamea, and/or inDaphne. 87 In Chapter 4 the traces ofa Pythagoreanizing programme that can be f ound in what little has survived ofIamblichus'many other philosophical writings will be examined. An obvious point ofdeparture however is provided by the workOn Pythagoreanism. This work has been transmitted to us by one manuscript, ‘F’(fourteenth century), from which all of the later manuscript copies derive. 88Manuscript 87On the evidence and problems concerning Iamblichus' biography cf. Dillon (1973), 4 –14; although the evidence that Iamblichus was Porphyry's pupil is not conclusive, so much points in this direction that Dillon simply assumes this (correctly, I believe) as a fact.</p><div id="pagenum"><p>88The importance ofF (Florence, Laur. 86, 3) has been demonstrated by Pistelli (1888).</p></div><div id="pagenum"><p>F begins with a Table ofContents ( pinax) listing the titles ofnine books constituting the work. The pinaxis followed,</p></div><p id="page">however, by the ﬁrst four books only. The remaining books have since disappeared. We may suppose that this might easily have happened ifthe work had been transmitted bound in two volumes (codices) ofwhich the second,containing the last ﬁve books ofthe work, came to be mislaid or ignored. 89The loss ofthe last ﬁve books occurred at any rate after the eleventh century, when the Byzantine polymath Michael Psellus was still able to read and makeexcerpts from Books V– VII. This process ofdismemberment ofIamblichus' work, begun thus negligently enough, was completed with true philological furor in the last one hundred years. The surviving ﬁrst four books of the work were published as ifseparate, independent works; and Deubner, in his edition ofthe ﬁrst book, On the Pythagorean Life (1937), even neglected to print the pinaxfor the work as a whole, which helps us relate On the Pythagorean Life to the following books making up the work. The dismemberment was carried out most diligently, however, within each oftheﬁrst three books: each was ransacked for what could be extracted from it of lost writings by (or on) Pythagoreans, Aristotle, Speusippus . . . A silent decapitation ﬁnally resulted from a lack of serious interest even in what the title of the work as a whole might be. 90 In this chapter I shall try to restore some unity to Iamblichus' work, beginning with its title and overall plan andproceeding through the ﬁrst four books considered to the extent to which they relate to an overall plan. In Chapter 3, the excerpts in Psellus from Books V –VII ofthe work will be analysed and will lead to some general conclusions in the following chapter concerning the purpose and signi ﬁcance ofIamblichus' work, its relation to traces ofa Pythagoreanizing programme in his other works, and to the varieties ofPythagoreanism presented in Chapter 1.In examining below the ﬁrst four books of On Pythagoreanism I shall be concerned more with the waysin which Iamblichus understood and used the Pythagorean (and other) materials he assembled in composing these books, thanwith the materials themselves; more with his intentions, than with his sources. 91IAMBLICHUS' ON PYTHAGOREANISM 31 89For other cases cf.

(iii) Pythagorean Commentaries (Πυθαγ όϱɛιαὑπομνήματα), a title which is found also in manuscript F.93 Which ofthese three titles should be used?The third title has the least authority for it and in any case is not a formal title, but a loose description. This latter pointis true also of the second title, as can be seen from the fact that Syrianus refers by means of it to the writings ofIamblichus and ofNicomachus ( In met. 103, 6 –7): again a loose description, not a title. The ﬁrst title has the strongest authority for it, both manuscript F and Syrianus.A possible objection to adopting the ﬁrst title as the right one is that ‘sect’(αἵϱɛσις) is too restrictive: Iamblichus' work covered not only the Pythagorean sect but also (and especially) its doctrines and sciences. Ifthis point can apply to theEnglish word ‘sect’, it cannot hold for the Greek term αἵϱɛσιςwhich had already, some centuries before Iamblichus, come to signify, not only the members of a religious or philosophical movement, but also the doctrines and theories ofthe movement. 94Such is the meaning of αὶϱɛσιςalso in Iamblichus95in a passage, for example, at the beginning of the Protreptic (i.e. the second book of the work under consideration) which also provides further authority for the ﬁrst title: In the preceding we have said what is appropriate about Pythagoras, about his kind oflif e and about thePythagoreans.

To avoid the misleading connotations ofthe word ‘sect’I shall translate the Greek title as On Pythagoreanism so as to include both the personalities concerned and their theories.It is less easy to determine whether Iamblichus' On Pythagoreanism was originally made up ofnine or often books. The pinaxin manuscript F lists nine books. However, at the end ofthe f ourth and last surviving book ( In Nic. 125, 19 –24) Iamblichus mentions the subjects he will cover later, namely music (= Book IX), geometry (= Book VIII), andastronomy. As there is no book devoted to the last subject in the list ofnine books given in the pinax, it is reasonable to infer that a tenth book was (or was to have been) devoted to it. In any case his work, written in true Pythagorean spirit,should have contained ten books, even ifit did not. It probably once did. 96 The titles ofthe books ofOn Pythagoreanism as given in the pinaxare: I On the Pythagorean Life( II Protreptic to Philosophy(Πϱοτϱɛπτικὸςἐπὶϕιλοσοϕίαν) III On General Mathematical Science( ) IV On Nicomachus' Arithmetical Introduction( ) V On Arithmetic in Physical Matters( ) VI On Arithmetic in Ethical Matters( ) VII On Arithmetic in Theological Matters( 97  ) VIII On Pythagorean Geometry( )TITLE AND OVERALL PLAN 33 96Cf. above, ch. 1 n. 52; Larsen (1972), I 44 –5.</p><div id="pagenum"><p>97Nauck's correction ofthe reading θεοι ̑ςin F, supported by In Nic. 125, 14 –25 quoted below.</p></div><div id="pagenum"><p>IX On Pythagorean Music(</p></div><p id="page">) To this list we should probably add then a tenth and ﬁnal book: X On Pythagorean Astronomy. It has already been noted that ofthe whole work only the ﬁrst four books are extant, together with excerpts from Books V –VII. The unity ofplan underlying the sequence ofbooks will be brought out below in a detailed examination ofthesurviving books and fragments. However, it will be useful at this stage to propose an overall scheme for On Pythagoreanism as this emerges from combining the book titles of the pinaxwith programmatic passages in Books II and IV. 98 In the passage quoted above from the beginning of the Protreptic Iamblichus moves from his account of Pythagoras, Pythagorean life, and the Pythagoreans in On the Pythagorean Life to a general preparation, presented in the Protreptic, for ‘all education, learning, and virtue ’(6, 15 –16). This general preparation is intended as a stage leading the reader to a more speci ﬁcally Pythagorean philosophy and science introduced at the end ofthe Protreptic and in the following books: As the soul progresses gradually from lesser to greater things ...a n d ﬁnally ﬁnds the most perfect goods, thus the turning〈ofthe soul 〉(πϱοτϱοπή) must progress along a route starting from what is general and common ( τω ̑ν κοινω ̑ν). (Pr.7, 8–12) The succession ofbooks in Iamblichus' work is thus related to a pedagogical progression f rom the general andcommon to what is more dif ﬁcult, higher, and speci ﬁcally Pythagorean. The progression is a ‘protreptic ’: it is designed to lead the soul up to ‘greater things ’. The protreptic function is not only evident in the Protreptic itself: it will also be seen below to be present already in the ﬁrst book, On the Pythagorean Life. A second programmatic passage is found at the end of Book IV. Having presented in this book an introduction toarithmetic based on Nicomachus, Iamblichus gives a foretaste of what is to come: We will study such other consequences as arise from the numbers, from the monad up to the decad, orderingmatters according to a physical ( ϕυσικός),34 IAMBLICHUS' ON PYTHAGOREANISM</p><div id="pagenum"><p>98Cf.

I) General and Pythagorean Philosophy: Protreptic (Bk. II) Introduction to Pythagorean Mathematics : General Mathematical Science (Bk. III)Arithmetic in itself: Nicomachus (Bk. IV) in Physics (Bk. V)in Ethics (Bk. VI)in Theology (Bk. VII) Geometry (Bk. VIII)Music (Bk. IX)Astronomy (Bk. X) This scheme may serve as a rough sketch, to be ﬁlled in as Iamblichus' project is examined in detail in the following pages. 2.Pythagoras(BookI:OnthePythagoreanLife) Theﬁrst chapter ofthe ﬁrst book can be regarded as a prologue to the work as a whole and is introduced as such in the chapter-headings ( κɛϕάλαια) preserved in manuscript F.100It is an invocation ofdivine help, a traditional motifin Platonic literature inspired by Plato'sPYTHAGORAS (BOOK I) 35 99In Nic. 125, 14 –25 (expanding on 118, 11 –19); cf. 3, 13 ff. I shall return to this passage in the next chapter. The book on music is also referred to at 121, 13; 122, 12. 100Cf.Vit. Pyth. 1, 3. Theκɛϕάλαιαare very probably composed by Iamblichus himself: they are used by Syrianus, In met. 101, 29 –102, 34 (=κɛϕάλαιαforComm. 3, 6–8, 4).</p><div id="pagenum"><p>Cf.

The invocation of the gods is all the more necessary at the outsetofhis work in that the philosophy named af ter Pythagoras is revealed by the gods and can only be grasped throughtheir mediation (5, 4 –9): it is superior to a vision such as that in Plato's Symposium (210 e 4) which can be ‘glimpsed in a ﬂash’(5, 10 –11), because it transcends (mere) human capacities. 102Hence our need to entrust ourselves (5, 14) to divine guidance through which, alone, we can have access to Pythagorean philosophy. The divine guide thatIamblichus proposes to adopt is Pythagoras himself. But what does Iamblichus mean here by ‘divine guidance ’? How is it realized in the chapters on Pythagoras' life that follow?Iamblichus' biography of Pythagoras adheres fairly closely to the guidelines for writing encomia prescribed by the ancient rhetoricians. To praise a hero or prominent citizen one should extol his race, fatherland, education, virtues, andthe great deeds stemming from these virtues; physical excellences should also be praised; transitions between sectionsshould be clearly marked. 103Iamblichus follows all of these prescriptions —he was after all a rhetorician in his own right104—marshalling the various source-materials available to him so as to ﬁt them into the required compositional structure.105To discover, however, the relation between the encomium ofPythagoras and Pythagoras' f unction as ‘divine guide ’, one must examine some signi ﬁcant texts in detail. Commenting on the story that Pythagoras was fathered by Apollo, Iamblichus not only tells us that we ought notbelieve it (7, 26 –7); he also provides an interpretation ofPythagoras' divine parentage which is f ar less corporeal in emphasis:36IAMBLICHUS' ON PYTHAGOREANISM 101Tim. 27c; compare Numenius, fr. 11, 9 –10; Proclus, Theol.

(7, 27 –8, 4) The interest ofthis text increases ifit is noticed that Iamblichus is interpreting the divine origin and mission ofPythagoras in terms ofthe myth in Plato's Phaedrus (246 e –248 c), in which souls follow in the retinue or army (στϱατία) ofgods and demons, Zeus leading ( ἡγɛμών), around the rim ofthe heavens. Each soul is assigned as companion (συνοπαδός) to one ofthe gods in the retinue (which includes ofcourse Apollo), a relation that marks the particular aspirations ofthe soul (253 b). By ref erring to the myth ofthe Phaedrus Iamblichus is providing a context for the understanding ofthe traditional belief s in Pythagoras' divinity which attenuates considerably their literal, materialistpoint-of-view 106by stressing the divine origin ofPythagoras' soul,Pythagoras' spiritual rather than bodily genealogy. Pythagoras' bodily origin is a sign of, but not identical with, his divinity.107At the same time the reference to the Phaedrus helps to distinguish Pythagoras' soul from other, ordinary souls. In the Phaedrus the soul is represented as struggling to keep its place in the celestial retinue and losing it through its own de ﬁciencies. Pythagoras, however, is not a fallen soul, but a soul sent down into the material world. He is in fact, it is suggested some pages later, the bearer of a divine gift for the improvement of human life, i.e. philosophy, a gift such as ‘none better has been or will ever be given by the gods ’(18, 5 –10)—the text is taken this time from Plato's Timaeus (47 b 1 –2). Iamblichus' use ofthemes in the Phaedrus and in the Timaeus thus provides a Platonic framework for the explanation of the divine origin and mission of Pythagoras: in respect to his origin, the superior af ﬁliation ofhis soul with the intelligible realm is stressed; as f or his mission among men, it is to mediate Plato's ‘divine gift ’ofphilosophy, a mediation, one may inf er, made possible by the superior intelligible nature ofPythagoras' soul (cf . 18, 16 –19, 10). The notion that certain wise men have been sent by the gods to enlighten mankind and that philosophy itselfis a divinegift is by noPYTHAGORAS (BOOK I) 37 106Cf. also 54, 5 –14; 79, 11 –17. 107For another interpretation (showing little awareness ofthe philosophical background) cf . Cox (1983), 60 –1. One can suppose that Pythagoras' noble birth is witness to his</p><div id="pagenum"><p>divine soul on the Platonic grounds that each soul is received in an appropriate body; cf. Proclus, In Tim. I 51, 20 –30; In Remp. II 118, 5 ff.</p></div><div id="pagenum"><p>means new in the third century.108The Platonic background to this notion in Iamblichus' On the Pythagorean Life can be</p></div><p id="page">detected in the way that the notion represents an interpretation ofthe Phaedrus and Timaeus. More information on this interpretation can be found elsewhere, notably in the surviving fragments of Iamblichus' De anima. In this work Iamblichus discussed, among other things, the reasons for soul's descent into the material world. Plotinus had raisedthe issue before, in connection with the interpretation of the two Platonic dialogues ( Ennead IV 8, 1). The dialogues seemed to disagree, the Timaeus suggesting that soul had a constructive mission in the world, to vivify, organize, and perfect it, the Phaedrus intimating, however, that soul, due to some sort of moral failure, had fallen from the heavenly retinue ofthe gods and was plunged in a lif e ofmisery in the body. Plotinus attempted to reconcile these two ways ofseeing soul's descent to the material world, stressing initially the positive constructive view, but also allowing for amoral failure and fall of soul. Whatever the degree of the fall, however, Plotinus insisted that soul always retained inpart its presence in the intelligible world from which it came —an original and notorious theory often rejected by his successors. 109Iamblichus, in particular, chose instead in his De anima to distinguish between different sortsofsoul: those souls who are in close contemplative union with true intelligible being and are companions of( συνοπαδο ί) and akin to the gods, and those souls who, already before the descent to the material world, are morally corrupt. On descent to thebody the former can preserve their freedom and purity ( ἀκήϱατοι) from the body. 110This type ofdescent corresponds to the ﬁrst reason for descent that Iamblichus gives, namely to purify, perfect, and thus ‘save’the material world, a task that does not seem to imply loss ofpurity ( ἄχϱαντος) in the soul concerned. The other reasons for descent, moral improvement and punishment, correspond rather to the second kind ofsoul, that which is already bef ore the descentmorally fallen. In this latter type of descent, the38IAMBLICHUS' ON PYTHAGOREANISM 108Cf. Hyldahl (1966), 130 –6; van Winden (1971), 46, citing Lucian, Justin Martyr, Origen.

The general context is the problem posed by Plato's dialogues concerning the purpose ofsoul in the material world. In Iamblichus' view,Pythagoras' soul is one ofthose pure souls that are companions ofthe gods and that have access to knowledge ofintelligible truths. Pythagoras' soul is sent down: his is a mission ofsalvation, through the knowledge he cancommunicate, to the other sorts ofsoul, who have f allen and, plunged in the illusions ofmaterial existence, haveforgotten their origin and true nature. 112For such souls, apparently unable to save themselves, Pythagoras plays a reforming and saving role, revealing to them the divine wisdom to which he is privy.Iamblichus' interpretation ofPythagoras provides a means ofdetermining the purpose ofhis encomiastic biography ofPythagoras, at least in its earlier chapters. The wondrous stories ofPythagoras' birth, education, and travels constitute,not a biographical narrative, but an accumulation ofevidences and signs, recognized by those that witnessed them, ofPythagoras' unique relation to the divine, his privileged access to intelligible truths, and his soteriological mission. ThePythagorean legend, in serving to recommend to the reader Pythagoras' special claim to divine insight, also promotesthat insight, namely the philosophy and sciences associated with Pythagoras. In short, On the Pythagorean Life is a protreptic to Pythagorean philosophy through an illustration ofthe spiritual credentials ofthe f ounder ofthatphilosophy.The later chapters accomplish somewhat more. This can be indicated by means ofa passage concerning the speeches,so full of trite moralisms, that Pythagoras is supposed to have made to the youths of Croton.PYTHAGORAS (BOOK I) 39 111Iamblichus, De an. in Stobaeus, Anth.

The chapters on Pythagoras' speeches, virtues, and deeds are made up of ‘history ’and‘doctrines ’. They point to the origin ofthe sciences and philosophy in Pythagoras' ‘discoveries ’.I n so doing they begin already the initiation ofthe reader to Pythagorean knowledge, just as Pythagoras had begun theeducation ofthe youths by showing them the achievements ofthe f ounders oftheir culture. 3.PythagoreanPhilosophy(BookII:TheProtreptic) InOn the Pythagorean Life Pythagoras appears as the mediator ofwhat seems to be the totality ofhuman science and philosophy (cf. 88, 24 –89, 7). Yet Iamblichus also claims a speci ﬁc character for Pythagorean knowledge.114This tension between the universality and the speci ﬁcity ofPythagoreanism is eased to some degree as the reader progresses through the successive books of On Pythagoreanism, following the pedagogical programme going from the general and common to the speci ﬁc and Pythagorean. Yet it is already resolved in principle in the Platonic evaluation ofthe various forms of knowledge which Iamblichus introduces in describing Pythagoras' scienti ﬁc achievements in the Life(18, 17–19, 10): thanks to Pythagoras, he says, the Greeks acquired a conception ofthe gods, heroes, and demons, ofthe world, ofastronomical phenomena, and ofall things in the physical universe; such a conception was correct andsuitable (likely, ἐοικυι ̑α) for these things, not in con ﬂict with appearances. But sciences also ( μαθήματα) and contemplation ( θɛωϱία) and all that which is scienti ﬁc(ἐπιστημονικ ά), which opens the mind's eye, purifying it ‘so as to be able to see the true principles and cause ofall things ’—all this too was mediated by Pythagoras. My paraphrase of this passage emphasizes the contrast Iamblichus is making between forms of knowledge which are ‘likely ’as to their truth (those having to do with material reality) and those that are scienti ﬁc and true (those having to40 IAMBLICHUS' ON PYTHAGOREANISM 11324, 16 –20.

This contrast, inspired by Plato's Timaeus (29 b –d), shows that not all that Pythagoras</p></div><p id="page">communicated is ofequal scienti ﬁc value. We can infer that what is speci ﬁcally Pythagorean is what is most important and truly scienti ﬁc, the study that leads the mind up to, and concerns unchanging immaterial reality. This is indeed how Iamblichus de ﬁnes the philosophy ofPythagoras, f ollowing here, appropriately enough, Nicomachus.115 The same position, presented in greater detail, can be found in the Protreptic. Having treated ofPythagoras in the preceding volume, Iamblichus here begins his account ofthe rest ofPythagoreanism, i.e. Pythagorean philosophy andscience. However, in order to introduce and ‘turn’the reader's soul to this subject, a progression from the general to the speci ﬁc must be observed. The progression is accomplished in the Protreptic in three stages: a protreptic to philosophy in general, not restricted to a speci ﬁc system (chapters 2 –3); 116an intermediate protreptic mixing in the general with the Pythagorean (chapters 4–20); a ﬁnal protreptic to the technical demonstrations ofthe Pythagoreans (chapter 21).117I shall discuss brie ﬂy the speci ﬁc Pythagoreanism introduced in the second and third stages ofthe progression.Ofchapters 4 –20, 5 and 13 are most clearly intended as speci ﬁcally‘Pythagorean ’. Chapter 5 begins as follows: We must also use as a protreptic the Pythagorean distinctions themselves. Succinctly, indeed perfectly and quitedifferently from other philosophies did the Pythagoreans divide the argument exhorting to philosophy, in thisfollowing his 〈Pythagoras' 〉teachings, skillfully strengthening and con ﬁrming〈it〉with highly scienti ﬁc and coherent demonstrations ( ἀποδ ɛίξɛσιν). (24, 14– 21) The distinctions that follow, 118and the ‘scienti ﬁc demonstrations ’that are based on them, are almost entirely derived from selected passages in Plato's dialogues: Iamblichus removes the dialogue form from the Platonic texts, isolatingthe premises and conclusions to be found in the texts, so as to produce a chain of arguments having the appearancePYTHAGOREAN PHILOSOPHY (BOOK II) 41 115Vit. Pyth. 89, 23 –90, 11 (cf. the references to Nicomachus in Deubner's app.); cf. 32, 17 –21; 40, 5 –14. 116This stage can include Pythagorean materials, used however as a protreptic to philosophy in general (cf. 16, 7 –10). 117Such at least is the programme announced in Pr.7, 12–8, 9. We shall ﬁnd that it changes somewhat when we reach ch. 21.

What is noteworthy, however, is not so much the conclusions ofthe arguments, which are not unexpected, as their f orm: they are a speci ﬁcally‘Pythagorean ’protreptic, because they are ‘scienti ﬁc demonstrations ’. The use ofPlatonic texts not only presupposes that Platonism is Pythagoreanism; it also makes the Platonic texts more truly ‘Pythagorean ’by giving to them a rigorous logical structure. In the ‘Pythagorean ’protreptic in chapter 13 120Iamblichus again resorts to paraphrasing Plato, especially the Phaedo whose emphasis on a duality between soul and body, on soul's need to escape the body through puri ﬁcation and to rise to the immaterial realm, makes explicit the otherworldly structure ofreality121presupposed by the ethical arguments ofchapter 5.When the reader reaches chapter 21 and awaits the third, most speci ﬁcally Pythagorean initiation, he ﬁnds an interpretation ofa variety ofPythagorean cryptic utterances ( σύμβολα), to which is applied, all over again, the triple protreptic mode: general, mixed, speci ﬁc (104, 26 –105, 18). And what is said to be ‘more Pythagorean ’ (Πυθαγο ϱικώτɛϱον) 122adds little to what has already been found in chapters 5 and 13.123There is, however, a passage that is worth noting. In explaining the utterance ‘Do not cut in two what is on the road’, Iamblichus says: Philosophy indeed, it seems, is a road.124〈The utterance 〉means then: choose that philosophy and that road to wisdom in which you will not ‘cut in two ’, in which you will propound, not contradictions, but ﬁrm and unchanging truths strengthened by scienti ﬁc demonstration through sciences ( μαθημ άτων) and contemplation ( θɛωϱίας), that is, philosophize in the Pythagorean manner ( Πυθαγο ϱικω ̑ς). . . .

(118, 7 –26). One will recognize in this passage the Numenian assimilation between different philosophies and their corresponding(i.e. immaterial and material) levels ofreality. 125The contrast, however, is not between Pythagorean Platonism and the Academy, but between Pythagorean Platonism and materialist, especially Stoic, philosophy.126The contrast serves to bring out, yet again, Iamblichus' (Nicomachean) identi ﬁcation ofthe scienti ﬁc character ofPythagoreanism as its speciﬁc characteristic, and his grounding ofthis scienti ﬁc character on the speci ﬁc (i.e. immaterial and unchanging) nature ofthe objects with which it is concerned.127 One more text must be quoted bef ore this review ofthe nature ofPythagorean philosophy, as it is presented in theProtreptic, can be concluded. The passage is found in an earlier part of the book (23, 21 –24, 3): 〈Archytas the Pythagorean says he is wise who 〉contemplates the one, the goal ofall contemplation.

For ifgod presides over all truth, happiness, all being, causes, principles, we must seek especially to acquire that science, through which we will see him clearly and through which we will ﬁnd a smooth road to him. The metaphor ofphilosophy as a road occurs here in an ontological landscape that is a good deal more complicatedthan that in chapter 21: there appears to be an ultimate cause of ‘being, causes,PYTHAGOREAN PHILOSOPHY (BOOK II) 43 125Cf. above, pp. 11 –12. 126For the Stoic identi ﬁcation ofsoul, quality, virtue as body, cf .

Pythagorean Mathematical Science (Book III: On GeneralMathematicalScience) IfPythagoras communicated all sorts ofknowledge to mankind, it is only those sciences leading up to, and concernedwith, unchanging immaterial reality which are speci ﬁcally Pythagorean. In this section I shall discuss the speci ﬁcally Pythagorean sciences, in particular the four mathematical sciences, their distinction from the (other) parts ofphilosophy, and their applicability outside the mathematical sphere, as these subjects are broached in Book III of On Pythagoreanism.The four mathematical sciences are distinguished from other sciences in good Platonic fashion, namely by means ofthe dif f erence between their objects ofstudy and the objects ofother sciences. Mathematics has to do with realitiesthat are intermediary between pure intelligibles (which are immaterial and indivisible) and sensibles (material anddivisible). 130Mathematical objects are thus immaterial and divisible, higher than sensibles and lower than intelligibles, a bridge joining causes to their effects (10, 8 –11, 7; 95, 5 –14). In fact the mathematical realm is a derivation from immaterial being (10, 24– 11, 3); it is parasitic on immaterial being as shadows depend on the objects casting them. Therefore it is to be conceived, not by abstraction from material reality, but by reference to immaterial being which itimages. The inferior image status it has in relation to true being is expressed in its properties of quantity and extension;its tendency to lack ofmass ( τὸἄογκον , a Plotinian neologism) and indivisibility indicates its orientation towards true being (34, 10 –18). IfIamblichus' identi ﬁcation ofthe realm ofmathematical objects as44 IAMBLICHUS' ON PYTHAGOREANISM 129Cf. 112, 9 –17; 108, 19 –20; 111, 1 –3. 130Or, more precisely, forms divided in bodies ( πɛϱὶτὰσώματαμ ɛϱιστά), i.e. enmattered forms; cf. Plotinus, IV 2, 1, 33 ff. On Iamblichus' ‘realism ’cf.

The general ontological differentiation between mathematical and other objects also helps to characterize the speci ﬁcity ofparticular mathematical principles and theorems. Limit and the unlimited, f or example, two principles ( ἀϱχαί)o f mathematical reality ( οὐσία), show the characteristic oftheir nature ( ἰδίωματη ̑ςοὐσίας53, 13), i.e. divisibility, which distinguishes them from the equivalent principles in the intelligible realm.133Such also is the case for quantity, which must be distinguished in its mathematical form from quantity in pure intelligibles or in sensibles (52, 5 –8). Mathematical principles are differentiated also from the principles of psychic reality ( οὐσία) by virtue oftheir unchanging character (13, 9 –15; 18, 16 –18). Thus to our list ofsciences should be added psychology, which treats ofa realm ofbeing parallel, it seems, to the mathematical realm, with important resemblances (as noted above) to themathematical realm, but not to be confused with it. 134Iamblichus also refers to sciences concerned with action (ethics, politics) and making.135The relation ofmathematics, not only to these latter practical and productive sciences, but also to the theoretical sciences already mentioned will be considered below. For the moment the system ofsciencesportrayed in the On General Mathematical Science andMATHEMATICAL SCIENCE (BOOK III) 45 131Cf. Plotinus, V 1, 3, 7 ff.; 7, 36 ff. Merlan (1960), 13, notes a similarity with the making of souls in Plato, Tim, 35 a.s 132Cf. 46, 7 –13; 39, 23 –6. It is not clear ifa distinction between a science ofintelligibles and a science ofthe divine is to be made; cf . Vit. Pyth. 88, 25 –6;Comm. 55, 8–19; 63, 24–64, 4; 91, 13 –18. 13312, 25 –13, 28; cf. 18, 13 –20; 50, 14 –26. 134Ch. 10; however the treatment of the relation between psychic and mathematical objects is far from clear in the work as a whole; cf. Merlan (1960), 15 –23, on the inconsistencies oftreatment. 135Cf. 56, 4 –8; 57, 22 –4; 74, 3 –4; 88, 29 –30; 91, 27 –92, 4. It is clear that Iamblichus is using an Aristotelian division ofthe sciences such as had been used to articulate</p><div id="pagenum"><p>Platonism by some Middle Platonists and by Porphyry; cf. O'Meara (1986), 5.</p></div><div id="pagenum"><p>the place ofmathematics in that system might be represented as f ollows, with the proviso that certain aspects willrequire re ﬁnement at a later stage:</p></div><p id="page">Structure ofreality System ofsciences the divine, pure intelligible being mathematicals, souls Theology, dialectic arithmetic geometry psychologymusicastronomy sensible objects physics ethics/politics sciences ofproduction In this diagram I have represented the four mathematical sciences in descending order. This is how Iamblichus tendsto treat them, namely as ifthey corresponded to f our sub-realms ofmathematical reality, each ofwhich is derived f romand inferior to the higher. 136Thus numbers would be higher than, and the sources of, geometrical ﬁgures, and so arithmetic will be correspondingly fundamental and prior to geometry. Must we then conclude that the objects ofastronomy derive from the objects of music? It must be admitted that Iamblichus offers, not one, but several principlesfor ordering the mathematical sciences, none of which are comprehensively applied and reconciled with otherprinciples oforder. For example, the subordinate status ofmusic and astronomy can be measured in terms oftheirlesser relation to immaterial being, an ontological order that need not entail a derivation ofthe objects ofmusic, f orinstance, from geometrical ﬁgures. 137Similarly, although it is implied that pure intelligible being is the source of numbers, it also looks as ifin one passage (15, 6 –23) numbers derive directly from the cause of being, ‘the One ’, and from a matter-like cause, and not indirectly through being. Iamblichus simply has not expressed himself clearly enoughfor a consistent picture to emerge on these matters. 13846 IAMBLICHUS' ON PYTHAGOREANISM 13614, 23 –15, 2 = Nicomachus, Intro. 9, 15–10, 22; 83, 7 –11; noteγɛωμɛτϱικὴοὐσίαin Iamblichus 18, 6 –7. 137Cf. 95, 14 –96, 3; Geminus in Proclus, In Eucl. 38, 1–12; Anatolius, Exc.277, 13 –278, 4.

Iamblichus characterizes mathematicalmethod as discursive, using λογισμ ός. It corresponds to the calculative thought proper to soul in Plotinus (e.g. V 3, 3,</p></div><p id="page">14–15) and to the discursive thinking, διάνοια, assigned to mathematics in Plato's Republic. In Plotinus and Iamblichus, discursive thought is considered inferior to a nondiscursive intellectual ‘intuition ’,νου ̑ς, of(and corresponding to) pure being. Thus for Iamblichus the study of intelligibles grasps its objects as if ‘by touch ’(κατ ′ἐπαϕήν), whereas mathematical science must operate by means ofa reasoning process ( διὰλόγου). 139 Iamblichus describes the discursive reasoning ofmathematical science as ‘syllogistic ’(35, 16 –17). Such recourse to a term oflogic raises the issue ofthe relation between mathematical method and logic, a question considered in chapter29. The idea that mathematics may derive its method from logic is rejected outright: the mathematical sciences have amethod or logic oftheir own. Elements ofthis logic are listed: division, de ﬁnition, various kinds ofsyllogisms, modes ofthe possible, impossible, and necessary. A distinction is also made between heuristic and critical method. 140 Iamblichus does not go any f urther than a bare enumeration ofsuch elements ofmathematical logic, but an applicationof this idea can be found at a later date in Proclus' use of logical analysis to set forth the structure of Euclideangeometrical demonstrations. 141The application oflogic to mathematics was not implausible: Aristotle himself frequently refers to mathematics in explaining his logic. It seems indeed that Iamblichus considers that logic can beilluminated by mathematical method. 142One might note ﬁnally that this chapter clari ﬁes considerably Iamblichus' earlier emphasis on the ‘demonstrative ’character ofPythagorean philosophy: he has in mind the syllogistic logic that heﬁnds in the mathematical sciences, which leads up to the nondiscursive intuition proper to the study ofintelligibles.

For the heuristic/critical distinction cf. Atticus, fr. 1, 18, and the heuristic/demonstrative distinction in Aristotle (cf. Iamblichus, In Nic. 4, 24). 141In Eucl. 69, 8 ff.; cf.

The relation between the study ofintelligibles, mathematics, and physics is particularly close: they are neighbours, sharing theoremsin common, a continuity corresponding to the continuity in the structure ofreality going f rom the realm oftheintelligibles, through mathematical, to sensible objects (88, 17– 26). At the same time the different sciences must not be confused with each other (88, 30 –89, 2). In order to show how mathematics can be applied outside its proper domain and in a way that does not involve confusion between it and other sciences, I shall review brie ﬂy Iamblichus' account ofthe use ofmathematics in each ofthe various non-mathematical branches ofphilosophy.(i) Mathematics and pure intelligibles. According to Iamblichus, who is using here without acknowledgement a texttaken from Plotinus, mathematics prepares the soul for the study of intelligibles by habituating it to the immaterial,purifying and strengthening it for the transition to pure being. 144It also anticipates the study ofintelligibles to some degree by dealing with pure beings according to various sorts ofcomparisons or assimilations ( ἀναϕοϱαί) listed as follows (61, 22– 8): (a) common rational principles ( κοινων ίατω ̑ναὐτω ̑νλόγων); (b) a dim imaging 〈ofpure beings in numbers 〉(ἔμϕασίςτις ἀμυδϱ ά); (c) similarity ( ὁμοιότης), near or distant; (d) resemblance ( ἀπɛικασία), between model (beings) and image (numbers);145 (e) causation (αἰτία), the relation between cause (beings) and effect (numbers). It will be necessary to consider other non-mathematical applications ofmathematics bef ore the meaning ofthisclassiﬁcation is considered.(ii) Mathematics and Soul. Iamblichus touches very little on this. An assimilation between mathematical theorems and soul's powers and conditions is mentioned (61, 15 –20), but not explained.(iii) Mathematics and sensible objects.

This might be compared to</p></div><p id="page">Nicomachus' proof(above, p. 18), as holding also f or the physical universe, ofthe mathematical derivation ofall f ormsofinequality f rom equality. In this connection Iamblichus gives again a classi ﬁcation ofthe bases according to which assimilations are made in mathematics to sensible objects (93, 19 –94, 10; I omit ( b), (d), (e) above, which occur also in this list): (f) abstraction ( ἀϕαίϱɛσις), enmattered form considered without matter; 146 (g)‘joining ’(ἐϕαϱμογή), where mathematical principles lead to, and touch, sensibles;147 (h) perfection ( τɛλɛίωσις), where mathematics perfects the imperfections of sensibles;148 (i) participation ( μɛτοχή), where sensibles participate in mathematical objects; (j) division (διαίϱɛσις), where a mathematical object is seen as divided and multiplied in sensibles; (k) comparison ( παϱαβολή), between mathematical and sensible forms. This classi ﬁcation embarrasses both by its richness, in the numb er ofmodes ofassimilation listed, and by its poverty, in the explanation of each mode. If the list is longer for physical than for intelligible assimilations, it might be notedalso that Iamblichus could well have included some ofthe modes ofphysical assimilations in the list of ‘intelligible ’ assimilations. 149This, together with the fact that both lists share modes ( b), (d), and ( e), encourages us to treat the lists together, at least as far as the interpretation of their general sense is concerned.One striking f eature ofthe lists ofmodes ofassimilation is the lack ofclear dif f erence between some ofthe modes,between ( c) and ( d) for example. It looks as if Iamblichus has collected the various terms, e.g. ὁμοίωσις,ἀπɛικασία, ἐϕαϱμογή, to be found in Pythagorean literature describing the pairing of numbers to various non-mathematical objects. 150His lists then are not true classi ﬁcations with clearly-de ﬁnedMATHEMATICAL SCIENCE (BOOK III) 49 146Also 64, 8 –17. 147Cf. 93, 7; 19, 1; 91, 13. 148Cf. 91, 25 –6. 149For example, mode ( i) is applied to theology at 91, 13 –14; the list ofmodes f or the intelligibles is in any case not presented as exhaustive (61, 28). 150Cf. above, pp. 20, 24, and Nicomachus, in anon.

Neither are they, however, mere inventories of terms: some of the modes seem tobe interpretations ofPythagorean pairings, e.g. modes ( e), (i), (j). I conclude then that Iamblichus is giving both a list of</p></div><p id="page">Pythagorean terms referring to assimilations between (primarily) numbers and other objects, and an interpretation ofthe basis ofsuch assimilations. This interpretation emerges most clearly f rom modes ( b), (d), (e), (i), and ( j): it is on the basis ofthe causal or participatory relation (which in Platonism is also a relation between model and image) betweenintelligibles and mathematicals and between mathematicals and sensibles, that mathematical theorems apply to theother two realms. Because mathematicals are ‘dim’images ofintelligibles, what is true in mathematics ‘shadows forth ’ what is true in the intelligible realm. And because sensibles are images ofmathematicals, what is true in mathematics isparadigmatically true ofthe physical universe. In the latter (but not in the f ormer) extrapolation ofmathematics,Iamblichus is re ﬁning Nicomachus' approach. 151Not surprisingly, given the unclear relation between the mathematical and psychic realms, the assimilations ofmathematicals to soul remain obscure in Iamblichus' account.Iamblichus also follows Nicomachus' lead when it comes to the relation between mathematics and the sciences ofaction, ethics and politics: mathematical principles have a paradigmatic function in ethics and politics (56, 4 –13; 91, 27 ff.). But this is not all. Presumably because the objects of mathematics are not, as in Nicomachus, the ultimate realities,they are not the ultimate standards ofaction. They lead rather to insight into such standards, which are above them.Thus they also have a protreptic function in ethics and politics (cf. 74, 3 –4), raising the mind to knowledge ofprinciples which should guide and be the goal ofaction.Politics, ethics, and physics do not, however, come within the ambit ofspeci ﬁcally ‘Pythagorean ’science and philosophy. The four mathematical sciences and the study of the intelligibles do. 152The mathematical sciences provide the scienti ﬁc demonstrative reasoning which foreshadows and prepares the soul for the non-discursive intuitive intellection ofpure immaterial being and especially ofthe highest divine principle, source, and goal ofeverything.Mathematics50IAMBLICHUS' ON PYTHAGOREANISM 151Cf. above, p. 18; in treating of mode ( i), identi ﬁed with mode ( d), in In Nic. 74, 12 –14 (κατὰ...μ ɛτουσίαɛκαὶἀϕομοίωσιν) Iamblichus is expanding on Nicomachus, Intro. 114, 17 –18 (κατ ′ɛἰκόνα).</p><div id="pagenum"><p>152Cf. the combination of Pythagorean μαθήματαandθɛωϱίαin the texts quoted above, pp. 40, 42.</p></div><div id="pagenum"><p>then is ancillary to, but an indispensible preparation for, higher science.

In line with the overall progression from the general to the speci ﬁc, it follows the preceding general introduction to mathematics in Book III as a speci ﬁc introduction (3, 5) to the ﬁrst and most fundamental of the mathematical sciences, arithmetic. Having treated of number considered in itself, it will be followed by Books V –VII dealing with number in relation to nature, ethics, and intelligible being (3, 13 –16), these to be followed in turn by introductions to the remaining three mathematical sciences.The importance ofNicomachus, as traced in the above study ofBooks I –III ofIamblichus' On Pythagoreanism, is made explicit in Book IV. For the purpose ofintroducing the reader to arithmetic Iamblichus does not f eel he can do betterthan reproduce Nicomachus' Introduction to Arithmetic. The reasons for his high esteem for Nicomachus are worth noting (4, 14 –5, 13). Iamblichus admires Nicomachus' style: precision, brevity, the most basic and general matters presented in orderly fashion. The purity of Nicomachus' Pythagorean mathematics is also stressed. The scienti ﬁc, demonstrative command ofarithmetic in Nicomachus is praised. In short, Nicomachus embodies the highest literaryand Pythagorean virtues in Iamblichus' eyes. For these reasons Iamblichus announces his intention simply toreproduce Nicomachus' Introduction, adding, subtracting, changing nothing. 154 As a matter off act this claim is not veri ﬁed by what follows.MATHEMATICAL SCIENCE (BOOK III) 51 153Cf. above, n. 46. 1545, 15–25, where Iamblichus also denies any intention to introduce foreign matters ( καινά); he will reproduce only the opinions ofthe ‘ancients’ .

Numenius may also be the inspiration ofIamblichus' stress on the purity ofNicomachus' Pythagoreanism.</p></div><div id="pagenum"><p>Iamblichus does add to, and subtract from, Nicomachus' Introduction. One wonders consequently what to make ofhis</p></div><p id="page">protestations of ﬁdelity. I think these might be understood in relation to the Pythagorean charges, reported in Porphyry's Life of Pythagoras (cf. above, p. 11), of fraud, false interpretation, plagiary, and malevolent quotation perpetrated against Pythagorean writings. Porphyry himself, perhaps mindful of such abuses, makes claims of addingand subtracting nothing ( Philosophy from Oracles 109, 4). It is in relation to such charges that Iamblichus' profession of ﬁdelity to Nicomachus should be judged in comparison with his actual practice, which is indeed faithful in this sense, if not in a modern literal sense requiring exact duplication.The differences between Nicomachus' Introduction and Iamblichus' ‘new edition ’ofNicomachus in Book IV ofOn Pythagoreanism have already been carefully determined. 155A few of these may be brie ﬂy noted here. Iamblichus ﬂeshes out some ofNicomachus' statements, e.g. his de ﬁnitions of number, with information drawn from Pythagorean literature.156He includes at several points criticisms of Euclid which help to bring out the difference between Nicomachus' numerical treatment ofarithmetic and Euclid's geometrical approach to numbers.157Finally, Iamblichus gives more emphasis to the ethical and physical implications ofnumber than that already given in Nicomachus'Introduction. 158This last aspect ofIamblichus' additions to Nicomachus will be discussed f urther in the next chapter, in the context ofa reconstruction ofBooks V –VII of On Pythagoreanism.52 IAMBLICHUS' ON PYTHAGOREANISM 155By D'Ooge et al.

In this chapter I shall present brie ﬂy the argument showing that certain ofPsellus' writings are indeed excerpts taken f rom On Pythagoreanism V–VII, and shall attempt a reconstruction ofthese lost books in so f ar as this can be done on the basis ofPsellus' excerpts. For these purposes it will be usef ul to consider ﬁrst some aspects ofPsellus' philosophical interests and writings. 1.MichaelPsellus,PhilosophicalExcerptor Michael Psellus had a long and, on the whole, brilliant career as a most in ﬂuential member ofthe Byzantine court. He himself ﬁnds the origins ofthis success in his literary or rhetorical abilities and these, together with his philosophical ambitions, provide the occasion for unrestrained displays of vanity.159Ifscarcely appealing to us, such pretensions were no doubt well calculated to project the ‘image ’that Psellus wished and made for himself at the Byzantine court. In support ofhis claims he could point to an enormous body ofliterature that he somehow managed to produce underhis own name and which, even today, has not yet been fully sorted out, printed, and examined. In this vast collection ofwritings 160one can ﬁnd many philosophical, theological, legal, medical, rhetorical, poetical treatises; a large 159Cf.Chron.

In what f ollows I shall be concerned only with those parts ofPsellus' enormous literaryactivity that have to do with philosophy.The Chronographia informs us about Psellus' philosophical studies and goals. Having mastered rhetoric he turned, so he tells us, to philosophy and learnt logic, physics, mathematics, and metaphysics. In philosophy he had to teach himself:he claims that he found ‘wisdom expiring in those who partook ofit ’and that he ‘could not ﬁnd worthy teachers or a seed ofwisdom in Greece or among the barbarians ’. 161Psellus would have us believe that he acquired his knowledge of philosophy through his own unsupervised reading ofbooks, or rather that these books themselves guided him: thelater Greek philosophers referred him back to Plato and Aristotle, after which he returned in his reading to laterphilosophers, Plotinus, Porphyry, Iamblichus, ending with Proclus, a ‘great haven ’in which he could ﬁnd all knowledge (I 136). If Psellus attempts in this account to make his education in philosophy follow the progress of the soul fromlogic and physics towards ‘higher mysteries ’(metaphysics) as prescribed by later Neoplatonists such as Iamblichus and Proclus, it is not so much for the attainment of such mysteries that he wishes to be admired, as for his labour indrawing philosophy forth from wells long neglected and blocked up, and in distributing it freely to all (I 138).Anticipating Marsilio Ficino's undertaking, four centuries later in Italy, Psellus is claiming in fact to bring back to lifeand foster Greek philosophy which had long remained hidden and inaccessible. 162 To judge by the number ofphilosophical works Psellus produced, his contemporaries must have been f airly ﬂooded by the newly-opened fountains of philosophy. These works show that Psellus read not only Plato, Aristotle, Plotinus,Porphyry, Iamblichus, and Proclus, but also almost every other Greek philosophical author to be found in the librariesofhis time: Alexander ofAphrodisias, Ammonius, Aspasius, David, Elias, Hermias, Nemesius, Philoponus, Plutarch,54ON PYTHAGOREANISM VlVII IN PSELLUS 161I 135; for a sceptical view of these claims, cf.

Psellus</p><div id="pagenum"><p>was also more circumspect about the compatibility ofGreek philosophy with Christian doctrine than was Ficino; cf . Hunger (1978), 50 –1; below, n. 12.</p></div><div id="pagenum"><p>Simplicius, Synesius, Syrianus, and no doubt others.163His labours thus ranged over almost the whole corpus ofGreek</p></div><p id="page">philosophy as it survived in his day. This corpus was somewhat larger than it is now, since he read and used someworks which have since disappeared: Proclus' Commentary on Plotinus, hisCommentary on the ‘Chaldaean Oracles ’, 164 Iamblichus' On Pythagoreanism V–VII, and in all likelihood other works which have not yet been identi ﬁed.165 Not only do Psellus' philosophical works show very wide reading ofthe Greek philosophical manuscripts available tohim. They are also largely excerpted from these manuscripts. The ways in which Psellus incorporated excerpts in hisphilosophical works might be described roughly as follows.Some ofhis writings are little more than centos made up, no doubt, f or use by himselfand his pupils. An example ofthis is an eight-page series ofpassages, sometimes slightly rephrased, selected f rom over three hundred pages ofNemesius' On the Nature ofMan. 166A somewhat more elaborate case is the short work on the six de ﬁnitions of philosophy, in which Psellus selects and combines passages taken (without acknowledgement) from the Prolegomena to Philosophy ofDavid and ofElias. At the end Psellus indicates that the work is a synopsis designed f or his pupils' use, taking account oftheir limitations by omitting more complicated and prof ound matters.167 With this work might be compared various other pieces in which excerpts are presented as explanations ofcertainquestions, subjects or texts. Philos. min. no. 7, for example, explaining some phrases in Plato's Phaedrus, is compiled from Hermias' Commentary on the Phaedrus, to which Psellus adds introductory words. Philos. min. no. 11 nominally discusses Greek doctrines about soul, but consists in fact of selections from Proclus' Elements ofTheology —Psellus again merelyPSELLUS, PHILOSOPHICAL EXCERPTOR 55 163Cf.

We owe to Psellus information con ﬁrming the authorship ofIamblichus' On Mysteries : Sicherl (1960). In other ﬁelds too Psellus used works no longer extant: cf.

The short work On the Forms is an interesting case: the work survives both in the</p></div><p id="page">f orm ofa bare cento ofexcerpts taken f rom Plotinus, Ennead V 9, and in a more elaborate form, addressed to a high- ranking friend, in which Psellus has added a short introductory paragraph to the Plotinian excerpts (againunacknowledged). 168 Very much like this last case is a large number ofpieces, usually quite short, in which the selection ofexcerpts (almostnever declared as such) is preceded by a few introductory lines in which Psellus claims to be replying to a question putto him. Psellus also sometimes adds some concluding phrases. Not infrequently does the alleged occasion of the work,the question put to Psellus, appear in the Greek source from which Psellus is excerpting. We must supposeconsequently that the alleged occasion ofthe work is ﬁctitious, which is not to deny that in somecases Psellus is responding to a real inquiry or that Psellus has didactic purposes in mind when collecting questions to put to himselfand to his pupils. Some pieces are presented as ifthey were letters. Let one example ofthis type suf ﬁce. In Philos. min. no. 8 Psellus reports that his questioner (or correspondent) is puzzled by the following ‘wondrous ’problem (θαυμάσιόνθιἠποϱήσας): why, ifeach ofour senses is composed f rom each ofthe physical elements, are there ﬁve senses, but only four elements? One might admire the erudition and acuity both of Psellus' pupil or friend and ofPsellus' answer ifone did not ﬁnd both the puzzle and the answer in some pages ofAlexander ofAphrodisias. 169 Not all ofPsellus' philosophical works are simple centos ofborrowed passages presented as synopses, explanations, oranswers to questions. In some pieces his contribution goes beyond that merely ofexcerpting and appending pref atoryand/or concluding phrases. He can, in some cases, compare the pagan Greek material he is excerpting with Christiandoctrine. 170In other cases he incorporates echoes, rather than passages, from various Greek sources in prose characterized by considerable philosophical imprecision and by greater recourse to rhetorical device. Such is theprimarily ornamental use made ofphilosophical learning in Psellus' literary show-pieces: his f ormal letters and hispanegyrical speeches. 17156 ON PYTHAGOREANISM VlVII IN PSELLUS 168Philos. min. no. 33. 169Other examples ofthis sort ofwork: Philos. min. nos. 4, 5, 6, 10, 14, 44.

I may be permitted here to summarize and expand at some points my argument published elsewhere (1981) in support ofthis identi ﬁcation ofthe source ofthe two works in question. In 1892 Paul Tannery edited a small piece by Psellus entitled On Numbers. He also suggested that On Numbers made use ofIamblichus' On Pythagoreanism V–VII. Indeed On Numbers quotes a work ofIamblichus, an ‘arithmetic ofhigher 〈i. e. divine〉natures ’which can be identi ﬁed plausibly with On Pythagoreanism VII. 172Tannery's suggestion was, however, largely ignored. In 1981 I showed that On Numbers is in fact a shortened version of twoother works by Psellus entitled On Physical Number and On Ethical and Theological Arithmetic. I also published these two works173and pointed to new evidence in them con ﬁrming Tannery's suggestion about Psellus' source. First, the very titles ofPsellus' two works match, and in the right order, the titles ofBooks V, VI, and VII of On Pythagoreanism as they are reported in the pinaxin manuscript F: On Arithmetic in Physical Matters, On Arithmetic in Ethical Matters, On Arithmetic in Theological Matters. Furthermore, Psellus' On Physical Number, which does not name Iamblichus, contains a passage (lines 90 –2)—not found in the short version, On Numbers —that corresponds closely in language and content to a report on Iamblichus' On Pythagoreanism V to be found in the fourth/ ﬁfth century Neoplatonist Syrianus: The more accurate accounts do not admit ofaparadigm ofthe void ( ) in numbers since there is no void either in beings, as Iamblichusshows in Book V ofhis work on Pythagoreanism.(Syrianus, In met. 149, 28 –31)Neither in nature nor in physical number is there void.Its paradigm would be nothing other than lack ofharmony and lack ofsymmetry ( ἀσυμμ ɛτϱιία). But lack ofsymmetry is banished f rom numbers. (Psellus, On Phys. Numb. 90–2)PSELLUS' EXCERPTS 57 172Cf. the pinax cited above, p. 33.</p><div id="pagenum"><p>173Reprinted below (Appendix I).

We are told what the paradigm ofthe voidmight be (ifthere were such) in numbers —ἀσνμμ ɛτϱία—and why there could be no such paradigm in numbers:</p></div><p id="page">numbers do not admit of ἀσυμμ ɛτϱία. Psellus also speaks of ‘nature ’rather than of ‘beings ’as does Syrianus. But by ‘beings ’Syrianus means ‘natural beings ’and this imprecision, together with the lack ofdetail as compared to Psellus' passage, is just what one would expect ofa report on Iamblichus' text, just as the accuracy and greater inf ormation inPsellus show him to be following more closely the Iamblichean original. The notion that there are in numbersparadigms or models off eatures ofthe natural world is ofcourse to be f ound in Nicomachus ofGerasa and has beenseen above (pp. 49 –50) to be applied by Iamblichus already in On Pythagoreanism III. It is an idea that can be expected to have been ofconsiderable importance in Book V.Although Iamblichus is not named in Psellus' On Physical Number, it is clear from Syrianus' report that Psellus is using to some extent On Pythagoreanism V. However, in On Ethical and Theological Arithmetic, roughly at midpoint (line 53) when moving from ‘ethical ’to‘theological ’arithmetic, Psellus does name Iamblichus, referring to a speci ﬁc work (an ‘arithmetic ofhigher 〈divine〉natures ’) from which he quotes. In view of the evidence presented so far, we are justiﬁed in concluding that Psellus is here using On Pythagoreanism VII and, in the ﬁrst halfofthe piece, VI. But to what extent do Psellus' two works re ﬂect the contents of On Pythagoreanism V–VII? Are they excerpts from Iamblichus? Or do they contain no more than occasional echoes ofIamblichean themes, perhaps combined with a f ewquotations? The resolution ofthis problem can be f ound in a comparison between the compositional structure ofPsellus' two works and the various sorts ofphilosophical compositions described in the preceding section (above): thetwo works in question resemble most, in approximate length and structure, those other works ofPsellus which arecompilations ofexcerpts presented as replies to questions or puzzles, as the f ollowing briefreview oftheir structurewill show.On Physical Number begins as ifit were written in answer to a question which looks ﬁctitious. Psellus' questioner is said to have wondered much ( ἐθαύμασας), on the occasion ofa discussion the day bef ore ( τὴνχθὲςσυνουσ ίαν),on hearing from</p><div id="pagenum"><p>Psellus that there is ‘physical number ’as well as mathematical number, and hence asks to58 ON PYTHAGOREANISM VlVII IN PSELLUS</p></div><div id="pagenum"><p>know more about it.174So also did Critias behave —ifnot à propos the same subject —in Plato's Timaeus (25 e): he also</p></div><p id="page">wondered much ( ἐθαύμαζον) on hearing Socrates' discourse the day before ( λέγοντος ...χθὲςσου ̑) about the ideal republic. One may be permitted to doubt that Psellus and his friends adopted the practices of Plato's characters in anyother area than that ofliterary conceit, and to suppose that Psellus must have f ound, towards the beginning of On Pythagoreanism V, a question raised about the various sorts of number, physical, mathematical, and intelligible. 175The opening lines of On Physical Number are then followed by a series of paragraphs which read like a discontinuous series ofbits ofmaterial relating number to a variety ofthemes. In a concluding paragraph Psellus, as is sometimes hispractice, 176subscribes, but with quali ﬁcations, to these doctrines of ‘the ancients ’(95–9). The series ofbits ofmaterial continues in On Ethical and Theological Arithmetic, ﬁrst relating numbers to ethical themes, and in the second half, marked by the reference to Iamblichus, dealing with numbers and theology. In two ﬁnal sentences (87 –90) Psellus concludes by recognizing that these matters will probably be unpalatable for his reader.This compositional structure matches exactly that ofthose pieces described above in which Psellus can be observed tobe assembling strings ofexcerpts in the guise ofan answer to an of ten ﬁctitious question. This allows us to conclude that, with the exception ofsome introductory and concluding words (roughly lines 1, 94 –8o f On Physical Number ; 53, 81, 87– 90, in part, of On Ethical and Theological Arithmetic ), all ofPsellus' two works derives, in the f orm ofbrief excerpts, from Iamblichus' On Pythagoreanism V–VII. Ifit is assumed, by analogy with Books I –IV, that Books V– VII were each the equivalent ofabout one hundred printed pages in length, then the excerpts f rom Book V in Psellus' On Physical Number amount to about 1/25 ofthe book, and the excerpts in On Ethical and Theological Arithmetic amount to about 1/50 ofBooks VI and VII each.With such meagre remains must the attempt to reconstruct Iamblichus' On Pythagoreanism V–VII begin. The situation is not unlike that in which ancient pots are reconstructed from some scattered sherds. We must try to recoverIamblichus' lost books from small signs, fragmentary indications of broader patterns. As withPSELLUS' EXCERPTS 59 174Lines 1 –4 (the question is implied in line 4, ἀπῄτησας). 175Cf. the parallel texts cited in the notes to lines 3 –8 (below, Appendix I).</p><div id="pagenum"><p>176Cf.Philos. min. nos. 29, 35.</p></div><div id="pagenum"><p>sherds, Psellus' excerpts may be broken off and damaged in different ways: when excerpting, Psellus may copy apassage word-for-word and in extenso ; he may omit words, phrases, even lines here and there in the passage; he can</p></div><p id="page">transpose words and whole sentences, alter the grammar, or pick out key words and phrases in such a way that thesource text is summarized in its own words rather than quoted. 177Each piece ofevidence must be considered and a general pattern built up gradually. It is clear that all that can be hoped for is results that are far from complete and thatmust be largely tentative in nature. The task ofreconstruction is made somewhat easier however by the f act thatIamblichus tells us a certain amount already in On Pythagoreanism I–IV about his intentions in Books V –VII. Psellus' excerpts will also point to various other methods facilitating reconstruction. 3.OnPythagoreanismV (I)GeneralPlan Iamblichus indicates at various points in Book IV what he intends to do in the following three books. Book IVdiscusses number in itselfand is to be f ollowed by a treatment ofnumber in nature, in ethical behaviour, and in theForms or beings ( In Nic. 3, 13– 16). Book V in particular is referred to at In Nic. 118, 12 –18, where Iamblichus announces his purpose to deal next with the decad and with the ‘implications ’ 178ofthe other numbers f rom the monad to the decad. This is then connected up with the ﬁrst passage (3, 13 –16) later, at the end ofBook IV ( In Nic. 125, 19–22), when Iamblichus tells us he will show the implications ofnumber, f rom the monad to the decad, ‘ordering matters according to the physical, the ethical, and furthermore (and prior to 〈i.e. above 〉these) the theological account (λόγος)’. Physical, ethical, and theological ‘accounts ’will thus provide the framework in which the ‘implications ’ofnumbers, f rom the monad to the decad, will be treated. This programme, arranged according to three different sciences, is re ﬂected in the titles ofBooks V –VII. How it is carried out can be determined to some degree thanks to Psellus'60ON PYTHAGOREANISM VlVII IN PSELLUS 177Cf. the analysis of Psellus' excerpting practices in Aujac (1975 b), Gautier (1977), 196. 178ἐπανθήματα. Cf. LSJ s.v.: ‘special properties ’; what is involved is not so much the special properties ofnumbers in themselves ( ἰδιώματα), as what arises from these</p><div id="pagenum"><p>properties for non-mathematical objects.</p></div><div id="pagenum"><p>excerpts. I shall examine ﬁrst what these excerpts indicate about the ‘implications ’ofnumber f or nature, according to</p></div><p id="page">the‘physical account ’, as these were set forth in On Pythagoreanism V.179 Psellus ﬁrst distinguishes in On Physical Number (3–8) between different sorts of number, ideal or intelligible, mathematical and physical. He then relates numbers to formal (13 –26), material (27 –32), and ef ﬁcient causation (33–6), to change (67 –74), to the ﬁnite and in ﬁnite (75 –80), to place (81 –9), and to the void (90 –3). One will recognize here roughly the agenda oftopics ofAristotle's Physics I–IV, as listed for example by the later Greek Neoplatonists Proclus ( In Tim. I6 ,2 4 –6) and John Philoponus ( In Phys. 2, 13–16). One major topic is missing in Psellus, time; no doubt it could be found in the Iamblichean original. That the topics of Physics I–IV only are represented can hardly be accidental. For Porphyry had argued for, and imposed on Aristotle's treatise, a division into two parts, I –IV concerning physics, V –VIII concerning change.180It seems then that in On Pythagoreanism V Iamblichus followed in general the agenda ofAristotle's Physics (I–IV) in dealing with the implications ofnumber in physics. One might wonder, however, ifPsellus' excerpts in On Physical Number might have been taken from some introductory pages of On Pythagoreanism V, and thus that the sequence ofsubjects discussed might not af ter all re ﬂect the overall plan ofthe work, which may, f or example, have adopted the traditional plan ofPythagorean decadic literature —that also of Nicomachus' Theologoumena —dealing in succession with each number ofthe decad and with its various associations. The evidence, however, such as it is, does not support this supposition. Iamblichus' reference in On Pythagoreanism IV to an ordering ofthe implications ofnumber ‘according to the physical ...a ccount ’(In Nic. 125, 19 –22) supports, and is clari ﬁed by, a plan for On Pythagoreanism V in which number would have been discussed according to an order inspired by Aristotle's Physics. The manner ofPsellus' excerpting points in the same direction: some excerpts consist merely oflines cited out ofcontext, others are f uller and more intelligible.181This suggests uneven dipping in a wide span oftext rather than excerpting f rom a small number ofpages. This impression will beBOOK V 61 179Ofthe issues raised by Psellus' excerpts I shall discuss only those relating to the reconstruction ofIamblichus' books in what f ollows. 180Simplicius, In phys. 802, 7 –13; cf.

(II)PhysicalNumber The sorts ofnumber which Psellus presents at ﬁrst to his puzzled companion —intelligible or ideal ( ɛἰδητικ ός) number, mathematical, and physical number ( On Phys. Numb. 4–8)—recall distinctions between different sorts of number appearing already in On Pythagoreanism III: ideal number, self-moved number,182and the principles and forms in bodies (Comm. 64, 2–19). These last are described in Psellus' excerpts as ‘physical number ’. They correspond to (Aristotelian) immanent forms and (Stoic) ‘seeds ’which organize matter and which had been introduced into the Platonic universe by Plotinus and by Platonists before him.183To call them ‘physical numbers ’, however, is unusual.184On Pythagoreanism IV points to the reasoning behind this: the demiurgic god organized the world by means ofnumerical f orms andprinciples,εἴδεσικα ὶλόγοιςτοι ̑ςκατ ʼἀϱιθμόν(In Nic. 79, 5–8). The numerical organization ofthe world allows one to describe the immanent, organizing principles ofphysical bodies as numbers, physical numbers to distinguish them from mathematical numbers, which are the paradigms ofsuch numbers. According to Psellus' excerpts the philosophershould ‘ﬁt’these ‘physical numbers ’to the causes in nature ( On Phys. Numb. 11–12), which is indeed what is done in the following excerpts. (III)FormalandMaterialCausation Psellus' excerpts next speak oftwo sorts ofcause an d assign various numbers and groups ofnumbers to each ( On Phys. Numb. 13–32). In particular, numbers related to the monad (odd numbers) are said to be62 ON PYTHAGOREANISM VlVII IN PSELLUS 182Apparently relating to soul, which has some close but obscure relationship with mathematicals. 183For these in Iamblichus, cf. Comm. 55, 26 –56, 2 ( ɛἴδηϕυσικά);De myst. 169, 7 ff.; In Tim. frs. 47 –8;In Parm. fr. 2, 13 –14. Cf. Proclus, In Tim.

This rapprochement</p></div><p id="page">between monad and form, dyad and matter, had already been made in On Pythagoreanism IV: the properties ofnumber are said there to derive from monad and dyad, just as all in the physical universe is based on form and matter; matterhas the inde ﬁniteness and inequality of the dyad, just as the monad has a formal function in constituting numbers ( In Nic.77, 22 –79, 8). Indeed Aristotle himselfhad suggested in Physics I( 1 8 9b8 –16, 191 b 35 –6) that the Platonic theory of‘the one ’and the dyad (the ‘great and small ’) anticipated his distinction between formal and material causes. Yet Aristotle also felt that he had superseded the Platonic theory, the inadequacy of which he seeks to show in Physics I9 . There is no trace in Psellus' excerpts ofa response to Aristotle's critique ofthe Platonic theory ofcauses (presumablyassumed by Iamblichus to be Pythagorean). One wonders consequently, on the supposition that Iamblichus usedAristotle's Physics inOn Pythagoreanism V, ifthat use might have been very super ﬁcial, perhaps merely a naïve adaptation ofthe Aristotelian theory ofcauses to Pythagorean numerical lore, involving little ef f ort to meet Aristotle's criticism ofPlatonic-Pythagorean speculations. Yet the later Neoplatonic commentators on the Physics Simplicius and Philoponus (both end ofthe ﬁfth/early sixth century) show that Aristotle's critique in Physics I 9 was not thought by Neoplatonists to be justi ﬁed. Aristotle's main point was that the Platonists failed to distinguish between matter and privation; their theory postulated only two ofthe threecauses (form, matter, privation) required if dif ﬁculties in accounting for physical changes were to be avoided (cf. 192 a 3–12). Simplicius argues, however, that Plato did know of ‘privation ’,d eﬁned as ‘absence ( ἀπονσία) ofthe f orms to be produced in matter’; it is found namely in his concept of an all-receptive matrix. Such a cause, however, is only logically distinguishable from matter. Being a cause only as absence, it is not an elementconstitutive per seofphysical bodies and thus is not included in the list ofsuch elements. 185This need not have been Iamblichus' assessment ofAristotle's critique in Physics I 9, but it shows at least that the critique need not have been felt to support Aristotle's claim to have gone beyond the Platonic-Pythagorean account ofcausation in the physical world.BOOK V 63</p><div id="pagenum"><p>185In phys. 245, 19 –29; 246, 2 –16 ( ἀπουσία> is Aristotle's own term, 191 a 6 –7).

Numb. 33–64). It is argued, for example, that the numerically de ﬁned rhythms ofthe heavens, ofhealth, disease, birth, and death, show numbers to act as ef ﬁcient causes. The instances ofnumbered rhythms given are banal enough in the Pythagorean tradition;186not so is the identi ﬁcation ofnumbers as ef ﬁcient causes. Certain numbers, the ‘generative numbers ’(34) seem to do double-duty, since they have already been put in the class off ormal causes (21 –2). Psellus' excerpts suggest here too at most a superﬁ cial match between Pythagorean arithmetic and Aristotle's Physics. Again, however, the later Neoplatonic commentators on the Physics show that this need not be the case. Having dealt with formal and material causation in Physics I, Aristotle adds in Physics II two further causes: ef ﬁcient and ﬁnal causes. Already in I 6 he had intimated that the Platonists identi ﬁed formal with ef ﬁcient causation (189 b 14– 16), as we have seen above in the case of ‘generative numbers ’. Indeed in Physics II 7 Aristotle himself ﬁnds that formal, ef ﬁcient, and ﬁnal causes in nature are often identical, in form at least, if not in number. The later Neoplatonic commentators went even further in identifyingformal with ef ﬁcient causes in nature. For them Aristotle's description ofthe ef ﬁcient cause as ‘theﬁrst cause of change ’(Phys.194 b 29 –30) implied that only the ﬁrstsource ofall change in the universe is properly speaking an efﬁcient cause; all other immanent causes, or ‘natures ’, are formal causes. 187Thus Iamblichus' use ofthe same numbers for different causal functions need not imply a super ﬁcial treatment ofAristotle's Physics, ifindeed he is using the Physics inOn Pythagoreanism V. (V)Change Theﬁrstclearevidence that Iamblichus attempted in On Pythagoreanism V a critical, ‘Pythagorean ’, reading ofAristotle's Physics is found in Psellus' excerpts on the subject of change (67 –74). In the corresponding section ofthe Physics (III 1–2) Aristotle formulates a de ﬁnition ofchange presented as superior to those ofhis predecessors, in particular the Platonic-Pythagorean identi ﬁcation ofchange with64 ON PYTHAGOREANISM VlVII IN PSELLUS 186Cf. the references given in Appendix I, ad loc.</p><div id="pagenum"><p>187Simplicius, In phys. 315, 10 –15 (quoting Alexander ofAphrodisias). Cf . Syrianus, In met. 82, 4–5.</p></div><div id="pagenum"><p>difference, inequality, non-being, i.e. the dyad. Such an identi ﬁcation, he allows, is plausible in view ofthe relation</p></div><p id="page">change seems to have with the inde ﬁnite. Yet he rejects it: Difference, inequality, non-being are not necessarily changed, whether they are different, unequal, or non-existent.188 Not only do Psellus' extracts retain, however, the association ofchange with the dyad— referring indeed to the relation noted by Aristotle between change and the inde ﬁnite (70 –1)—but they add a quali ﬁcation: The causes ofchange 〈are〉. . . difference and inequality (one 〈sort ofthese 〉is like a relation and property, which is rest ( ἠϱɛμία), the other 〈sort〉a‘differentiating ’(ἑτɛϱοίωσις) and ‘unequalizing ’(ἀνίσωσις), such that it is not the different and unequal that are in change, but those made different and unequal). (69 –74) The relevance ofthis quali ﬁcation would not be clear ifone did not have in mind the Aristotelian passage quoted just before. By comparing the two texts we can see that Iamblichus is defending the Pythagorean association of changewith the dyad by making a distinction between difference as a relation and as a ‘differentiating ’intended to respond to Aristotle's criticism. We have thus discovered evidence in Psellus' excerpts showing that Iamblichus, in On Pythagoreanism V, attempted to come to terms with Aristotle's criticisms ofPlatonism-Pythagoreanism in the Physics. But what exactly was Iamblichus' response to Aristotle? It is hard to reconstruct a complete answer from the meagrefragments in Psellus. The distinctions made and the language used are found again, however, in Simplicius'commentary on the passage ofthe Physics, and this suggests that Simplicius might give some idea ofwhat might have been Iamblichus' position. Simplicius distinguishes between ( a) difference as a Form; ( b) what is different by sharing in the Form; and ( c)‘differentiating ’(ἑτɛϱοίωσις). Plato and the Pythagoreans identi ﬁed change with ( c), whereas Aristotle took them, so Simplicius claims, to be referring to ( a).Aristotle's criticism is misdirected ( In  Phys.432, 35 ff.). ‘Differentiating ’expresses the fact that when something changes it becomes different from what it was before.189ThusBOOK V 65 188Phys. 201 b 16 –27: . . . ἑτɛϱότητακα ὶἀνισότητακα ὶτὸμὴὂνϕάσκοντ ɛςεἰ̑ναιτὴνκίνησιν ὡ̑νοὐδὲνἀναγκαι ̑ονκινει ̑σθαι,οὔτἂνἕτɛϱαᾐ̑οὔτ′ἂνἄνισαοὔτ′ἂνοὐκὄντα.</p><div id="pagenum"><p>189Simplicius, In phys. 433, 35 –434, 1 (almost identical to On Phys.

(VI)Place Another, fainter trace of Iamblichus' attitude to Aristotle's Physics can be detected in the excerpts ofPsellus concerning number and place ( On Phys. Numb. 81–9). These excerpts follow some sentences on the ﬁnite and in ﬁnite (75 –80). In hisPhysics Aristotle had listed form, matter, extension, and the boundary of the containing body as possible de ﬁnitions ofplace (IV 4, 211 b 7 –9). He prefers the last of these (212 a 2 –6). In Psellus' excerpts, however, place is described as ‘accompanying bodies ’,συνακολουθου ̑ντατοι ̑ςσώμασι(83). Ifthis matches neither Aristotle's position nor the other possibilities he mentions, it is, we can now assume, for a good reason. Fortunately this is con ﬁrmed and the few words in Psellus clari ﬁed by Simplicius who quotes extensively from Iamblichus' Commentary on the Timaeus à propos the same subject: Iamblichus writes: Every body inasmuch as it is body subsists in place. Place therefore comes into beingconnaturally with bodies ( συμϕυὴςἄϱατοι ̑ςσώμασιν ὁτόποςσυνυ ϕέστηκɛ). 191 In what follows in Simplicius, Iamblichus contrasts this view of place with other views, including that of Aristotle andanother mentioned by Aristotle (place as extension). 192Iamblichus is concerned here with the interpretation ofPlato's Timaeus, not with Aristotle's Physics. Yet what he says implies criticism ofAristotle. He distinguishes a central f rom a purely extraneous role given to place. Aristotle's view ofplace assumes it is something peripheral to bodies. But ifplaceis an essential part of66ON PYTHAGOREANISM VlVII IN PSELLUS 190The term ἑτɛϱοίωσιςrecalls Aristotle's term ἀλλοίωσιςreferred to by Simplicius ( In phys. 432, 35 –433, 1), and is found in Aristotle, Phys. 217 b 26. 191Iamblichus, In Tim. fr. 90, 8 –10 (Dillon's transl., modi ﬁed).</p><div id="pagenum"><p>192The third view mentioned by Iamblichus ( In Tim. fr. 90, 13 –15), place asχωϱήματαδι άκɛνα, recalls the Pythagorean concept ofvoid discussed below.</p></div><div id="pagenum"><p>what it is to be a body,193then it must be intimately involved in the existence ofbodies. It is not a mere boundary, but</p></div><p id="page">rather a bond ofbodies. Ifit encloses them, it does so, not as a circumambient limit, but as a power supporting,gathering, delimiting bodies. 194 Simplicius does not inform us much more about Iamblichus' views on place. He does, however, consider them to berelated to those ofAristotle's pupil Theophrastus and ofSimplicius' own master Damascius. Theophrastus, as quotedby Simplicius ( In Phys. 639, 15 –22), saw place as the relative position ofparts in a whole, position being closely tied to the nature ofthe whole. Damascius' theory ofplace is extremely complicated, 195and I can only note some aspects ofit here. He distinguished between a ‘proper ordering ’(ɛὐθɛτισμός) ofparts, which is connatural ( σύμϕυτος), and an extraneous ( ἐπɛίσακτος ) local situation.196The connatural ‘proper ordering ’has an organizing, preserving function recalling that given to place by Iamblichus as reported by Simplicius.197 In Psellus' excerpts numbers are said to have place as ‘containing ’bodies in their power, a causal rather than a local ‘enclosing ’. Ifnumbers ‘contain ’bodies in this sense, then they also ‘contain ’a connatural part ofbodies, namely place (81–4). The excerpts also ascribe to numbers place in a different sense, that rather of Theophrastus: numbers, as constituting an ordered series, have ‘places ’in the order ofsuccession ofthe series (84 –7). This latter sense ofplace is applied elsewhere by Iamblichus, not only to numbers, but also to other immaterial realities.198 (VII)TheVoid The excerpts in On Physical Number dealﬁnally with a related topic, the void (90 –3). Here Iamblichus seems as ﬁrm as Aristotle ( Phys.IV 6–9) in denying the existence ofa void. This is surprising, since Aristotle includes the void in Pythagorean doctrine,199and IamblichusBOOK V 67 193The ontological importance ofplace is already stressed by Plotinus; corporeal existence (as opposed to incorporeal being) depends on place (cf . e.g . V 9, 5, 44 –9). 194Cf. also Iamblichus, In Tim. fr. 20. 195Cf. Hoffmann (1979) and (1980). 196Simplicius, In phys. 625, 15 ff.; 626, 3 ff. 197Simplicius, In phys. 639, 24 ff. 198Iamblichus, In Parm. fr. 313 (Larsen); cf.

In fact a quali ﬁcation</p></div><p id="page">preserved in the excerpts (92 –3) turns out to be an element of a resolution which can be found, again fully explained, in the later Neoplatonic commentaries on the Physics. Psellus' excerpts concede the existence ofa void, ‘ifone wishes to speak ofeven number as a discontinuous gap ( διεχη ̑...διάκɛνον)’(92–3). The meaning ofthis phrase emerges ifit is compared to Simplicius' and Philoponus' comments on the corresponding section ofAristotle's Physics. Both commentators understand the Pythagorean concept of void reported by Aristotle as referring to the differencebetween Forms, the separation between bodies. Thus the Pythagoreans, in introducing the void, were speaking in factof a principle of differentiation. 200If we recall that in Pythagorean arithmetic the principle of differentiation is the ﬁrst evennumber, the dyad, then the sense ofPsellus' excerpt and its f unction in a reconciliation ofthe Aristotelian and Pythagorean positions emerges: Iamblichus was prepared to defend a Pythagorean concept of void, if by this is meanta principle of differentiation. This enabled him to take Aristotle's side on the question and yet to claim to be faithful toPythagoreanism. (VIII)Conclusion Psellus' excerpts in On Physical Number reveal ﬁnally a good deal about Iamblichus' On Pythagoreanism V. Iamblichus developed here a ‘Pythagorean ’arithmetical physics following the plan of Aristotle's Physics I–IV. One major topic is missing in Psellus, time. Yet we know from another source something about Iamblichus' theory of time, as it waspresented in his Commentary on the Categories in the f orm ofan interpretation ofa text supposedly by the Pythagorean Archytas. 201It is a fair guess that the treatment of time in On Pythagoreanism V would not have been very different. In his Physics Aristotle occasionally criticized the Pythagoreans and Platonists and regarded his own physical theory as superior. Psellus' excerpts contain some indications showing that Iamblichus, far from ignoring Aristotle's criticisms,attempted to68ON PYTHAGOREANISM VlVII IN PSELLUS 200Simplicius, In phys. 652, 7 –19; Philoponus, In phys. 610, 7 –21; cf.

Archytas is cited in In Nic. 6, 20–2, and elsewhere in On Pythagoreanism</p><div id="pagenum"><p>(cf. above, p. 43).</p></div><div id="pagenum"><p>come to terms with them. This involved, in some cases at least, interpretation ofPythagorean doctrine so as to renderit defensible. This may have led to some projection of Aristotelian physics backwards on to Pythagoreanism. At thesame time, however, Iamblichus did not hesitate to go beyond Aristotle, in particular on the subject ofplace. This hedid elsewhere, in the case oftime, by appealing to a supposedly earlier, Pythagorean source, Archytas. Such advanceswere a source of inspiration for the sophisticated theories of place and time to be found in later Neoplatonists,Syrianus, Damascius, and Simplicius. More generally, the instances in which Psellus' excerpts have been found toanticipate speci ﬁc arguments in Simplicius' and Philoponus' commentaries on the Physics suggest that Iamblichus' study</p></div><p id="page">ofthe Physics was ofsome importance f or the development ofthese commentaries. 202 But what arithmetical physics emerges from the excerpts? In general it appears that the physical universe is structuredby immanent forms, called ‘physical numbers ’, which derive their character and behaviour from the properties of mathematical numbers. Mathematical numbers in fact exemplify, in paradigmatic fashion, the organization of theuniverse. This means that physical theory can be found pre-contained in mathematics and that the elements of such atheory are instantiated in the various physical expressions of different mathematical numbers. It is this last idea that ispredominant in Psellus' excerpts: the components ofan (Aristotelian) account ofphysical causality are shown to beembodied in different (physical) numbers or groups of nu mbers. The excerpts give the impression ofa multiplicity and variety ofimmanent f orms expressing the relative simplicity ofphysical theory. Although the latter appears in generalto be Aristotelian, there are differences, at the very least in the case of place: place is an intimate part of the being ofbodies and is produced by numbers (mathematical here, it seems, rather than physical), which possess their ownimmaterial ‘places ’in a serial organization.BOOK V 69 202Simplicius and Philoponus are probably not speci ﬁcally dependent on the reading ofAristotle's Physics given in On Pythagoreanism V. They would have had other sources, in particular Iamblichus' Commentary on the Timaeus. (We know ofno commentary, properly speaking, on the Physics by Iamblichus.) Simplicius, however, would have known Iamblichus' On Pythagoreanism well, if we can trust Renaissance reports of a manuscript (no longer to be found) containing a commentary by him on Iamblichus' book; cf. I.</p><div id="pagenum"><p>Hadot (1987 b), 28 –9. Cf. above, n. 31, below, n. 50, for close verbal parallels between Simplicius and Iamblichus' On Pythagoreanism as excerpted by Psellus.</p></div><div id="pagenum"><p>These results are no doubt incomplete. But to go much further in the attempt to reconstruct Iamblichus' On</p></div><p id="page">Pythagoreanism Book V on the basis ofPsellus' excerpts would, I believe, involve speculations whose degree ofreliability would be hard to measure. 4.OnPythagoreanismVI (I)GeneralPlan Psellus' excerpts in On Ethical and Theological Arithmetic fall into two sections, the ﬁrst having to do with ‘ethical arithmetic ’(2–52), corresponding thus to On Pythagoreanism VI, the second containing ‘theological arithmetic ’(53–90), i.e. the subject-matter of On Pythagoreanism VII. I shall be concerned here with the ﬁrst section and with the extent to which it reveals something ofthe content ofOn Pythagoreanism VI. The task ofreconstruction is yet more dif ﬁcult here than in the case of On Pythagoreanism V: there is only halfas much available in terms ofquantity ofexcerpts, and no related, i.e. ethical, Neoplatonic commentaries survive which could help in elucidating obscure passages.Since it turns out that Iamblichus' ordering ofthe implications ofnumber ‘according to the physical . . . account ’ means in fact that the plan of On Pythagoreanism V follows that of Aristotle's Physics I–IV, one wonders ifthe same sort ofsituation might obtain with respect to the ordering ‘according to the ethical . . . account ’(above, p. 60) in On Pythagoreanism VI. And indeed it does. The sequence oftopics in the ﬁrst part ofPsellus' On Ethical and Theological Arithmetic (2–52) corresponds roughly —with larger omissions, as one would expect with fewer excerpts —to that of Aristotle's ethical treatises: the ﬁrst principles ofethics (2 –15); the parts or powers ofthe soul (16 –23); virtue de ﬁned (24–30); virtues intellectual and moral discussed individually (31 –52). 203For the same reasons as those given above a propos the plan of On Pythagoreanism V, Psellus' excerpts appear to be taken, not from a limited section, but from a range ofchapters in On Pythagoreanism VI. They thus give some idea, however f ragmentary, ofthe structure ofthe work. It is not clear, on the other hand, if Iamblichus follows one particular ethical treatise of Aristotle. He is familiar,as will be seen later, with both the Nicomachean and the Eudemian Ethics. His attitude70 ON PYTHAGOREANISM VlVII IN PSELLUS</p><div id="pagenum"><p>203At least one omission in the excerpts is a treatment off riendship promised in In Nic. 35, 5–10.</p></div><div id="pagenum"><p>to both may have been such that he did not feel bound to follow closely the one rather than the other.204At any rate it</p></div><p id="page">will be useful to keep Aristotle's ethics in mind as Psellus' excerpts are considered in more detail. (II)TheFirstPrinciplesofEthics Aristotle begins his ethics starting from principles, ἀϱχαί. These principles are not ‘absolute ’, i.e. those standing at the head ofa science ofethics that is complete, but ‘relative ’: they are what is at ﬁrst best known to us, those facts that experience teaches and which only a mature student ofethics will possess.205Psellus' excerpts begin, however, with a list ofﬁrst principles which are ‘absolute ’and on which ethics is grounded: measure, limit, perfection, order, unity. They are also mathematical. How they ground ethics can be illustrated from Aristotle's characterization of happiness assomething perfect ( τὸδ′ἄϱιστοντ έλɛιόντιϕαίνɛται), as an activity ofthe soul according to the highest and most perfect virtue, in a perfect or complete life. 206Iamblichus seems to be thinking ofthis description ofhappiness when, on the subject ofthe perf ect as ﬁrst principle, he says: ‘for perfection ( τɛλɛιότης) unitarily completes the best ( ἄϱιστον) measure oflif e ’(Psellus' excerpts, 8). It is not, however, the perfect, but measure, or rather ‘measure itself ’and what is measured that are most important among the mathematical principles ofethics according to Psellus' excerpts (2 –6). Measure and what is measured are in fact what come ﬁrst in the list of ‘possessions ’whereby the human good, i.e. happiness, is constituted according to Plato's Philebus (66 a 6 –7). On the assumption then that the Platonic dialogues are Pythagorean in inspiration, an assumption clearly made in On Pythagoreanism, theﬁrst elements ofthe human good in Plato's Philebus can be considered by Iamblichus as the absolute ﬁrst principles ofa Pythagorean ‘arithmetical ethics ’. In the preceding chapter it was seen that mathematics not only furnishes ethics with its ﬁrst principles. It also has a paradigmatic role in ethics. An example ofthis appears in Psellus' next lines: the ‘mean ’BOOK VI 71 204Cf. Kenny (1978), 38 –9 (similar situation in Simplicius and Philoponus). I shall refer to the Eudemian Ethics only when it is clear that it, and not the Nicomachean Ethics, is being used by Iamblichus. 205Eth. Nic.

(III)ThePowersoftheSoul Having de ﬁned happiness in outline, Aristotle develops his account by means ofa briefdiscussion ofthe soul which yields a distinction between rational and non-rational psychic parts or powers. This produces in turn a differentiationbetween intellectual and moral virtue ( Eth. Nic. I 13). Psellus' extracts contain a corresponding section (16 –23), in which psychic powers are assimilated to numbers. For this purpose Iamblichus uses a text to be found in Aristotle's On the Soul (404 b 22 –4), which he takes elsewhere to refer to Plato, 207and here, presumably, to refer to the Pythagoreans. This text identi ﬁes intellect with the number one, science with two, opinion with three, and sense-perception with four. Iamblichus explains each identi ﬁcation and his explanations correspond exactly to those, given at slightly greater length, ofSimplicius commenting on the same text ofAristotle.208The psychic powers mentioned in the excerpts relate only to the cognitive f unctions ofthe soul, and one must suppose that Iamblichus also treated ofother psychic powersrelevant to a ‘Pythagorean ’ethics, such as those he lists in his work On the Soul : The Platonists, Archytas, and the other Pythagoreans declare the soul to be tripartite, dividing it into reason, spirit,and desire. For these 〈parts〉are useful for the constitution of the virtues. But they reckoned the powers of the soul to include nature, imagination, sense-perception, opinion, the thought that moves bodies, the desire ofthe f airand good, and intellections. 209 This last list contains three ofthe cognitive powers mentioned in Psellus' excerpts, and the passage illustrates howthese powers might have been brought into a discussion ofpsychology with ref erence to ethics in On Pythagoreanism VI. It is at any rate clear that Iamblichus substituted for Aristotle's account of the soul a ‘Pythagorean ’psychology based, in part at least, on reports found in Aristotle himself.72ON PYTHAGOREANISM VlVII IN PSELLUS 207Iamblichus, De an., in Stobaeus, Anth.

On the analogy ofnatural excellence or virtue210and with much recourse to mathematics, Aristotle de ﬁnes moral virtue as a ‘mean ’between two extremes, excess and de ﬁciency ( Eth. Nic. II 6). Psellus' excerpts recall this deﬁnition,211comparing virtue to ‘mean ’and‘perfect ’numbers, and vices to ‘superabundant ’and‘deﬁcient’numbers. Such a comparison had already been made by Nicomachus. Psellus' excerpts, however, concern natural, rather thanmoral virtue (26). They appear to derive from a section on natural functioning and excellence which may haveintroduced, as it does in Aristotle, an account ofethical f unctioning and virtue. 212 Psellus' excerpts continue with a passage (27 –30) putting the unmeasured, the unlimited, etc., in ‘the column ’ofvice. A preceding passage might be missing, in which measure, limit, etc., may have been put in a ‘column ’ofvirtue such as that alluded to in Aristotle.213 Having de ﬁned moral virtue, Aristotle next gives examples ofvirtues as means and vices as extremes ( Eth. Nic. II 7–8). Although there is nothing corresponding to this in Psellus' excerpts, there is an interesting related passage to be foundalready in On Pythagoreanism IV: This agrees . . . with thinking correctly that the virtues are measured states and means between excess anddeﬁciency, and are not extremes . . . , evil opposing evil, and both opposing one good, yet good not at all opposing good, but opposite at the same time to two evils, as cowardice is opposed to audacity . . . and both are opposed tocourage. . . . ( In Nic. 32, 25 –33, 7) Examples follow, taken both from Eth. Nic. II 7 and Eth. Eud. II 3, illustrating Aristotle's point about the oppositions between vices and between them and virtues ( Eth. Nic. II 8, 1108 b 11– 15) as well as his remark in Eth. Nic. II 6, 1106 b 28 ff. on the unity of virtue and the diversity of vice, or, as Iamblichus phrases it, ‘the rarity ofthe perf ect, as belonging to something good and not to some manifold evil ’(In Nic. 33, 15– 17).BOOK VI 73 210Cf.Eth.

It is not clear from Psellus' excerpts here whether they derive from a variety of chapters (each devoted perhaps to a particular virtue) or represent a fairlycontinuous extract from one chapter. It is, however, likely that Iamblichus discussed other virtues besides thoseretained by Psellus (above, n. 45). The group ofvirtues mentioned in Psellus is symptomatic ofthe curious mix ofPlatonic and Aristotelian ethics that will reappear later. The order in which the virtues are treated corresponds roughlyto that used in Plato's Republic (428 a ff.), not that in Aristotle, who deals ﬁrst with moral, and then with intellectual virtues. However, the distinction between practical and theoretical wisdom is Aristotelian, as are the descriptions ofpractical wisdom as concerned with ‘variable matters ’(Psellus, 32) and oftheoretical wisdom as concerned with ‘beings ’. 214The latter is related to the monad and the former to the triad on grounds similar to those given earlier (17–18) for the assimilation of intellect to one and opinion to the triad. Two forms of courage are distinguished in Psellus' excerpts, ‘manly ’courage and constancy (37 –8). The former comes from Plato ( Laws802 e 9, Symp.192 a 4–5). So does the latter, as can be seen from Iamblichus' Letter to Olympius, where it is related to courage as de ﬁned in the Republic.215In this Letter, however, Aristotelian courage is also present: as Aristotle's courageous man endures pain and danger ‘for the sake of the fair ’, so does Iamblichus' paragon support such things ‘for the sake of the good ’.216The slight difference in formulation points to what one feels must separate the two models of courage: Iamblichus' man appears more indifferent to and unperturbed by the trials of this world thanAristotle's, based as his courage is on unchanging thought ﬁxed on an otherworldly goal. For the two forms of courage, manliness and constancy, Psellus' excerpts give numerical analogues (37 –8), the odd (always male in Pythagoreanism, as the even was female) and the foursquare —the latter is Aristotle's comparison ( Eth. Nic. 1100 b 11–22).74 ON PYTHAGOREANISM VlVII IN PSELLUS 214τὰὄντα(34); compare Aristotle's τιμιώτατα(Eth. Nic. 1139 a 5 –11, 1141 a 20, 1141 b 3). 215Iamblichus in Stobaeus, Anth.

Given the strongly mathe matical character ofAristotle's treatment ofthis virtue, it is hardly surprising to ﬁnd Iamblichus following him more closely here. Aristotle ﬁrst describes distributive and recti ﬁcatory justice and then introduces ( Eth. Nic. V 5) Pythagorean ‘reciprocal ’justice. In his Letter to Anatolius Iamblichus presents an Aristotelian theory ofdistributive justice.219Only reciprocal justice is represented however in Psellus' excerpts (46 ff.). Iamblichus replaces Aristotle's brief reference to this as a Pythagorean concept with aPythagorean de ﬁnition ofreciprocal justice cited by Nicomachus. 220But Nicomachus' de ﬁnition is slightly altered: the term ἀπόδοσικat the beginning ofthe de ﬁnition becomes ἀνταπ όδοσιςin Psellus' excerpts (46), under the in ﬂuence perhaps ofAristotle's ref erences to τὸἀντιπ ɛπονθόςorἀνταπ όδοσιςin Pythagoreanism ( Eth. Nic. 1133 a 3, 1132 b 21). In relating justice to the number four (or ﬁve), however, (48) Iamblichus does little more than follow a well-established Pythagorean tradition.221 (VI)Conclusion To judge from Psellus' excerpts, it seems that Iamblichus again followed Aristotle's lead in On Pythagoreanism VI. Here it is Aristotle's ethics that provides the lines on which Iamblichus elaborated aBOOK VI 75 217Cf. Iamblichus in Stobaeus, Anth. III 257, 11 –258, 4; Plato, Rep.431 e 8, 442 c 10 –d 1, but also Aristotle, Eth. Nic. 1119 b 15 –16. 218Cf. the references given below, Appendix I, ad loc. 219In Stobaeus, Anth. III 358, 5 –17 (cf.

Blumenthal ( 1984) and the</p><div id="pagenum"><p>references given there.</p></div><div id="pagenum"><p>‘Pythagorean arithmetical ethics ’. In view ofthe small amount ofmaterial excerpted by Psellus, it is likely that many</p></div><p id="page">topics ofAristotelian ethics were covered by Iamblichus, ofwhich there is no trace in Psellus. Aristotle's in ﬂuence on the ethics of On Pythagoreanism VI has been observed not only in the sequence oftopics handled, but also in particular explanations and even in individual expressions. However Iamblichus attempted to change Aristotelian ethics into a‘Pythagorean ’theory. This could be done by emphasizing the mathematical aspects ofAristotle's approach —in particular his discussions ofmoral virtue in general and ofthe virtue ofjustice —or by substituting Pythagorean deﬁnitions and theories where appropriate —e.g. on the parts or powers ofthe soul. Plato's ethics was also introduced as was, ofcourse, Pythagorean numerical lore. The theory that emerges is structurally similar to the arithmeticalphysics of On Pythagoreanism V: the ﬁrst principles, models, and concepts ofethics are f ound already in the various mathematical properties ofnumbers. Not only are the basic notions ofethics mathematical in inspiration, but speci ﬁc virtues are paradigmatically contained in speci ﬁc numbers. To judge correctly the overall impression given in Psellus' excerpts ofa conf usion between arithmetic and ethics, it is well to recall the care with which Iamblichus had stressedbefore in On Pythagoreanism (above, p. 48) the distinction between the sciences, as well as the applicability of mathematics outside its proper domain. The same methodological point will be made in Psellus' excerpts from the nextbook of On Pythagoreanism. 5.OnPythagoreanismVII (I)GeneralPlan In coming to Psellus' excerpts from On Pythagoreanism VII, where he ﬁnally divulges his source (53 ff.), we reach matters which Iamblichus had presented earlier (above, p. 48) as the subject aimed at by, and transcendingmathematics, namely pure beings and the divine. Ifthis subject is not treated in its own right in On Pythagoreanism VII, it is at least adumbrated, to the extent that arithmetic f oreshadows and leads to the study ofbeing and ofthe divine.From this point-of-view On Pythagoreanism VII represents, in the scheme ofthe work as a whole, the highest stage in</p><div id="pagenum"><p>the ascent ofthe soul ofthe reader. In approaching76ON PYTHAGOREANISM VlVII IN PSELLUS</p></div><div id="pagenum"><p>the summit ofPythagorean philosophy, it also points to the goal ofOn Pythagoreanism itself, allowing us to view the</p></div><p id="page">work as a whole in relation to its ﬁnality. Unfortunately, but not surprisingly, it is also here that Psellus' excerpts are most de ﬁcient. They are fewer than before and sometimes extremely fragmentary. No general plan is evident. Psellus seems to have cared even less than before about what he was excerpting, and the relevance (and, presumably, danger)ofthe theological material to Christianity did not escape his notice (cf . 71). But what he does excerpt contains someimportant clues.Ifno general plan is evident in the sequence ofPsellus' excerpts, it appears at least that they are taken, as bef ore, f romvarious parts of On Pythagoreanism VII. A striking example is the passage at 59 –63 which, as it stands, has little to do with the preceding and succeeding sections. A great deal ofcontext must be supplied ifsome continuity is to beestablished between it and the other excerpts.Since Iamblichus followed the general order of Aristotle's physics and ethics in organizing the previous two books ofOn Pythagoreanism, one wonders ifsomething similar might be the case here too, particularly in view ofthe f act that an Aristotelian work concerning being and the divine was available, the Metaphysics. A direct comparison ofPsellus' excerpts with the Metaphysics does not at ﬁrst glance reveal any relation. If, however, we apply a method used above in section 3, comparing Psellus' excerpts with a later Neoplatonic commentary on theMetaphysics, we come upon some interesting connections. The debt ofSyrianus' Commentary on the Metaphysics to Iamblichus' On Pythagoreanism will be demonstrated below in Chapter 6. Here I would like to refer brie ﬂy to part of Syrianus' attempt to respond in his commentary to Aristotle's onslaught in Metaphysics MN on Platonic theories of separately existing Forms, numbers, or ‘ideal numbers ’(ɛἰδητικο ὶἀϱιθμοί). In N4 Aristotle presents a dilemma: given their metaphysical theories, his opponents are in a position neither to subordinate ‘the Good ’to‘the One ’, nor to identify them, since this would produce an absurd plethora of goods. Syrianus, on the contrary, has no dif ﬁculty with a plethora ofgoods (the divine af ter all is without envy) and theref ore maintains against Aristotle the identity ofthe Onewith the Good. 222The passage at 59 –63 in Psellus' excerpts, which, as noted above, appears to have nothing in common with the other excerpts, discusses the difference between the Good and the One and compares theBOOK VII 77</p><div id="pagenum"><p>222In met. 181, 34 –185, 27, especially 183, 26 –9.</p></div><div id="pagenum"><p>multiplication ofthe One with the multiplication ofthe Good. In the case ofthe latter this multiplication relates to thenature ofthe Good, which is generative ( γόνιμοςο ὐ̑σα, 60). The connection between these themes and Syrianus'</p></div><p id="page">commentary suggests a possible context for Psellus' excerpt: a reaction to a speci ﬁc argument forming part of Aristotle's rejection ofseparately existing Forms or numbers in Metaphysics MN. 223This context would disclose in turn the relation between this excerpt and the other excerpts, which have to do with ‘ideal’and‘divine ’numbers. Ifthese conjectures about the original context ofthe excerpt at 59 –63 are correct, they would show that at some point inOn Pythagoreanism VII Iamblichus came to terms, to some extent, with Aristotle's criticisms ofPlatonic theories of Forms or ‘ideal numbers ’. Ifsome compromise or adjustment was possible between Aristotle and Pythagoreanism —Platonism in the realms ofphysics and ethics, it was hardly so when Iamblichus came to the subjects ofAristotle's Metaphysics.224In order to present a science ofseparately existing ideal and divine numbers, Iamblichus would have to overcome the arguments in Metaphysics MN. However, there is no other trace ofthis response to Aristotle in Psellus' excerpts,225and it may not have been a major preoccupation in On Pythagoreanism VII. There is no trace, either, in Psellus' excerpts ofa positive theory of‘ideal ’or‘intelligible ’numbers corresponding to the Forms, which Iamblichus could have presented in conjunction with his response to Aristotle, although earlierreferences maylead one to expect such a theory in On Pythagoreanism VII. 226The excerpts concern almost entirely a sort of number which appears to be different, ‘divine ’number. The approach used by Iamblichus in treating ofthis sort of number will emerge as its nature is examined.78ON PYTHAGOREANISM VlVII IN PSELLUS 223It is not clear which, ifeither, horn ofAristotle's dilemma Iamblichus accepted. The emphasis on multiplication points to Syrianus' position, yet t he excerpt speaks of ‘difference ’(perhaps Psellus' word). Cf. Iamblichus, De myst. 261, 9 –14 (quoted below, p. 82). Did Iamblichus produce a commentary on Aristotle's Metaphysics ? Dillon (1973), 22, does not provide suf ﬁcient evidence ofsuch a commentary. However Simplicius, In de an. 217, 23 –8 (referred to by Steel [1978 ], 124) indicates that Iamblichus discussed at least the σκοπός(goal or intention) of Met.Λ(cf. also the scholium on Iamblichus, Pr.22, 1 ff. printed at Pr.127, 16 –19). 224Cf. Syrianus' general assessment of Aristotle ( In met. 80, 4–81, 6; discussed below, Ch. 6). 225Syrianus cites On Pythagoreanism VII while discussing Met. M, 8(In met. 140, 2 –15), but not in such a way as to imply that Iamblichus was also dealing with the Aristotelian passage.</p><div id="pagenum"><p>226Cf. above, pp. 60, 62 (but the references are a little vague, and the title of Book VII includes no reference to an ‘ideal’[ɛἰδητικ ός] arithmetic).</p></div><div id="pagenum"><p>(II)DivineNumber</p></div><p id="page">Psellus' theological excerpts begin with a summary and a quotation (53 –8) emphasizing the transcendence of ‘divine number ’in relation to other sorts ofnumber, ‘hypostatic ’(= mathematical?), ‘self-moved ’(= psychic),227intellectual (νοɛϱός), essential (οὐσιώδης, i.e.: ideal or intelligible)228number. The sorts of numbers listed correspond to different and ascending degrees ofreality. A roughly equivalent list, this time given in descending order, appears already in On Pythagoreanism III, where the Pythagoreans are said to ‘ﬁt’mathematicals (including numbers) to the gods, ‘to their being and power, order and activities, according to an appropriate assimilation —what they thought especially worthwhile —ﬁnding which numbers are related and similar to which gods ’; then to the intellectual ( τὸνοɛϱον), pure being, i.e. ideal ( ɛἰδητικ όν) number; then to self-moved existence, de ﬁned as self-moved number; then to the heavens and to enmattered forms, i.e. physical numbers ( Comm. 63, 23 –64, 19). The ‘intellectual ’and the ‘intelligible ’(pure being) are treated as one in this passage, although they are distinguished in Psellus. But a report in Syrianus con ﬁrms that Iamblichus wished to distinguish them in On Pythagoreanism VII: Since, when they discuss the divine monads, they de ﬁne differently the intelligible monad ( νοητὴν...μον άδα)fr o m which comes forth the very ﬁrst number . . . , from the intellectual and demiurgic monad ( νοɛϱὰνκ αὶ δημιου ϱγικήν) . . . concerning which 〈monads〉many ofthe ancient and more recent 〈authorities 〉have spoken, but most clearly ofall the divine Iamblichus in the seventh book ofhis Pythagorean treatise.229 Thus in On Pythagoreanism VII Iamblichus was more precise than in the earlier books concerning the difference between levels ofreality: above the world ofenmattered f orms (physical numbers) were to be f ound ‘hypostatic number ’(?), self-moved being (or number), intellectual being (or number), intelligible or pure being or the Forms (ideal number), and, transcending all, the gods (or divine number).There is another, more striking difference between the passage in Book III and Psellus' excerpt at 53 –8. The former text calls for an extrapolation upwards of mathematics, ‘according to an appropriateBOOK VII 79 227Cf. Iamblichus, In Tim. fr. 55, 12 –13, and above, p. 62. 228Cf. Psellus, On Phys.

Hadot (1968), I 98 –101.</p></div><div id="pagenum"><p>assimilation ( ἀπɛικασία)’, towards the divine, whereas the text ofPsellus presents the hierarchy ofsorts ofnumber with</p></div><p id="page">the purpose ofstressing the transcendence ofthe divine and thus ofdenying such extrapolations ( οὔτɛἀναλογ ίαις ἀπɛικάςων, 55). The con ﬂict can be resolved by reference to Psellus' excerpts at 81– 7: assimilation upwards to the divine unities ( ἑνώσɛις) ofthe ‘natural sequence ’(or‘ﬂow’) ofnumbers is an inf erior approach, an analogy. A more accurate approach would consist in starting, not from below, but from the divine itself; this method depends, itappears, not on analogy, but on ‘higher insight ’. 230This difference in approach seems to be followed in Psellus' excerpts. Having emphasized the transcendence ofdivine number (54 –8), they discuss divine number on the basis ofthe inf erior mathematical analogies (64 –80), and then refer to the superior, direct insight into divine number (84 –7). What has already been learnt from Psellus' excerpts (81 –7) about the approach by analogy points to an agenda: relating the numbers ofthe natural sequence ofnumbers (i.e. f rom the mo nad to the decad) to the gods. This programme is also followed in the excerpts relating to mathematical analogy: they discuss successively the monad (70 –5), dyad (75 –8), and triad (78 –80). Had Psellus cared to excerpt more, we would in all likelihood ﬁnd the subsequent numbers ofthe decad also represented.I believe that we are now in a position to draw some tentative conclusions about the structure of On Pythagoreanism VII. Iamblichus may have treated in this work ofideal or intelligible number, at least to the extent that he may haveresponded in some measure to Aristotle's attack on theories ofseparately existing Forms or ideal numbers inMetaphysics MN. Although Iamblichus clearly believed in the distinct reality ofideal numbers, he was especially concerned in On Pythagoreanism VII with a higher sort ofnumber, ‘divine number ’. To deal with this subject he took up again the traditional Pythagorean decadic order ofexposition, such as was used by Nicomachus in his Theologoumena arithmeticae, ﬁtting each number, from monad to decad, to the gods. If we wish to speculate about what works Iamblichus would have used here, we can say that they certainly did not include Aristotle's Metaphysics, but probably were traditional Pythagorean works on the decad such as are re ﬂected in Anatolius' piece and used by Nicomachus' Theologoumena. One ofthese might have been the Pythagorean Sacred Discourse to which Syrianus refers in connection80 ON PYTHAGOREANISM VlVII IN PSELLUS</p><div id="pagenum"><p>230κατὰκϱɛίττους ἐννοίας(87). Cf. above, p. 47.</p></div><div id="pagenum"><p>with his mention ofIamblichus' On Pythagoreanism VII.231However, Iamblichus considered the method by mathematical</p></div><p id="page">analogy inferior to direct insight into the gods, a subject on which he also touched to some degree.At the same time a certain amount has been learnt concerning the structure ofreality presented in On Pythagoreanism VII. A more precise picture ofthis structure emerges than that f ound in earlier books ofthe work. The earlier lack ofclarity about whether or not the divine and pure being are distinct is removed: 232the level ofpure being (or the intelligible) is inferior to the level of the gods which is beyond being. So also does a distinction between the intelligibleand the intellectual levels, scarcely drawn earlier, clearly emerge in On Pythagoreanism VII. This structure ofreality is not, however, complete. In what follows I shall attempt to ﬁll it out further, to the extent that Psellus' excerpts permit. (III)TheApproachbyAnalogy Most ofPsellus' theological excerpts (64 –80) relate to this subject. They are not for all that particularly representative or informative. Their defectiveness and the amount of omission will become clearer as they are studied in detail.The excerpts ﬁrst suggest that Iamblichus presented a broad analogy between what is highest in numbers (the one, limit, equality) and the divine (64 –6). This corresponds to the broad assimilations between numbers and enmattered forms ( On Phys. Numb. 8–12), and between numbers and virtue ( On Eth. and Theol. Arith. 24–30) which introduced the more detailed accounts ofphysical and ethical arithmetic in On Pythagoreanism V–VI. This is followed in Psellus' excerpts by some lines (66 –70) having to do with the cause or principle ( ἀϱχή) ofdivine number. The correspondence between this and the identi ﬁcation ofcauses and ﬁrst principles in physical and ethical arithmetic is pointed out. Thus prior to uni ﬁed divine number is to be found a ‘uniform unity ’(μονο ɛιδὴςἕνωσις). The language used here implies that despite its unity, divine number (or the divine) 233presupposes a cause ofits unity which, as such, must be prior and superior to it ( κατ ′αἰτίανπϱοηγουμ ένη).BOOK VII 81 231In met. 140, 16 –18, and above, p. 20, below, p. 93. 232Cf. above, Ch. 2 n. 46.</p><div id="pagenum"><p>233Cf. also 81 –4, where the ‘supernatural ’beings are described as unities, ἑνώσɛις.</p></div><div id="pagenum"><p>This is a f undamental addition to the structure ofreality sketched above: prior to and above the level ofthe gods(themselves ‘above ’being) is an ultimate principle ofthe unity ofthe gods.</p></div><p id="page">Something very similar can be found in Iamblichus' On Mysteries. Here, in one passage, Iamblichus speaks ofascending degrees ofunity ( ἕνωσις) and being, culminating with the gods: As for the gods, their order consists in the unity ( ἑνώσɛι) ofall; their primary and secondary classes and their many products all came to be in unity. The all in them is the One; the ‘beginning, middle, and end ’come to be according to the One. 234 If it is not clear from this passage that the gods are above being and depend themselves on a higher principle for theirunity, this can be shown from a later passage of On Mysteries : Before true beings and the universal causes there is one god, the very ﬁrst, even before the ﬁrst god and king, remaining unchanging in the singleness ofhis unity. There is nothing intelligible or otherwise added to him. He isthe model of . . . the one father god, the true good, for he is something greater and the ﬁrst and the source ofall. . . . From this One the self-suf ﬁcient god shone himselff orth ...,fo rh e 〈the latter〉 is cause and god ofgods, monad from the One, prior to being and ca üse ofbeing. 235 Certain aspects ofthis text are clari ﬁed in a comparison with Psellus' excerpts, notably the expression ‘god ofgods ’: this indicates that the ﬁrst god arising from the ultimate One is the source of the other gods, or, in arithmetical terms, the monad ofdivine number. On the other hand the text of On Mysteries suggests a possible reason why Psellus, in his excerpts, appears to have compared the ﬁrst ofthe gods (rather than its source, the ultimate One) with the Christian god.236Had Iamblichus used expressions such as those used in On Mysteries ofthe ﬁrst ofthe gods, e.g. ‘ﬁrst god and king’, a superﬁ cial reader could82 ON PYTHAGOREANISM VlVII IN PSELLUS 23459, 15 –60, 2. The Pythagorean motto is cited also in Psellus, On Eth. Theol. Arith. 72. 235261, 9 –262, 5 (Festugière [1950 –4 ], IV 23 ff., has noted the Pythagorean character of this text). The same structure, in its basic features, is attributed to Iamblichus by Damascius (using Iamblichus' Commentary on the ‘Chaldaean Oracles ’),De princ. I 86, 3 ff. P. Hadot's argument (1968), I 97 n. 1, against the rapprochement of the texts in De myst. and in Damascius does not note that the monad named in Damascius is intelligible, which makes the principle above it equivalent to the supra-intelligible monad (or ‘god ofgods ’)o f De myst., and the principle yet above it the same as the ultimate One, cause ofthe ‘god ofgods ’inDe myst.</p><div id="pagenum"><p>236Cf. lines 70 –2, discussed immediately below.</p></div><div id="pagenum"><p>have easily taken this to be equivalent to the highest Christian principle.We have already moved in Psellus' excerpts from the ultimate One, cause ofthe unity ofdivine number, to the ﬁrst of</p></div><p id="page">the series ofdivine numbers, the ‘ﬁrst god ’. It is referred to as ‘theﬁrst’, the ‘one’,a‘henad ’, and ‘triad’(70–1). The latter description shows, unless Psellus' excerpting is seriously misleading here, that Iamblichus is referring to the ﬁrst ofthe gods and not to the ultimate One. Describing it as a triad is to indicate, by means ofa Pythagorean motto (72,cf. above, n. 76), its dependence on a principle of unity. Is the term ‘henad’ equivalent to the term ‘monad ’used in On Mysteries ofthe ﬁrst god? The structural correspondence between the systems of On Mysteries and ofPsellus' excerpts suggests that it is, but the excerpts themselves do not yield speci ﬁc evidence con ﬁrming this. 237Ifhowever Iamblichus organized his discourse about the gods on the analogy with the decadic series, one would expect that he would beginby reference to the ﬁrst ofthe gods as monad. And Iamblichus, it appears, did ref er to a divine monad, f or Psellus' excerpts list monads at lower levels —an intelligible monad, a demiurgic monad, an earthly (physical) monad (73 –5). Since the treatment ofthe ‘divine ’dyad is followed by a similar list of lower levels of dyads (75 –8), the list ofmonads must also have been headed by reference to a divine monad in Iamblichus. But Psellus omits this, which makes hisexcerpting here particularly obscure and disjointed.Once the monad in the decadic series was applied by analogy to the gods, more especially (and quite probably) to theﬁrst ofthe gods, source ofthe other gods, and himselforiginating f rom the ultimate One, we would expect that the other numbers in the series, dyad, triad, etc., would have been brought by Iamblichus into relation with the series ofthe gods. Ofthis, however, Psellus preserves only a f ew lines concerning the dyad and triad. The ‘divine ’dyad is described as ‘unlimited power, never failing progression of life, receiving the measure of the ﬁrst one ( ὑποδοχ ὴτου ̑ πϱώτουἑνὸςμέτϱου)’(76–7). The ‘ﬁrst one ’is perhaps the ﬁrst god, or henad (cf. 70 –1), a monad also, it seems. The two principles produce the subsequent gods, as monad and dyad, principles oflimit and lack oflimit, produce thef ollowing members ofthe numerical series. The description ofthe divine dyadBOOK VII 83 237In a reference slightly later (86) to the gods as the ‘divine one and ( καὶ) divine monad and divine dyad ...,’theﬁrst‘and’might possibly indicate a distinction.

The latter is alluded to in the list oflower dyadic principles next given in the excerpts: intelligible, intellectual,mathematical, and physical dyads (77 –8). Psellus omits any reference to a ‘divine ’triad, as he did in the case ofthe divine monad, contenting himselfwith excerpting f rom the second part ofIamblichus' account, i.e. that concerning thelower triadic levels. Intelligible, intellectual, supra-celestial, celestial, and physical triads are listed (78 –80). (IV)Conclusion I have summarized above what can reasonably be deduced from Psellus' excerpts concerning the general plan of On Pythagoreanism VII. It will suf ﬁce here to review the main features of the metaphysical theory suggested by the excerpts. The structure ofreality in Iamblichus' On Pythagoreanism VII turns out to be quite complicated, as compared to the system expressed in earlier volumes ofthe work. Above the level ofthe physical world is a series ofdistinct andascending orders, psychic/mathematical, intellectual, intelligible (true being), the divine above being, and above allorders an ultimate One, the absolute ﬁrst principle. As numbers in the mathematical order can be projected downwards paradigmatically, producing physical numbers, so they can be projected upwards as fore-shadowing higherorders, producing, in particular, divine numbers. Our excerpts show no trace ofa positive theory ofintelligible beingapproached mathematically (i.e. ideal numbers), nor are the relations between psychic, mathematical, and intellectualorders clari ﬁed. But this may simply be due to wholesale omissions by Psellus. On the other hand a certain amount is disclosed about the analogy established between numbers and the order ofthe gods. This order, describedmathematically as divine number, is characterize d by unity, both ofthe order itself( ἡνωμένουπαντ ὸςἀϱιθμου ̑,6 9–70) and ofthe gods in the order ( ἑνώ;σɛις, 83). It thus presupposes a principle ofunity transcending it, an ultimate One. The order ofthe gods is treated as a numerical series which ﬂows out from its ﬁrst member, the ‘ﬁrst one ’(a monad), or rather from the interrelation of the two ﬁrst members, monad and dyad, acting as principles oflimit (or measure) and power limited (or measured). From monad and dyad emerge the ﬁrst numbers, properly speaking, and so also by84</p><div id="pagenum"><p>ON PYTHAGOREANISM VlVII IN PSELLUS</p></div><div id="pagenum"><p>analogy do the f ollowing members ofthe order ofthe gods. Few details concerning this survive, however, in Psellus'excerpts. Psellus does retain traces ofIamblichus' illustrations, f or each member ofthe divine decad, oflower instancescorresponding to each ofthe levels ofreality taken in descending sequence. The penetration ofmonad, dyad, triadthrough all levels ofexistence expresses not only the continuity ofthe structure, but also the extra-mathematicalapplicability ofmathematical concepts. The limitations implicit in the latter idea are brought out in Psellus' lastexcerpts. Iamblichus is well aware, as we have seen, that his ‘arithmetical theology ’, his numerical analysis ofthe order</p></div><p id="page">ofthe gods who transcend being, is an extrapolation, an analogy. It is inf erior to a direct ‘meta ’-mathematical insight into the nature ofthe gods, whatever that may be.How does Iamblichus' On Pythagoreanism VII, as reconstructed from Psellus' excerpts, compare with Nicomachus' Theologoumena arithmeticae ? More generally, how does the Pythagoreanizing programme expressed in Iamblichus' work</p><div id="pagenum"><p>compare to that to be found in Nicomachus? Of what importance is this programme in Iamblichus' otherphilosophical writings? These and other related questions will be taken up in the next chapter.BOOK VII 85</p></div><div id="pagenum"><p>4Iamblichus'WorkonPythagoreanism:General</p></div><p id="page">Conclusions In the preceding two chapters the overall intentions and structure ofIamblichus' work On Pythagoreanism have been examined as they appear in the ﬁrst four extant books and in so far as they can be discovered in Psellus' excerpts from Books V –VII. It remains to review brie ﬂy the results achieved and to attempt some assessment ofthe signi ﬁcance of the work as a whole, in relation both to Iamblichus' other works and interests and to the earlier versions ofPythagoreanism sketched above in Chapter 1. The importance ofIamblichus' Pythagoreanizing programme f or thelater history ofGreek philosophy will be the subject ofPart II ofthis book.But have we reached, even with the help ofPsellus' excerpts, an adequate view ofthe work On Pythagoreanism as a whole? There were after all three further books (Books VIII –X) concerning which next to nothing is known. Might they not, were they to resurface some day, alter our general picture of the work? The last three books concernedgeometry, music, and astronomy ‘according to the Pythagoreans ’. In the general scheme ofthe work they occupied positions comparable to that ofBook IV, the Nicomachean introduction to arithmetic. We can theref ore expect thatthey would have been similar in function and character: elementary introductions to the remaining three mathematicalsciences, using ‘Pythagorean ’sources. But I think we can go further than this. Iamblichus might have composed, for Books VIII –X, new elementary introductions to geometry, music, and astronomy, on occasion citing ‘Pythagorean ’authorities. It is more likely, however, that he would have reissued ‘Pythagorean ’introductions to these sciences ifsuch were available, as he did in the case ofNicomachus' Introduction to Arithmetic (= Book IV). And certainly such introductions were available to him.</p><div id="pagenum"><p>But one can only speculate about precisely which ones he would have used. Given his high standing as a Pythagoreanin Iamblichus' eyes, Nicomachus would seem the most likely author he would have chosen and there is</p></div><div id="pagenum"><p>some evidence that Nicomachus wrote introductions to mathematical sciences other than arithmetic. Nicomachushimselfref ers to an Introduction to Geometry in his Introduction to Arithmetic (83, 3 ff.). His brief Manual ofHarmonics refers</p></div><p id="page">to a larger work on harmonics or music which is in all probability one ofthe major Greek sources ofBoethius' De Musica. And ﬁnally Simplicius refers to a Pythagorean discovery in astronomy reported by Iamblichus ‘following Nicomachus ’. 238It is not certain however that Simplicius is inspired, directly or indirectly, by On Pythagoreanism X, or that his report means that Nicomachus wrote an Introduction to Astronomy which Iamblichus used. Whatever Pythagorean materials Iamblichus had recourse to in On Pythagoreanism VIII–X, I think we can safely say that these volumes were elementary introductions to the three mathematical sciences subordinate to arithmetic. It is thusnot likely that they would have signi ﬁcantly altered the system ofPythagorean philosophy or the Pythagorean structure ofreality as these are presented in Books I –VII. From the point ofview ofIamblichus' reader, the highest stage in his philosophical progress is reached, not in the ﬁnal books, but in Book VII where a transition is prepared from the realm ofmathematical science to the highest levels ofPythagorean philosophy. 1.OnPythagoreanism:ABriefReview Despite the quantity and variety ofmaterials used in On Pythagoreanism —Platonic, Pythagorean, Aristotelian texts —a unity ofconception and ofpurpose has been f ound to organize the whole. The work is a protreptic to ‘Pythagorean philosophy ’, leading the reader from more familiar, ‘common ’truths up towards the higher ‘mysteries ’of Pythagoreanism. This movement from the familiar to the transcendent has been observed not only within Book II (theProtreptic ) but also in the other books. Book I ( On the Pythagorean Life ) already begins the initiation ofthe reader in providing evidences ofthe divine origin ofPythagoreanism and in using the actions and speeches ofPythagoras toA BRIEF REVIEW 87 238Simplicius, In De caelo 507, 12 –14 = Iamblichus, fr. 154 Larsen.

The initiation to mathematics proceeds step-by-step. The general introduction in Book III leads to speci ﬁc, more technical introductions to each ofthe f our mathematical sciences (Books IV, VIII –X). From the system ofPythagorean philosophy just alluded to, it will be seen that On Pythagoreanism covers only the ﬁrst, lower halfofwhat Iamblichus considers to be Pythagorean philosophy, namely mathematics. Were it to cover the whole, it would have to deal, afterBook X, with true being and (especially) with the divine. However, these higher regions ofPythagoreanism areforeshadowed in Book VII where an analogy is developed between arithmetic and the gods who transcend being.Within the work a conception ofPythagorean philosophy emerges which is consistent on the whole, although somedetails, especially those having to do with the structure ofreality, are expressed at ﬁrst somewhat vaguely and appear to receive precise formulation, if at all, only in the later books. 239But this is a consequence ofthe order ofexposition, i.e. that ofa gradual ascent, chosen by Iamblichus f or his work.The ﬁgure ofPythagoras is presented at the beginning ofthe work with the purpose, I have suggested, of recommending Pythagorean philosophy to the reader by providing evidence ofits divine origin. Iamblichus collects thelegends associated with Pythagoras. But he also indicates his opinion ofthem: he is concerned with the origin andmission ofPythagoras' soul.Pythagoras' soul is in f act one ofthe souls ofthe divine company ofPlato's Phaedrus which parades above the rim ofthe heavens and contemplates the immaterial Forms, or true being. Pythagoras' soul does notfall from this vision, but is sent down to the material world to impart knowledge to the fallen souls of those who havelost it, thus saving them. This interpretation represents, I have argued, an integration ofthe Pythagorean legend intoIamblichus' Neoplatonic view ofthe origin and purpose ofsoul in the world.88ON PYTHAGOREANISM: GENERAL CONCLUSIONS 239Cf. for example the distinction between being and the divine in Books I, III, VII (above, pp. 45, 81).

Themathematical sciences are inferior to the study of being and the divine, because they deal with inferior objects.Mathematical objects may, through their immateriality and unchangingness, transcend the material world, but they areproducts, images, oftrue being. This means, however, that mathematics can train and prepare the soul, as indicated inPlato's Republic, for higher wisdom. Although subordinate, mathematics has a pivotal role. In view ofthe organization ofthe material world according tonumber, mathematics includes in paradigmatic f orm a theory ofphysics and ofethics as well as f oreshadowing thehighest Pythagorean science. These extra-mathematical implications ofmathematics are introduced in Book III of On Pythagoreanism and became the objects ofseparate and detailed treatment in Books V– VII. In Book V Iamblichus developed a Pythagorean arithmetical physics, that is, a ‘Pythagorean ’reformulation of Aristotelian physics, in which Aristotelian criticisms ofPythagorean ideas were met and ‘Pythagorean ’improvements ofAristotle's theories were introduced. Given the paradigmatic relation between numbers and the forms immanent in, and organizing the materialworld, the latter were described as ‘physical numbers ’and were shown, in their instantiation ofphysical theory, to exhibit the various characteristics ofmathematical number. The same ‘Pythagoreanizing ’ofAristotelian theory, in this case ethics, was attempted in Book VI, the same sorts ofassociations sought between aspects ofethical behaviour andthe mathematical properties ofnumber. When the reader came t o Book VII, he moved from these extrapolations of Pythagorean mathematics to lower sciences, upwards to mathematics as anticipating the highest objects ofPythagoreanphilosophy, the gods. Here Aristotle could scarcely be adapted (Pythagoreanized) for the purpose. A response had tobe made to criticisms in the Metaphysics, and advantage was taken ofthe mathematical properties ofnumber in order to f oreshadow, by a method ofanalogy, the series ofthe gods.This system ofsciences 240corresponds to a structure ofreality whichA BRIEF REVIEW 89</p><div id="pagenum"><p>240The place ofpsychology in the system remains obscure.

But the relation between the two sciences (and their respective objects) isnot clearly determined in the available evidence.</p></div><div id="pagenum"><p>is most fully and precisely presented at the highest stage in the ‘ascent ’ofthe reader, namely in Book VII. The major</p></div><p id="page">aspects ofthe structure appear to be the f ollowing. There is an absolute ﬁrst principle, an ultimate ‘One’above, as presupposed by, the unity ofa series ofgods. This series possesses unity in itselfand in each ofits members. On theanalogy with a numerical series the divine series originates from its ﬁrst members, a ‘ﬁrst one ’(perhaps also described as a‘monad ’) and a divine dyad. Acting together as principles oflimit and ofthe power limited, these two generate the f ollowing members ofthe divine order. The order ofthe gods (or ‘divine number ’, in mathematical analogy) transcends the level ofpure being, the intelligible, ‘ideal’number, in which monad, dyad, and triad are also found, presumably again in virtue ofmathematical analogy. Distinct and inf erior to the intelligible is an ‘intellectual ’level, concerning which little is said in what survives of On Pythagoreanism, apart from the idea that here too analogues of monad, dyad, triad are to be found. Below this level comes ‘mathematical reality ’whose characteristics have served to describe by analogy the higher orders. Proximate in some way to mathematical reality is soul, but the relations betweenthese two orders remain obscure. Below soul and mathematical number is the multiplicity ofenmattered f orms(‘physical numbers ’) which organize the material world and where again analogues ofmonad, dyad, etc. occur. The structure as a whole represents not only ontological distinctions between types ofreality, but also an ontologicalsubordination of these types and a causal derivation going from the higher to the lower, from the ultimate One downeventually to the material world. The details ofthe derivation ofreality are not clear, although the ‘ﬂow’ofnumbers from the ﬁrst two members ofthe decad was, it seems, an important model f or explaining derivation. Ifa briefcomparison is made between Iamblichus' ‘Pythagorean ’structure ofreality and the system ofhypostases in Plotinus, it will be noted that Iamblichus has introduced new ontological distinctions and levels, namely an order ofgods interposed between the ultimate principle and pure being, and an ‘intellectual ’order distinguished from and inferior to pure being or the intelligible. 241The evidence does not reveal the reasons for such introductions into the Neoplatonic system ofreality. It will also be noted that, in contrast to Plotinus,90ON PYTHAGOREANISM: GENERAL CONCLUSIONS 241For Iamblichus as anticipating Proclus' theory of ‘henads’ , cf. below, Ch. 10 n. 25; for the difference between Porphyry and Iamblichus on the intelligible/intellectual</p><div id="pagenum"><p>distinction cf. above, Ch. 3 n. 71.</p></div><div id="pagenum"><p>Iamblichus makes systematic use ofmathematics in the analysis ofreality. This gives his more complicated system astrong sense ofcontinuity, a continuity on each level ofreality in its articulation in analogy with the numericalprogression (or ﬂow) from monad to decad, and between all levels in the pervasiveness of relations imaged in or</p></div><p id="page">imaging numerical relations. This mathematization ofthe structure ofreality, which seeks at the same time to preservethe distinctions between physics, ethics, mathematics, and metaphysics, represents a systematic application ofthePythagorean principle that ‘all is likened unto number ’. It is thus an important consequence ofIamblichus' programme to Pythagoreanize Neoplatonic philosophy. 2. The Relation of on Pythagoreanismto Iamblichus' Other WorksandInterests In order to assess the signi ﬁcance of On Pythagoreanism it is necessary ﬁrst to determine, as far as possible, its place vis-à- visIamblichus' other philosophical works and the ideas expressed in these works. The problem might be stated in an extreme form by means of the following questions. Is On Pythagoreanism without any importance or relevance with respect to Iamblichus' other work? Did he compose it without any regard to what he himselfconsideredphilosophically signi ﬁcant? Was it perhaps the work ofa beginner (who nevertheless knew a great deal ofphilosophy and could wrestle with Aristotle), to be put aside when, with maturity, different projects were undertaken? 242 Ifthese options are implausible, it is none the less not easy to identif y the place ofOn Pythagoreanism within Iamblichus' philosophical corpus for the simple reason that much of the corpus is lost. Only quotations from, and reports on,Iamblichus' commentaries on Plato and Aristotle survive. The same is true ofother major works, such as theCommentary on the ‘Chaldaean oracles ’.On Mysteries is Iamblichus' only work (not counting individual volumes of On Pythagoreanism ) to be available to us in its entirety. Thus the most that can be attempted is a survey ofindications pointing toward the place of On Pythagoreanism in Iamblichus' philosophy. However, it turns out that there are a good number ofsuch indications and that they are veryRELATION TO IAMBLICHUS' OTHER WORKS 91 242Cf. Dillon (1973), 20. Against Dillon's dismissive attitude to On Pythagoreanism a more direct approach is required than the occasional rapprochements made by Larsen</p><div id="pagenum"><p>(1972) in the course ofhis review ofIamblichus' other works.</p></div><div id="pagenum"><p>strong. They fall into two groups: (i) Iamblichus' own suggestions in On Pythagoreanism as to the relation between it and</p></div><p id="page">certain ofhis other works; and (ii) ref erences to Pythagoreanism in Iamblichus' other work.(i) It has been noted above that On Pythagoreanism does not cover the whole range ofwhat Iamblichus represents as Pythagorean philosophy. It deals with the lower Pythagorean sciences, the four mathematical sciences, preparing theway for, and anticipating, the study of true being and of the divine. But it does not deal with these higher regions ofPythagoreanism in their own right. The work as a whole thus indicates what should follow it: a treatise (or treatises) onbeing and, especially, on the divine. Indeed Iamblichus himselfref ers the reader, in On Pythagoreanism (Pr.120, 15 –18), to his work On God (Πεϱὶθεου ̑), for a more speci ﬁc and technical account ofthe eternal, immaterial, intelligible, unchanging class ofthe gods. This ref erence, with its characteristic distinctions between the common (f amiliar) and thespeciﬁc, between the elementary and the technical, shows that Iamblichus envisages his work On God as a sequel to the mathematical volumes of On Pythagoreanism, dealing at a higher level ofexposition with a higher subject-matter. Not much is known about the work On God. The subject-matter included the class ofintelligible gods: the singular reference of the title should not therefore be taken in a monotheistic sense. The work may perhaps be the same as thetreatise On the Gods (Πεϱὶθεω ̑ν) cited by Iamblichus in On Mysteries, in which he says the reader will ﬁnd a more accurate treatment ofthe cosmic and supra-cosmic gods, ‘which gods lead up and according to which oftheir powers, how they set free from fate and through which hieratic ascents, what sort of order the cosmos has and how the mostperfect intellectual activity rules over it ’(VIII 8, 271, 10 –17). Proclus refers to a work On the Gods by Iamblichus where he says Iamblichus discussed the gods ofthe intellectual order, arguing that the major kinds ofbeing ofPlato's Sophist should be placed at this level and not at that ofthe intelligible order. 243On the Gods thus seems to have dealt with the divine at a variety oflevels, cosmic and supra-cosmic, intellectual, and intelligible. This multi-level approach has beennoticed already in the treatment ofmonad, dyad, and triad in On Pythagoreanism VII. Whether or not On the Gods is the work referred to as On God inOn92 ON PYTHAGOREANISM: GENERAL CONCLUSIONS</p><div id="pagenum"><p>243Theol. Plat. I 52, 2 –13; there is a reference also in Damascius, De princ.

Such, roughly, was the structure ofNicomachus' Theologoumena, and Nicomachus may have in fact used the Pseudo-Pythagoras. 245But ofthe relation (ifany) ofIamblichus' On God (=On the Gods ?) to this work, nothing is known. IfIamblichus' On God was indeed a ‘Pythagorean ’theology, i.e. a treatise on the divine based on Pythagorean literature, then it would have completed, on the basis ofPythagorean sources, the coverage ofPythagorean philosophy begun in On Pythagoreanism. Iamblichus also wrote ‘theologies ’based on Platonic, Egyptian, and Chaldaean sources. His Commentary on Plato's Parmenides interpreted the ﬁrst‘hypothesis ’ofthe Parmenides as concerning god and the gods. 246On Mysteries is yet another theology, derived this time from supposedly Egyptian (but also Chaldaean) sources.247Finally Iamblichus produced an enormous Chaldaean Theology in which the ‘Chaldaean Oracles ’were interpreted with help ofthe Pythagoreans and ofPlato's Philebus.248 It thus turns out that ifone starts f rom the system ofphilosophy presented in On Pythagoreanism, one requires as a sequel a work treating ofbeing and especially ofthe divine. Iamblichus himselfref ers to such a sequel in On Pythagoreanism, namely his ( lost) work On God. It is possible that this work was a ‘Pythagorean ’theology. Iamblichus also produced other theologies, based on Platonic, Egyptian, and Chaldaean sources. These too could complete thecoverage ofPythagorean philosophy begun in On Pythagoreanism, ifone assumption is made, namely that Iamblichus saw, and continued to see, a unity between the theologies ofthe Pythagoreans, ofPlato, ofthe Egyptians, and oftheChaldaeans. In what follows I would like to indicate brie ﬂy the extent to which this assumption can be made.RELATION TO IAMBLICHUS' OTHER WORKS 93 244Vit. Pyth. 81, 20 ff. For this Sacred Discourse cf.

The legend ofPythagoras' apprenticeship under Egyptian priests is repeated: He spent two and twenty years in Egypt in the temples, doing geometry, astronomy, and being initiated, but not in asuperﬁ cial or haphazard way, into all the rites ofthe gods. 249 Pythagoras is reported as having been educated in mathematics and in theology not only by the Egyptians, but also bythe Chaldaeans: Further they say that his divine philosophy and cult was composite, some things being learnt from the Orphics,some from the Egyptian priests, some from the Chaldaean mages, some from Eleusinian rites. . . . 250 Iamblichus does not make clear how Pythagoras' ‘learning ’ofthe main parts ofPythagorean philosophy (mathematics and theology) from the Egyptians and the Chaldaeans can be reconciled with Pythagoras' role as divine revealer of allsciences to man. Nor can reports he reproduces be regarded as re ﬂecting precisely his own views. However, to judge from On Pythagoreanism, it is unlikely that he would have considered Pythagorean theology to be at odds with Egyptian and Chaldaean theology. It is clear at any rate that he identi ﬁed Platonism with Pythagoreanism. On Mysteries stresses the dependence ofPythagoras, Plato, and other Greek philosophers on the Egyptian priests. 251But here Pythagoras appears as a lesser ﬁgure than that found in On Pythagoreanism. His role as a divine guide to the knowledge which can only be mediated to men through divine help is now assumed by Hermes and by Iamblichus'Egyptian priest Abammon: as the ancient Egyptian priests guided and initiated Pythagoras, so will Abammon enlightenthe addressee ofthe work, Porphyry. 252Pythagoras and other Greek philosophers are thus disciples vis-à-vis the Egyptians, not masters. On the other hand, Chaldaean theology is treated as equal to Egyptian94ON PYTHAGOREANISM: GENERAL CONCLUSIONS 249Vit. Pyth. 13, 8–11; cf. 89, 7 –22. 250Vit. Pyth. 85, 14 –18; cf. Comm. 66, 21 –67, 2.

An all-too-briefindication is given ofhow diversity and unity, not only within Egyptian theology, but alsobetween Egyptian and Chaldaean theology could be reconciled: This is true ofall ofthe sciences conveyed to men by the gods. As they advance in time, they are of ten mixed inwith much that is mortal, losing the divine character ( ἠ̑θος) ofthe knowledge. (277, 13 –18) This idea, intended to explain the contradictions Porphyry found in astrology, suggests that the divinely revealedknowledge mediated by Egyptians, Chaldaeans, their pupils Pythagoras, Plato . . . , acquires diversity and even impurity in the course ofits historical tradition.It is not certain that this view ofthe relations between Egyptian, Chaldaean, Pythagorean, and Platonic philosophy isprecisely that presupposed either by On Pythagoreanism or by the Chaldaean Theology. Concerning the latter work, all that can be said on the subject is that Iamblichus thought it suitable to introduce Pythagorean and Platonic ideas in hisinterpretation ofthe ‘Chaldaean Oracles ’. In conclusion, it is safe to say that for the Iamblichus of On Mysteries, a Platonic, Egyptian, or Chaldaean Theology could very suitably be read as a sequel to On Pythagoreanism. It is likely that such would have been his view also in his Chaldaean Theology and in On Pythagoreanism. InOn Pythagoreanism itselfhe ref ers to a sequel, his work On God, which may indeed have been a ‘Pythagorean Theology ’, but not for all that very different from what he there understood to be the theology ofPlato, ofthe Egyptians, and ofthe Chaldaeans.(ii) In the preceding pages I have argued that On Pythagoreanism is related to certain ofIamblichus' other works, taking my cue from indications given in On Pythagoreanism itself: a speci ﬁc reference to a sequel, the work On God ; and the system ofphilosophy presented in On Pythagoreanism as susceptible off ul ﬁlment also by Iamblichus' other theological works. In what follows I shall approach the matter from another angle. The presence of a Pythagoreanizingprogramme in what remains ofIamblichus' other works will be brought out, so as to show that his interest in itextended well beyond the composition ofa work speci ﬁcally devoted to it. I shall discuss what can be learnt inRELATION TO IAMBLICHUS' OTHER WORKS 95</p><div id="pagenum"><p>253De myst. 5, 8–11 (agreement implied); 249, 3 ff. (differences).</p></div><div id="pagenum"><p>particular about Iamblichus' lost commentaries on Plato and Aristotle. It will soon emerge that a tendency toPythagoreanize is a very signi ﬁcant feature of these commentaries. I shall con ﬁne myselfto presenting here some</p></div><p id="page">major aspects, rather than all elements, ofthis large subject. 254It must also be noted that most ofthe available evidence has to do with Iamblichus' commentaries on Aristotle's Categories and on Plato's Timaeus. His other commentaries are, in comparison with these, poorly represented in the reports on Iamblichus to be found in later Neoplatonic authors.Simplicius makes extensive use ofIamblichus' Commentary on the Categories in his own commentary on the Aristotelian text. He also provides a general description ofIamblichus' work: Iamblichus added in various ways to Porphyry'scommentary, often including texts taken from a logical work attributed to the Pythagorean Archytas. Not only didIamblichus believe —incorrectly —the Archytas text to be authentic, but he thought that Aristotle was inspired by the Pythagorean. The harmony ofArchytas and Aristotle was to be shown, re ﬂecting the complete indebtedness of Aristotelian to ‘Archytas ”logic. Where —and it was seldom— Archytas and Aristotle differed, such differences had to be explained. 255Simplicius gives an example ofthis: It seems, Iamblichus says, that the Aristotelian position has been turned away (perverted, παϱατɛτϱάϕθαι) from Pythagorean teaching. The reason is that the moderns do not have the same view ofnumber and ofchange as dothe ancients, but the former think these are accidents, supervening from outside ( ἔξωθɛνἐπɛίσακτα) whereas the latter see them as essential ( οὐσιώδη). 256 This conception ofa perverting among the moderns (Aristotle) ofthe ancient tradition (Pythagoras) f rom which theyderive their knowledge is similar to the idea found above in On Mysteries ofa divine revelation ofknowledge to man which is gradually corrupted with the progress oftime. What it entails here is using ‘Pythagorean ’logic, the (Pseudo-) Archytas, as a standard or guide for the assessment of Aristotle's96ON PYTHAGOREANISM: GENERAL CONCLUSIONS 254Cf. Larsen (1972), chs.

In the case, f or example, ofthe problem oftime, this curious retreat to the supposed sources ofAristotle becomes in fact a means of advancing beyond Aristotle in the direction of a theory a good deal morecomplicated than that found either in Aristotle or in Pseudo-Pythagorean texts. 258 The reconstruction ofBooks V and VI ofOn Pythagoreanism suggests that Iamblichus' attitude there to Aristotelian physics and ethics was similar to his view ofAristotelian logic in his Commentary on the Categories. He could follow Aristotle's physical and ethical treatises, and yet correct them and substitute Pythagorean materials where appropriate,on the assumption that those treatises were fundamentally Pythagorean in inspiration, if sometimes corrupted orperverted in relation to their source. 259 Turning to the evidence concerning Iamblichus' commentaries on Plato, we ﬁnd Pythagoreanism important both in Iamblichus' theories about the Platonic corpus and its exegesis, and in his interpretation ofindividual dialogues. It is awell-established fact that Iamblichus ﬁxed the canon ofPlatonic dialogues which became ‘for more than two centuries the standard curriculum in the Platonic schools ’. 260This canon consisted oftwo cycles, the ﬁrst including ten dialogues dealing successively with ethical, logical, physical, and theological subjects, the second comprising two dialogues, theTimaeus and Parmenides, which sum up the ﬁrst ten dialogues and cover respectively physics and theology. 261This arrangement is hardly arbitrary. Its closest analogue is mathematical: the decad that comprises all numbers, and the ﬁrst two numbers, the monad and dyad, that pre-contain and produce all other numbers. Porphyry, it might be recalled, had also organized Plotinus' treatises in his edition along numerical lines, dividing them into six sets ofnine ( ‘Enneads ’). Theﬁrst dialogue in the ﬁrst cycle, the Alcibiades, was regarded byRELATION TO IAMBLICHUS' OTHER WORKS 97 257In Iamblichus' In cat. Archytas is set up as a ‘guide ’(fr. 106, 2 ἡγɛμόνα πϱοΐσταται), just as Pythagoras is in On Pythagoreanism (Vit. Pyth. 6, 2–3ἡγɛμόνα... πϱοστησ όμɛθα) and Hermes in On Mysteries (1, 6–8ὁτω ̑νλόγωνἡγɛμών...ὁ...πϱοɛστηκώς). 258Cf. above, p. 68. Much could also be said about Iamblichus' use of speci ﬁc Pythagorean principles in the interpretation ofAristotle's Categories ; cf. Iamblichus, In cat. frs. 33, 37, 53, 56, 58. 259Cf.

Plat. xxxvii –xl; Festugière (1969).</p></div><div id="pagenum"><p>Iamblichus as containing implicitly all that would emerge in the following dialogues, i.e. logic, ethics, physics, andtheology. At least, this is Proclus' understanding ofwhy Iamblichus gave the Alcibiades ﬁrst place in the cycle. Proclus</p></div><p id="page">says: And indeed it seems to me that it is for this reason that the divine Iamblichus allotted it the ﬁrst place among the ten dialogues in which he believes the whole philosophy ofPlato to be contained, their entire subsequentdevelopment being pre-contained as it were in seminal form in this dialogue. 262 The metaphor ofa seed as ‘pre-containing ’what will evolve from it is common enough in Neoplatonic philosophy. It should be noted, however, that the subject here is the ﬁrst member ofa series often, i.e. a monad, and that the metaphor ofthe seed appears in Nicomachus and Iamblichus as a way ofdescribing how the monad pre-contains theother numbers ofthe decad that ﬂow out from it. 263This provides further evidence of the mathematical conception underlying Iamblichus' canon ofPlatonic dialogues. For in the ﬁrst cycle ofthis canon Iamblichus compared the relation between the ﬁrst and the following dialogues to the relation between monad and the rest of the decad. One might also note that in terms ofthe system ofphilosophy of On Pythagoreanism there is one important gap in the ascending sequence ofsciences covered by both cycles ofPlatonic dialogues, a gap coming between physics andtheology. Mathematics, namely, is missing, i.e. the pivotal stage covered in On Pythagoreanism. Some ofthe exegetical principles Iamblichus applied in interpreting Plato are regarded by him as Pythagorean. One ofthese consists in explaining the absence ofcertain matters in a text in terms ofthe need to introduce various subjects inappropriate contexts, so that, for example, more profound ideas should be presented in higher, more technicaltreatments. This principle is applied in On Pythagoreanism, as we have seen, and is used by Iamblichus in interpreting Plato's Timaeus : . . . he has allotted deeper investigation ofthese matters to more suitable occasions; f or this was the custom not onlyofPlato but bef ore Plato ofthe Pythagoreans, which indeed was something that Aristotle particularly sought, to deal with the problems ofphilosophy in essays devoted each to a special subject. 26498 ON PYTHAGOREANISM: GENERAL CONCLUSIONS 262Iamblichus, In Alc. fr. 1 (transl.

And these in turn are Orphic principles . . . this Pythagoras himselfstates. 267 A rapprochement between Pythagoras and Orpheus has already been found above in On Pythagoreanism. Iamblichus' approach to Timaeus' discourse also suggests that in his commentary he made use ofPythagorean mathematicalprinciples in the interpretation ofTimaeus' physics, much as he had emphasized mathematical principles in hisPythagoreanizing ofAristotle's physics in On Pythagoreanism V. The evidence indeed shows that Iamblichus referred to the relations between the monad and the numbers ﬂowing from it in explaining the relations in the Timaeus between the ‘Model Living Being ( τὸαὐτοζῳ̑ον)’and other living beings (fr. 43), between transcendent soul and other souls (frs. 50, 54), and between the gods (fr. 77). Nor is it unexpected that when he came to Timaeus' account of the constitution ofsoul through various numbers, Iamblichus drew attention to the special properties ( ἰδιώματα) ofthe numbers concerned, those properties paradigmatic and symbolic ofthe structure and dynamic ofphysical and oftranscendentreality. 268RELATION TO IAMBLICHUS' OTHER WORKS 99 265Iamblichus, In Tim. fr. 5 (transl.

Not enough is known ofIamblichus' commentaries on other works ofAristotle to determine ifsuch anapproach was adopted there too. In discussing Plato's dialogues Iamblichus resorted to Pythagorean ideas (as heunderstood them) to explain his canon ofPlatonic dialogues and to produce exegetical methods to be applied to it. Heregarded the Timaeus as a physics based on Pythagorean principles. And when his reader moved up the scale of dialogues, reaching the highest level, the theological dialogues ( Philebus in the ﬁrst cycle, Parmenides in the second cycle) —equivalent to the highest level ofPythagorean philosophy according to On Pythagoreanism —there too he would read texts which were, ifwe f ollow Iamblichus' interpretation ofPlato in On Pythagoreanism, Pythagorean in inspiration. It has been noted above that Iamblichus explicitly connects On Pythagoreanism with his work On God (Gods?). In view of his understanding ofthe relations between Pythagoreanism, Plato, the Egyptians, and Chaldaeans, On Pythagoreanism is also implicitly connected with his works on Platonic, Egyptian, and Chaldaean theology in so far as they constituteappropriate sequels to it. The general position in On Pythagoreanism regarding the relations between Pythagoras, Plato, and Aristotle is also found in, and governs, his commentaries on (at least some of) the works of Plato and Aristotle.Both Plato and Aristotle owe their philosophy to Pythagoras. When Aristotle diverges, he corrupts the truth in itstradition among men. This latter idea appears in a larger context in On Mysteries, where knowledge is regarded as a divine revelation, mediated by priests, mages, etc., and gradually corrupted with time. From this point ofview theGreek philosophical tradition derived from Pythagoras appears as a relatively recent (thus100ON PYTHAGOREANISM: GENERAL CONCLUSIONS</p><div id="pagenum"><p>269Cf. also Iamblichus, In Philebum (a‘theological ’dialogue) fr. 3, where Iamblichus follows ‘Pythagoras ’in his exegesis ofa passage.

The same theory ofa</p></div><p id="page">divine revelation ofknowledge to man is f ound there, the same recourse to the ancients (in Greek philosophy). Theconnections with Egyptian and Chaldaean teachers are made. But the evidence goes no further. Certainly the historicalthesis of On Mysteries was not con ﬁned to that work. It is f ound again in what survives ofone ofIamblichus' more technical philosophical treatises, On the Soul, where the tradition ofGreek philosophy and especially its best representatives, Plato and the Pythagoreans, are measured (to their disadvantage) against a more venerable authority,the‘ancients ’, meaning apparently the Egyptians and Chaldaeans. 270 3.IamblicheanPythagoreanismandItsPredecessors In the ﬁnal section ofthis chapter I would like to compare Iamblichus' Pythagoreanizing tendencies with those ofhis predecessors, notably the philosophers ofthe second and third centuries ADdiscussed above in Chapter 1. If Iamblichus' Pythagoreanism is to be assessed correctly, it must be viewed not only within the context ofhis otherwork, but also in its relations —ofdebts and ofdif f erence —with its predecessors. Since the fragmentary nature of the evidence concerning most ofIamblichus' work does not permit ofasserting without reserve that his understanding ofthe place ofPythagoras in the history ofGreek philosophy and, more broadly, in the tradition ofknowledge amongmen, remained the same in each ofhis works, 271it will be prudent to consider separately various aspects of Pythagoreanism appearing in his different works.The conception in On Mysteries (also assumed to some degree in On the Soul ) ofGreek philosophy as a relatively modern, somewhat degraded version ofthe teachings ofancient Egyptians and Chaldaeans (themselves divinelyinspired) appears to have been central toIAMBLICHEAN AND HIS PREDECESSORS 101 270Cf. Iamblichus, De an., in Stobaeus, Anth. I 366, 5 –11; 384, 27 –28 (with Festugière's note, [1950 –4], III 236 n. 3); especially 454, 25 –458, 21 (with Festugière's notes, 240–8, 263). More and less accurate (and pure) forms of Platonism/Pythagoreanism are distinguished at 364, 6; 382, 11; 454, 27, corresponding sometimes (not always) toearlier and more recent times: cf. 365, 5 –366, 11. Cf. Larsen's discussion (1972), I 197 ff., of the De an.</p><div id="pagenum"><p>271However, the frequent connections observed above, not only in sect. 2 of this chapter, but also in Ch. 3, suggest considerable continuity.</p></div><div id="pagenum"><p>many ofPorphyry's writings. This was not ofcourse a new idea. As has been pointed out, it was a popular notion sincethe time ofPlato and Aristotle. However, by writing extensively about the Egyptians, Chaldaeans, Persians, as well asabout ancient Greek sages, Porphyry gave to this non-philosophical literature an important place in the reading-lists oflater Greek philosophy. Plato and Aristotle became subordinate ﬁgures, even if, in fact, they provided the system in</p></div><p id="page">terms ofwhich the more ancient literature was understood.IfIamblichus' immediate debt to Porphyry in this respect is evident, his position also seems in some aspects somewhatdifferent. He appears more committed to Porphyry's view than Porphyry himself was. At least, this is the case in regardto Porphyry's Letter to Anebo which, although expecting to ﬁnd the answers to Greek philosophical questions in Egyptian religion, nevertheless formulates philosophical criticisms of certain religious practices. In On Mysteries, however, Iamblichus is quite radical in his insistence that all aspects ofEgyptian religion must be accepted, thoughthrough an interpretation ofthem, it must be said, that is highly philosophical.A comparison ofPorphyry and Iamblichus on this subject also suggests that Iamblichus was more systematic in thesubordination ofGreek philosophy to ancient revelation. This subordination expresses itselfin the conception ofahistorical tradition ofknowledge among men which is also a gradual corruption ofthis knowledge. In view ofPorphyry's historical erudition one can certainly suppose that such a conception may have been inspired by him. Butthe emphasis in Iamblichus on a degradation oftruth coming with its expression in time reminds one rather ofthedegradation that had been traced already by Numenius on a smaller scale in his history ofPlato's Academy.Ifone turns f rom the universal tradition ofknowledge to its expression among the Greeks, one can also observe amore committed and systematic approach in Iamblichus' commentaries on the Categories and on the Timaeus, as well as inOn Pythagoreanism, with regard to the relations between Pythagoras, Plato, and Aristotle. Certainly Porphyry tended</p><div id="pagenum"><p>to Pythagoreanize Platonism and Platonists (Plotinus), and also brought Aristotle into the Neoplatonic curriculum. Butin the evidence concerning him there is no equivalent to Iamblichus' rigorous reduction ofall in Plato and all that hethought good in Aristotle to Pythagoreanism. Such a reduction was greatly facilitated by the availability of supposedlyPythagorean works that Iamblichus took102ON PYTHAGOREANISM: GENERAL CONCLUSIONS</p></div><div id="pagenum"><p>to prove the dependence of Plato and Aristotle on Pythagoreanism, although in fact they were cribbed from Plato andAristotle.</p></div><p id="page">272In this way Pythagoras assumes a dominant role in Greek philosophy such as he does not appear to have in Porphyry. And as the Egyptians and Chaldaeans are original revelatory sources for all mankind, so Pythagoras is forGreek philosophy. Here again, I believe, we must refer to Numenius, to his rigorous reduction of ‘true’,‘pure’ Platonism (as contrasted with its corrupted, i.e. materialized, forms) to Pythagoreanism. However Aristotle, inNumenius, was not, as far as we know, projected backwards on to Pythagoras (and thus integrated) in the way that heis in Iamblichus.When it comes to the description ofwhat actually constitutes ‘Pythagorean philosophy ’, Iamblichus, in On Pythagoreanism, can be said to f ollow the lead ofNicomachus. He adopts Nicomachus' restriction ofPythagorean philosophy to the most ‘scienti ﬁc’form of knowledge, namely that corresponding to immaterial and unchanging reality. He exploits Nicomachus' notion that each number has speci ﬁc properties ( ἰδιώματα) in developing mathematical paradigms for physics and ethics. Such analogies to physics and ethics are also inspired by Nicomachus,as is the justi ﬁcation for the analogy to physics, namely the idea that the material world is structured according to the properties ofnumbers. The assimilations that Nicomachu s proposed between numbers and deities were also taken up (but with some important changes that will be noted below) by Iamblichus. Indeed it can be said that Nicomachus'Introduction to Arithmetic and Theologoumena arithmeticae are the most important source ofinspiration f or On Pythagoreanism as a whole.At the same time, however, there are fundamental differences between Nicomachus and Iamblichus. In general,Iamblichus' view ofthe system ofphilosophy and ofthe structure ofreality is much more complicated, re ﬂecting in f act the thought, not ofa second century Platonist, but ofPorphyry's most important and original pupil. The science ofpure immaterial numbers is by no means the highest, as it appears to be in Nicomachus. Above the purelymathematical level are ‘intellectual ’,‘intelligible ’, and ‘divine ’orders, all transcended by an ultimate principle, ‘the One ’. Mathematics thus is returned from the dominant position it seems to have in Nicomachus to an intermediary positionsuch as is assigned to itIAMBLICHEAN AND HIS PREDECESSORS 103</p><div id="pagenum"><p>272On Iamblichus' unprecedented activity in resurrecting Pseudo-Pythagorica cf. Harder (1926), xv ff.</p></div><div id="pagenum"><p>in Plato's Republic.273As a consequence Iamblichus is aware ofthe limits to an ‘arithmetical theology ’: such a theology is</p></div><p id="page">based on analogy inferior to a higher, more commensurate grasp of the divine unities that transcend being.IfIamblichus is closer to Nicomachus in his mathematical physics and ethics, he also shows considerableindependence. He separates off into separate volumes the analogies to physics, ethics, and theology, which are treatedtogether in Nicomachus' Theologoumena. He develops these analogies far beyond anything in Nicomachus by working them out in relation to Aristotle's physics and ethics. In theology, Iamblichus' approach in On Pythagoreanism VII may have come nearer to Nicomachus', yet the metaphysical system guiding this approach was considerably morecomplicated than that to be found in Nicomachus.The impression ofeclecticism that such comparisons between Iamblichus and his predecessors may convey must becorrected by emphasis on the fact that a comprehensiveness and systematic rigour are found in Iamblichus' conceptionofthe nature ofGreek philosophy that are not f ound in his predecessors. Not only is the reduction, in On Pythagoreanism and in some ofthe commentaries on Plato and Aristotle, ofGreek philosophy to Pythagoreanism more comprehensive than it is in Numenius, more radical than it is in Porphyry, but its subordination, in On Mysteries and On The Soul, to an ancient revelation is more emphatic than in Porphyry. And ifIamblichus is indebted to Nicomachus in his account ofwhat ‘Pythagorean ’philosophy actually consists of, he nevertheless transformed Nicomachus' Pythagoreanism so that it could express the much more developed system ofphilosophy and ofreality ofa successorto Plotinus and to Porphyry. That system was in turn transformed by the fact that it was now seen as ‘Pythagorean ’. For ifmathematics was neither the only nor the dominant science, it nevertheless provided the concepts and theoriesin terms ofwhich the objects ofother sciences could be approached. Mathematical terms and concepts are ofcourseby no means uncommon in the Platonic tradition. But the systematic mathematization which is so striking a feature oflater Greek Neoplatonism, the pervasiveness ofconcepts ofmonad, dyad, triad, etc., is surely the consequence ofIamblichus' ambitious programme to104ON PYTHAGOREANISM: GENERAL CONCLUSIONS 273Cf.Comm. 87, 17 –88, 2, where Iamblichus insists, against the opinion of ‘many ofthe more recent Pythagoreans ’, that mathematicals are neither the only nor the highest</p><div id="pagenum"><p>principles ofreality and ofscience.</p></div><div id="pagenum"><p>Pythagoreanize Platonic philosophy.

I hope thus to reach an answer to the question as to the extent to which this programme, inreducing Plato and Aristotle to Pythagoras and in approaching in consequence the philosophical sciences alongmathematical lines, gave new direction to the development oflater Greek philosophy.Syrianus had, as I shall show, an intimate knowledge ofIamblichus' work On Pythagoreanism : it inspired in particular the conception oftrue, i.e. ‘Pythagorean ’philosophy adopted in his Commentary on Aristotle's Metaphysics. It will be shown also that Proclus was familiar with On Pythagoreanism and used it as a source in his own work. Thus On Pythagoreanism constitutes a concrete link between Iamblichus and the ﬁrst inﬂuential members ofthe Athenian school, a speci ﬁc text in terms ofwhich the degree ofhis in ﬂuence on that school can be assessed in a detailed way. The analysis will be guided by the two major questions discussed in Part I, namely (i) what is the place ofPythagoras inthe history ofGreek philosophy? (ii) What is the role ofmathematics in philosophy? In looking at the positions takenby Syrianus and Proclus on these issues, I hope to indicate not only the ways in which they are inspired by Iamblichus,but also the ways in which they alter the programme formulated in On Pythagoreanism. Iamblichus' treatise will serve thus not only as an historical background for understanding certain ideas in Syrianus and Proclus, but also as a gaugeagainst which the development oftheir own philosophical positions can be measured. 275Cf.

Separated from Iamblichus by more than one generation, Plutarch, we must suppose, was introduced toIamblichean philosophy by f ollowers ofIamblichus. There are indeed good indications that by the end ofthe f ourthcentury Iamblichean philosophy had become part of the intellectual life of Athens. As the evidence for this has alreadybeen carefully presented and discussed, 278I need do no more than summarize the more important points. In the middle and late part ofthe f ourth century a certain Priscus, philosopher and pupil ofAidesius (himselfa discipleofIamblichus), was resident in Athens. It was to him that the Emperor Julian turned in order to obtain a copy ofIamblichus' Commentary on the Chaldaean Oracles. This Iamblichean presence in Athens was strengthened towards the end ofthe century when another Iamblichus settled there. Named af ter the philosopher, he was grandson to Sopatros,Iamblichus' successor in the school in Syria. The relation between ‘Iamblichus II ’and Iamblichus was not merely one ofname and f amily. Libanius places ‘Iamblichus II ’under the tutelage ofPythagoras, Plato, and Aristotle (as well as that ofIamblichus) and he is commemorated as having contributed with his wisdom, as well as with his generosity, toAthens in an inscription of c.400. There was therefore ample opportunity at Athens for Proclus' philosophical ‘grandfather ’to come in contact with Iamblichus' ideas. So little, however, is known about Plutarch that not much more can be said about his contacts withIamblichean philosophy than that he had pupils, namely Hierocles and Syrianus, who adopted this philosophy andattributed this to his direction. 279The scarce evidence concerning110 HIEROCLES 277Cf.

This ﬂies in the face, however, of the professed debts of Plutarch's Iamblichean pupils to their teacher and</p></div><p id="page">argues at best for the inadequacy of our information on Plutarch. 280We are on safer ground, when it comes to the analysis ofspeci ﬁc subjects, ifwe turn to those pupils ofPlutarch whose work has in part at least survived. Among Plutarch's pupils, Hierocles and Syrianus have already been mentioned as well as Proclus, who joined theAthenian school shortly before Plutarch's death. Proclus was certainly younger than Syrianus and probably alsoHierocles' junior. But what little is known ofHierocles' lif e 281—that he studied with Plutarch, to whom he claimed philosophical allegiance, and taught Platonic philosophy in Alexandria —is not enough to determine ifhe was Syrianus' senior, contemporary, or junior. For reasons ofexposition I shall discuss Hierocles ﬁrst, moving then to Syrianus, whose work is more immediately relevant to an examination ofProclus. IfHierocles' writings are contemporary withor later than Syrianus' Commentary on the Metaphysics, they do not constitute the earliest evidence ofthe in ﬂuence of Iamblichean ‘Pythagoreanism ’on the Athenian school. If, however, they are earlier than Syrianus' Commentary they can indeed be claimed as providing the ﬁrst signs ofthis in ﬂuence. These signs may be found in the remarkable theory of the history ofphilosophy presented in Hierocles' work On Providence and in the use made ofPythagoreanism in Hierocles' Commentary on the (pseudo-Pythagorean) Golden Verses. 2.HieroclesontheHistoryofPhilosophy The interest ofHierocles' views on the history ofphilosophy in On Providence has recently been emphasized and their Iamblichean origin demonstrated.282There are some aspects, however, which may beON THE HISTORY OF PHILOSOPHY 111 280Cf. Saffrey and Westerink in Proclus, Theol. Plat. I, lxxxiv –lxxxviii; Blumenthal (1975); I. Hadot (1978), 74. 281Cf. I. Hadot (1978), 17 –20; Aujoulat (1976). 282I.

Baltes (1978 a).</p></div><div id="pagenum"><p>explored further in the light of what has emerged in Part I concerning Iamblichus' treatise On Pythagoreanism.</p></div><p id="page">Hierocles' work On Providence survives in the form of a two-part précisgiven by the Patriarch Photius in his Bibliotheca (cod.214, 251). Photius emphasizes in his account Hierocles' desire to show a harmony between the views ofPlato and Aristotle on the subjects of providence, fate, and free will. That the impression conveyed by Photius here is unbalancedcan be seen from his own indications about the contents of On Providence (cod.214, 173 a), according to which the discussion ofAristotle was a subordinate part ofa much larger scheme. 283Only after having presented and defended Plato's views and having shown their harmony with the ‘Chaldaean Oracles ’, Orpheus, Homer, ‘and all those others who distinguished themselves before Plato's epiphany ( ἐπιϕάνɛια)’, does Hierocles come to a survey ofAristotle's views. Certain thinkers, through contentiousness or ignorance, we are told, attempted to introduce disharmonybetween the views ofAristotle and Plato, but the harmony was restored by Plotinus' teacher Ammonius Saccas, whopuriﬁed philosophy and whose lead was followed by a continuous succession of philosophers going from Plotinus through Porphyry and Iamblichus to Hierocles' master, Plutarch ofAthens. 284 If we compare this account with the history of philosophy as understood by Iamblichus, the following differencesmight be noted. Even ifallowance is made f or the undue emphasis Photius gives to the theme ofthe harmony betweenPlato and Aristotle, it appears that Hierocles' treatment ofthis theme diverges f rom that in Iamblichus. Hierocles doesnot seem to agree with the Iamblichean view that Aristotle was sometimes right (when he was faithful toPythagorean –Platonic philosophy) and sometimes wrong (when he perverted the truth, primarily as regards transcendent being). Hierocles believes rather that later thinkers falsi ﬁed Plato's and Aristotle's works so as to bring Aristotle into disagreement with Plato. 285Hierocles therefore shifts the blame for Aristotle's differences with Plato from Aristotle himselfto later thinkers. The theory off alsi ﬁcation (which we have already met above (p. 11) in connection with the protest that some attempted to discredit Pythagoreanism by falsifying ‘Pythagorean ’writings) implies a more positive view ofAristotle than that taken by Iamblichus. Yet the112HIEROCLES 283The point is made by Elter (1910), 180 –3, 198. 284Photius, Bibl. III 125– 30, 171 b –173 a, with I. Hadot, loc. cit.</p><div id="pagenum"><p>285Photius, Bibl. VII 191, 461 a.</p></div><div id="pagenum"><p>kindof harmony that Hierocles seeks to promote is not essentially different than that assumed by Iamblichus: if</p></div><p id="page">Aristotle is brought into agreement with Plato, it is ofcourse on Platonic terms.286 The role given to Plotinus' teacher Ammonius is another novel element in Hierocles' account. Ammonius emerges ashaving accomplished what had been essentially Numenius' mission: the restoral ofunanimity ( ὁμοδοξ ία) to Platonism through the puri ﬁcation ofa contentious and degraded tradition. 287It looks as ifa direct rebuttal ofNumenius' pretensions is intended; his mission is taken over and, in being attributed to Ammonius, is placed ﬁrmly in the tradition going from Plotinus, through Porphyry and Iamblichus, to Plutarch. There is no trace of this to be found in whatsurvives ofIamblichus' work, but his hostility (and debt) to Numenius would certainly have disposed him to take sucha position. However, another source has been proposed both for this treatment of Ammonius and for the theme ofthe harmony between Plato and Aristotle: Porphyry. 288 Whatever the origin ofthese novel aspects in Hierocles, it is clear that he (or his immediate source) made them part ofa broader conspectus ofthe history ofphilosophy that recalls most ofall Iamblichus' views. 289The rigorous reduction ofall Greek philosophy to one true philosophy (Platonism) and the perversions thereofis Iamblichean in spirit, as isthe insistence on a systematic harmonization ofPlatonism with ancient Greek and barbarian wisdom (such as the‘Chaldaean Oracles ’). Furthermore Hierocles' interpretation oftrue philosophy as a revelation is also that of Iamblichus: Plato intervenes in human history as an ‘epiphany ’, and Ammonius, the puri ﬁer ofphilosophy, is instructed by the divine ( θɛοδίδακτος ). 290Is this revelation to be understood, as it is in Iamblichus, as a soteriological mission undertaken by certain superior souls who are interpreted as members ofthe divine retinue, or ‘choir ’,o f Plato's Phaedrus ? Photius' précisis oflittle help here, although he does give some indications that this was indeed Hierocles' view.291However, the Commentary on the Golden Verses makes it very clear, as will be seen shortly, that Hierocles' understanding ofthe revelatory nature ofphilosophy was Iamblichean.ON THE HISTORY OF PHILOSOPHY 113 286Cf. also below, pp. 120– 4 (on Syrianus' harmonization ofPlato and Aristotle). 287Cf. also Photius, Bibl.

One might infer from Photius' silence that Pythagoras was at most of secondary importance to Hierocles.It could also be argued that Pythagoras is the victim ofa serious omission in Photius' summary, surviving only in therushed and generalized allusion in the phrase (quoted above): ‘and all those others who distinguished themselves before Plato's epiphany ’. Certainly Hierocles' only surviving work, the Commentary on the Golden Verses, argues strongly for the importance of Pythagoras, and the evidence of the Commentary is weightier than what conjectural inferences may be drawn from the Patriarch's report. 3.PythagoreanisminHierocles'CommentaryontheGoldenVerses The Pythagorean Golden Verses are used by Iamblichus in the introductory part of On Pythagoreanism (Protrepticus, ch. 3). Still available also are Arabic versions oftwo commentaries on the Golden Verses, one attributed to Iamblichus, the other to Proclus. Although there are good reasons for supposing that the Arabic texts derive from Greek Neoplatonicoriginals, the attributions to Iamblichus and Proclus present some problems. I propose therefore to discuss the Arabictexts in Appendix II below, treating them as providing further indications of Pythagoreanizing tendencies inNeoplatonic philosophy rather than as documents on the basis ofwhich the history ofsuch tendencies may bedeveloped. At any rate the two Arabic texts, like Iamblichus' On Pythagoreanism, use the Golden Verses as an introductory work, providing the beginner with a primarily ethical initiation to philosophy. The fullest extant version of such a use oftheGolden Verses, however, is Hierocles' Commentary. Hierocles makes his intentions very clear in the prologue ofhis Commentary. The Golden Verses, he claims, contain the general and basic principles ofall philosophy: they put the beginner in philosophy on the road to his goal, assimilationto god, through the cultivation ofvirtue and truth; this they achieve in so f ar as they provide the rules and starting-points necessary for moving towards the goal (5, 1 –6, 2). Such is the work to which Hierocles will put the Golden Verses in his Commentary. The Commentary is thus intended to provide an elementary initiation to philosophy based on</p><div id="pagenum"><p>Pythagorean principles and114HIEROCLES</p></div><div id="pagenum"><p>aiming beyond itselftowards a Pythagorean goal (cf . 7, 17 –18), assimilation to god.292The Commentary is pitched</p></div><p id="page">therefore at the same level and has the same purpose as the ﬁrst two books ofIamblichus' On Pythagoreanism. Mixing Pythagorean doctrines with moral platitudes drawn from other sources, the Commentary also exhibits the eclectic approach characteristic ofIamblichus' ‘Pythagorean ’introduction to philosophy. More detailed comparisons will be made between Hierocles and Iamblichus below in the course ofreviewing some speci ﬁc aspects ofHierocles' approach in his Commentary.293 As compared to the impression that is conveyed by Photius' summary of On Providence, the prologue ofthe Commentary shows that Hierocles here sees Pythagoreanism as embracing the basic truths ofall philosophy, including byimplication that ofPlato. The relation between Plato and Pythagoras is made explicit later in the Commentary (111, 13–14), where Plato appears as the interpreter in the Phaedrus (246 a) ofPythagorean doctrine and where Plato's personage Timaeus (cf. Tim.44 c 1) is described as an ‘accurate teacher ofPythagorean doctrines ’(6, 1–2; cf. 53, 1). Empedocles is also characterized as a Pythagorean, as he had been by Iamblichus. 294 If then Platonism (indeed all true philosophy) is for Hierocles, as well as for Iamblichus, to be found already inPythagoreanism, this philosophy is itselfto be seen as divine revelation. Traces ofthis idea have been noted above asoccurring in Photius' summaries. The Commentary on the Golden Verses is much more informative on the matter and conﬁrms that Hierocles understood this revelatory aspect ofphilosophy, as did Iamblichus, in connection with an interpretation ofPlato's Phaedrus. In ch. 4 ofthe Commentary Hierocles explains the Pythagorean notion of ‘demonic ’ men: these are men excelling in virtue and wisdom who are ‘demonic ’because of their freedom from subjection to the body. Such men are to be honoured, for they ‘rank’(συντɛταγμένους, 21, 21) with divine beings and are carried around with the divine choir ( τῳ̑θɛίῳχοϱῳ̑συμϕɛϱόμɛνος, 22, 1). The connection between this imagery, taken from the Phaedrus, and the origins ofphilosophy emerges in the f ollowing lines. These demonicCOMMENTARY ON THE GOLDEN VERSES 115 292Cf. also I.

The</p></div><p id="page">Golden Verses are obviously one ofthose writings and are described later (122, 1 –5) as an ‘educational introduction ’ (παιδɛυτικὴστοιχ ɛίωσις) left to us and written by men who had already ‘ascended the divine way ’. It does not seem that theGolden Verses are the only source of philosophical wisdom conferred on us for our bene ﬁt by those men ofsuperior insight, those participants in the vision ofthe Phaedrus. And it is likely that their company includes, not only Pythagoras, but also Plato. 295 Hierocles' notion that the Golden Verses and other ‘Pythagorean ’writings are commands or exhortations (παϱαγγέλματα), containing basic rules and starting-points in philosophy ( κανόνɛς,ἀϕοϱμαί) conferred on men for their edi ﬁcation by superior souls, is an important theme in the ﬁrst two books ofIamblichus' On Pythagoreanism. Pythagoras is represented in the ﬁrst book as instructing his followers with exhortations ( παϱαγγέλματα) concerning friendship ( Vita Pyth. 123, 27 ff.). Ch. 3 of the following book, the Protrepticus, is devoted to the exegesis ofmoral aphorisms (γνώμαι) contained in the Golden Verses, and excerpts from Plato are presented in ch. 5 as Pythagorean moral exhortations ( παϱακλήσɛις). However there are signi ﬁcant differences between the exegesis of the Golden Verses in Iamblichus' Protrepticus ch. 3 and that in Hierocles' Commentary. Iamblichus' chapter on the Golden Verses296is a small portion ofa survey that includes a very wide range ofsupposedly Pythagorean and admittedly non-Pythagoreanmaterials. Hence he includes only a selection from the Golden Verses, and interpretation is kept to a bare moralizing minimum. On the other hand Hierocles' use ofthe Golden Verses as the text ofhis Commentary is more extensive and his exegesis much more developed. 297These differences may help explain why Hierocles does not seem to have used Protrepticus ch. 3 as a source for his exegesis, despite verbal parallels and similarities in the general tendency of interpretation.298Ifindeed Hierocles is dependent on a source —and116 HIEROCLES 295If40, 15 –17 ( ‘divine men ’) alludes to the Phaedo and/or Phaedrus.

Pyth. 81, 3 ff. 297At 87, 19 –20 Hierocles also cites the Sacred Discourse attributed to Pythagoras and, at 114, 14 ff., the Pythagorean σύμβολα explained by Iamblichus in Pr.123, 3 ff. Cf.

He also shares their view as to the role ofmathematics in this ﬂight: mathematics acts as an intermediary, purifying the soul for the higher vision (116, 20 –7). As is appropriate for the level and approach ofhis work, he does not introduce much in the way ofmathematical theory. However when the exegesisofthe Golden Verses involves explaining the Pythagorean concept ofthe ‘tetractys ’(87, 17 ff.), Hierocles embarks on a numerological disquisition on the mathematical and extra-mathematical characteristics ( ἱδιώματα) ofthe tetrad such as can be found in Nicomachus, Anatolius, and other numerological sources. 301Before doing this, however, Hierocles refers to the Sacred Discourse attributed to Pythagoras which he reports as praising the demiurge god as the ‘number of numbers ’(87, 20 –1). A briefinterpretation is provided: since the demiurge god made all things, The number in the form of each thing is dependent on the cause in him, and the ﬁrst number is there [ἐ κει ̑,i . e .i n god], for it is from there that number comes here. (87, 21 –5) The passage is too briefto allow us to conclude, f or example, that the Iamblichean idea of ‘physical number ’is implied. But it could well be considered as yielding a briefglimpse into the sort ofinterpretation Iamblichus might haveprovided for the Sacred Discourse. Mathematics is not the only intermediary for Hierocles in the ascent to god. ‘Hieratic ’puriﬁcations are required by the ‘pneumatic vehicle ’ofthe soul (116, 27 –117, 4). The reference, it has been noted, is to the ‘Chaldaean Oracles ’, which are quoted earlier in the same connection. 302Thus not only does Hierocles appropriate Plato for Pythagoreanism, in this sense ‘harmonizing ’them (σύμϕωνος,9 8 ,COMMENTARY ON THE GOLDEN VERSES 117 299Cf. I. Hadot (1978), 71, 93 –7, 99 –106, 107 –110, 112 –13. 300Jerome ( Ep. adv. Ruf. 108, ch. 39, 29 –31) refers to an otherwise unknown Commentary on the Golden Verses by Iamblichus: could this be Hierocles' source?

All that is missing for this Iamblichean view of</p></div><p id="page">philosophy to be complete is Orpheus, yet he also is present, implicitly, as the alleged revelatory source ofthePythagorean Sacred Discourse. 303 4.Conclusion Hierocles' theories about providence and free will, about the structure of reality and man's relation to it, deserve andhave received separate treatment. 304It has been the purpose ofthis chapter to show that Hierocles' attitude to the nature and history ofphilosophy can be related at many points to Iamblichus' views and in particular to hisinterpretation of Pythagorean philosophy. There appear to be some differences on the subject of Aristotle and(possibly) ofAmmonius. There is also the contrast between the absence ofPythagoras in Photius' précisofOn Providence and the centrality ofPythagoreanism f or philosophy in the Commentary on the Golden Verses. Yet we may here be the victim ofPhotius' procedures. Detailed doctrinal comparisons between the reports on On Providence and the Commentary do not suggest that Hierocles held divergent theories in these works. 305Both works presuppose an Iamblichean mixing ofPlatonic (or Pythagorean) philosophy with barbarian revelation. For both works philosophy is itselfa revelationwhich, as Photius' report seems to suggest and as the Commentary explains, is communicated to man for his bene ﬁtb y souls less emprisoned by the body and privy to the transcendent vision ofPlato's Phaedrus. The Commentary corresponds in fact in many respects —in intention, level, approach —to the ﬁrst books ofIamblichus' On Pythagoreanism. Ifthe Commentary, however, does not depend on On Pythagoreanism as its immediate source, it remains that Iamblichean Pythagoreanism provides a context for explaining why a Neoplatonic teacher of the late fourth/earlyﬁfth century would choose, as a way of initiating beginners to philosophy, to comment on the Pythagorean Golden Verses. And, as noted above, Hierocles' position on the nature and history ofphilosophy in his Commentary represents the essential points ofIamblichus' Pythagoreanizing programme.118HIEROCLES 303Cf. above, Ch. 4 n. 13. 304Kobusch (1976); I.

A more signi ﬁcant and interesting case is provided by the extant works ofSyrianus, pupil with Hierocles ofPlutarch, successor to Plutarch at Athens in 431/2, and much-admired teacher ofProclus. Threeworks ofSyrianus survive: his Commentary on Hermogenes (a textbook on rhetoric), his Commentary on Aristotle's Metaphysics, and his lectures on Plato's Phaedrus as preserved in Hermias' Commentary on the Phaedrus. I shall discuss the second and third ofthese works. Despite his importance f or Proclus, Syrianus has not on the whole received muchattention. 306Certain preliminary but basic problems concerning his work will therefore require clari ﬁcation, at least to the extent that they have bearing on the ‘Pythagoreanism ’ofSyrianus. 1.TheHistoryofPhilosophyinSyrianus From a philosophical point ofview Syrianus' Commentary on Aristotle's Metaphysics is doubtless his most promising extant work. Yet the basic intentions and assumptions ofthe Commentary have never been established. Syrianus seems to have so little to say about Aristotle's master-work, adding so much that seems irrelevant, that his Commentary has largely been ignored.307As a consequence such a preliminary question as that concerning the incomplete state ofthe Commentary has scarcely been addressed. Yet an answer to this question is required ifa better 306Sheppard has published recently (1980, 1982) detailed and useful studies. However Praechter (1932) remains the best overall survey. Cf. also Saffre y and Westerink, in Proclus, Theol. Plat. III xl –li; IV xxix –xxxvii. 307Recent exceptions are Sheppard (1982), Verbeke (1981), Madigan (1986); all take Syrianus' Commentary seriously. Kremer (1961) has little to say speci ﬁcally about</p><div id="pagenum"><p>Syrianus.</p></div><div id="pagenum"><p>understanding ofSyrianus' intentions in the Commentary is to be reached.</p></div><p id="page">Why does Syrianus' Commentary, as we now have it, cover only Books B,Γ,M ,and NofAristotle's Metaphysics ?D ow e possess only the remains ofwhat was once a much larger commentary spanning the complete text ofthe Metaphysics ? Or did Syrianus choose to comment only on Books BΓMNand, ifso, why? The problem has not been examined since it was discussed brie ﬂy by Praechter in a footnote in 1903.308In what follows the relevant internal and external evidence will be considered.At the beginning ofthe extant Commentary Syrianus summarizes the contents of Metaphysics A andα, but not in such a way as to indicate that he himselfhad commented on these books. Book Ais mentioned again at 195, 11– 13: f ollowing the Aristotelian commentator Alexander ofAphrodisias, Syrianus notes that Aristotle's criticism ofPlato andthe Pythagoreans in Books MNoccurs already in Book A.Syrianus' reference suggests that he did not comment on Book A.The bulk ofthe extant Commentary deals with Metaphysics M and N(treated as one), i.e. with Aristotle's massive polemic with Platonism and Pythagoreanism: Syrianus attempts in his Commentary to rebuff Aristotle's criticisms, point by point. In Metaphysics B Aristotle formulated a series of puzzles or questions relevant to the science of metaphysics (‘ﬁrst philosophy ’or‘theology ’as he calls this science). For each puzzle Syrianus' Commentary provides the reader with the right (!), i.e. Platonic –Pythagorean, answer (cf. 1, 20 –2, 3). Finally Aristotle's unpolemical and general characterization ofmetaphysics in Book Γappears to have been acceptable to Syrianus, since he contents himselfwith a paraphrase (expanded at some points), referring the reader to Alexander ofAphrodisias' commentary on the book (cf. 54, 11 –15). The surviving books ofSyrianus' Commentary therefore give the general impression that for some parts ofAristotle's Metaphysics Alexander's Aristotelian commentary could serve, but for those parts where the issues were unclear and (especially) where Aristotle attacked Platonism –Pythagoreanism a detailed commentary was required. In other words, for a Platonist, a complete new commentary on Aristotle's Metaphysics is not needed: for parts of the work Alexander's commentary suf ﬁces. The general impression given by the surviving books ofSyrianus' Commentary corresponds exactly to Syrianus' valuation ofAristotle in120SYRIANUS</p><div id="pagenum"><p>308Praechter (1903), 260 n. 1.</p></div><div id="pagenum"><p>the important prologue to his commentary on Books MN(80, 4 ff.). Like Iamblichus, Syrianus accepts —indeed</p></div><p id="page">admires —Aristotle's teaching on logic, ethics, and physics (80, 5 –7). He is grateful also for all that Aristotle shows concerning divine unchanging transcendent realities in the Metaphysics. In all this Aristotle is truly a benefactor (ɛὐɛϱγέτης) ofmankind (80, 10 –16). However in attacking Platonism and Pythagoreanism in some parts ofthe Metaphysics (especially in Books MN), Aristotle is gravely misled and misleading. Such attacks, Syrianus believes, must be shown to be worthless in order that simpler pupils may not be led astray and come to despise divine realities anddivine science. 309Syrianus' attitude to Aristotle therefore calls for the sort of commentary on the Metaphysics that has in fact survived: a partial commentary including in particular the supplements and correctives required to turn Aristotle'swork into an acceptable treatise on Platonic metaphysics, the science oftrue and divine beings. 310 Ifthe internal evidence suggests that Syrianus' Commentary need not have covered all parts ofAristotle's Metaphysics, there is some external evidence that tends to show that the Commentary may have been somewhat more extensive than it is in its present form. Proclus had a pupil Ammonius who taught in Alexandria and whose lectures on the Metaphysics were recorded by a student, Asclepius.311In the Commentary on the Metaphysics ofAsclepius, Syrianus is cited twice. Neither for the ﬁrst reference in Asclepius (433, 9 –14) nor for the second (450, 22 –5) can satisfactory parallels be found in the extant books of Syrianus' Commentary.312In fact this is what one would expect, since both of Asclepius' references record Syrianus' interpretation of speciﬁcpassages of Metaphysics Z. Asclepius, one must conclude, seems to have been acquainted in some way with the particulars ofSyrianus' exegesis of(at least) parts of Metaphysics Z. What is more, the ﬁrst reference in Asclepius concerns Syrianus' defence of Plato against Aristotle's criticisms in Metaphysics Z 13—precisely the kind oftext that would require Syrianus' intervention.313In commenting onHISTORY OF PHILOSOPHY 121 30980, 16 –29; Saffrey (1987 b) translates and discusses this passage. 310Verbeke (1981) shows the Platonic character ofSyrianus' understanding ofmetaphysics; cf . also O'Meara (1986). 311On Ammonius and Asclepius, cf. Tarán (1969), 8; Richard (1950), 192 –3; Kremer (1961). 312Praechter refers (loc. cit.) for the ﬁrst citation to Syrianus, In met. 12, 33 ff., for the second to Syrianus 17, 20 (cf. also 82, 2 –11; but 10, 37 –11, 1 contradicts Asclepius' report). 313Cf. also Asclepius, In met. 418, 15 –18: Pythagoreanism defended against Aristotle; Syrianus is not named, but the defence is very much in his manner. Cf. I. Hadot (1987 b),</p><div id="pagenum"><p>4.</p></div><div id="pagenum"><p>Metaphysics A (ch. 9), Asclepius had already rejected Aristotle's critique of Plato (75, 19 ff.) on essentially the same</p></div><p id="page">grounds as those that had been used in another, but similar, context by Syrianus (111, 12 ff., on Met. M 4): Aristotle's ‘third man ’argument illegitimately assumes a similarity (Asclepius) or synonymity (Syrianus) between Forms and sensible objets; Forms ofrelations are not absurd, as Aristotle suggests, in those cases (such as physiological andcosmic organization) where relations are ofthe essence ( οὐσιώδης) ofthings. Asclepius (Ammonius) may be dependent here on Syrianus or possibly on an ultimate common source, namely Iamblichus, to whom he refers shortlyafterwards. 314Ifthe relation between the commentaries ofSyrianus and Asclepius remains to be determined,315it can at least be concluded here that there are indications in Asclepius that Syrianus commented on portions of Metaphysics Z and possibly of A.But here again Syrianus took the line that is implied in the extant books ofhis Commentary, namely rectiﬁcation ofAristotle's Metaphysics at those points where it diverges from Platonism and Pythagoreanism. In correcting the aberrations in Aristotle's Metaphysics Syrianus believed he was reconciling it with the ‘ancient ’,‘true’, and‘best’ofphilosophies on which Aristotle himselfwas dependent, the philosophy ofPythagoras (81, 9 –11 and 25–31). Aristotle, we are told, owed his book On Generation and Corruption to the ‘Pythagorean ’Ocellus; his physics in general to Plato's Pythagorean, Timaeus; his Categories to Archytas.316Yet Aristotle sometimes seceded from the ancient philosophy, particularly in the Metaphysics (In met. 10, 37), introducing disharmony ( τὸδιάϕωνον) through attempting, it seems, to combine philosophic insight with the received opinions of ‘the many ’(60, 27 –30). Pythagoras had more faithful adherents, ‘Pythagoreans ’who had received the doctrines ofthe ‘divine ’Pythagoras in the ‘pure bosom oftheir thought ’, Parmenides, Empedocles, and especially Plato.317To122 SYRIANUS 31477, 9. However, it is not clear that Iamblichus wrote a Commentary on the Metaphysics ; cf. above, Ch. 3, n. 65. 315Cf. Praechter (1903), 260 –3 (inconclusive); Asclepius at some points differs from Syrianus: he sometimes accepts Aristotle's distinction between Pythagoreans and Plato and tends to regard Aristotle as attacking certain Platonists rather than Plato himself (cf. Praechter, 259); this must be Ammonius' approach, from whom Asclepiuspresumably has what he knows about Iamblichus and Syrianus; cf. Madigan (1986). 316175, 8 –11; 192, 16 –21; cf. In Hermog.

Pythagorean philosophy is linked up in turn with the ancient ‘theologians ’, Orpheus, the ‘Chaldaean Oracles ’, and Homer.318Indeed Syrianus wrote a ten-volume work (since lost) on‘the harmony ( συμϕωνία) ofOrpheus, Pythagoras, and Plato with the 〈Chaldaean 〉Oracles ’, and this is presumably the approach taken in the other works (also lost) he devoted to Homer.319 In dissenting from Pythagoreanism Aristotle cut himself off from the truth. The difference between Aristotle and thetrue Pythagoreans is also expressed in Syrianus as a distinction between their ‘divine ’and his (merely!) ‘demonic ’ nature. 320Should this distinction be understood in the light ofPlato's Phaedrus and its depiction ofsouls joined to a divine vision and souls fallen from this vision? An extraordinary passage in Syrianus' Commentary on the Metaphysics points in this direction: Those divine men 〈the Pythagoreans, Plato 〉say that god is ‘one’as the cause ofunity f or all . . . whereas this demonic man 〈Aristotle〉, taking the smallest quantity and that which through smallness appears the common measure ofhomogeneous things, insists that there is no measure, nor ‘one’, that is not found in a substrate. And it is obvious how from the ﬁrst cause of beings, or from its cognate monad, the account falls ( καταπ ɛσὼνὁλόγος)... slipping from the incorporeal realm of substances and from the encosmic level, and, brought down to the lowestdegree ofcorporeal things, is thrown upside down, 321busying itselfwith the smallest . . . ofmasses.322 Elsewhere in the Commentary Syrianus does not fail to link decline and fall in philosophical insight with the myth of thePhaedrus (82, 15 –20; 83, 7 –11; 106, 3 –5).

Philosophy as Revelation in Hermias' Commentary on thePhaedrus It is generally agreed that Hermias' Commentary on the Phaedrus consists ofnotes based on the lectures (that he attended in company with Proclus) ofSyrianus on the Phaedrus. Hermias reports, for example, a puzzle put by ‘my confrère Proclus ’and‘the Master's ’response, and there are traces elsewhere in the Commentary ofclassroom discussion.323It has also been suggested that Hermias added to his notes material he took from Iamblichus' Commentary on the Phaedrus.324If this were the case, we would not be justi ﬁed in using Hermias simply as evidence for Syrianus' views. The theory that Hermias supplemented Syrianus' lectures with Iamblichean material is based on the diversity andsometimes apparently contradictory tendencies ofthe exegeses that Hermias provides f or particular passages in Plato.However the diversity and apparent disagreement in exegeses in some instances have to do with the fact that theyrepresent different kindsofinterpretation, and are thus quite compatible in a Neoplatonic view ofthings. 325And it is possible that disagreeing interpretations might have been presented, as alternatives, by Syrianus himself.326 A method for testing the theory that Hermias' Commentary is a composite ofIamblichus and Syrianus would consist in examining the ways in which Hermias cites Iamblichus. Is he cited at ﬁrst hand, as additional material, or is he reported as an integral part ofa lecture? Most ofHermias' ref erences to Iamblichus are simple doxographical124SYRIANUS 32392, 6 ff.; 154, 19 –23 and 28 –30; cf. Praechter (1913), 733; Bielmeier (1930), 31 –2; Saffrey and Westerink in Proclus, Theol. Plat. IV xxxi-xxxii. 324Bielmeier (1930), 33 –5; his position, to which he does not commit himself, has not generally been accepted; cf. Sheppard (1980), 20 n. 8. 325Cf. Praechter (1932), 1744. Thus the interpretations of Phaedrus 229 b in Hermias 28, 13 ff. and 29, 11 ff., represent ethical, theological, and anagogical exegeses. For different kinds of interpretation cf. Hermias, 15, 13 ff.; 54, 19 ff. The exegeses at 39, 10 –23, are perfectly compatible. 326Cf. 215, 9 ff.: Iamblichus' interpretation is ‘cited’, perhaps by Syrianus himself. There is no contradiction between the exegeses at 145, 2 ff. and 10 ff.: they have to do with</p><div id="pagenum"><p>different Platonic texts.</p></div><div id="pagenum"><p>reports that read more like parts ofa post-Iamblichean exegesis than as supplements copied directly f romIamblichus.</p></div><p id="page">327One text is particularly revealing: the opinion ofthe ‘divine ’Iamblichus is contrasted with ‘our’ interpretation which follows more closely Plato and the ‘theologians ’(136, 17– 26): Syrianus, it seems, is speaking, noting Iamblichus' position and taking the liberty ofdisagreeing. In another passage (150, 24 –151, 3), Hermias reports a defence of Iamblichus' position against an objection; the defender of Iamblichus in all likelihood is Syrianus. Iconclude therefore that Hermias' way of referring to Iamblichus does not support the idea that heinserted Iamblichean materials in Syrianus' lecture notes. 328It seems rather that in the course ofexplaining the Phaedrus Syrianus took account ofIamblichus' views, def ended them when appropriate and even at times disagreed. At any rate the grounds againstreading Hermias' Commentary as based simply on Syrianus' lectures are inadequate. But what then ofSyrianus' views, as reported by Hermias, on the relation between philosophy, its history, and thePhaedrus ? The two actors ofPlato's dialogue, Socrates and Phaedrus, embody the answer. The Phaedrus exempli ﬁes the mission ofa superior soul sent down to save f allen souls, to recall them through philosophy to higher realities: Socrates has been sent down ( κατɛπέμϕθη) to the world ofbecoming to bene ﬁt(ἐπὶɛὐɛϱγɛσίᾳ) mankind and the souls of the young. Since souls differ greatly in character and practices, he bene ﬁts each in a different way, the young, the sophists . . . turning them to philosophy. (1, 1 –5) Socrates thus provides a protreptic to philosophy tailored to the particular character and needs ofthe soul to be saved,in this case Phaedrus'. This practice ofworking on each soul in an appropriate way is connected later (259, 19 –23) with the‘Pythagoreans ’. But what is of more immediate concern here is the difference between the soul of Socrates and that of Phaedrus that accounts for Socrates' particular soteriological function.Socrates is referred to as a ‘saviour ’ 329who seeks to bring back souls who have fallen from the divine company of the gods (τη ̑ςσυμπ ɛϱιπολήσɛωςτω ̑νθε ̑ν), who have narrowed and particularized themselves in the world ofbecoming, cutting themselves off from the worldHERMIAS' COMMENTARY ON THE PHAEDRUS 125 327Cf. 9, 10 (which Bielmeier, 31, regards as part of an ‘Unterrichtseinheit ’); 68, 26; 200, 29; note especially the language at 113, 25 and 215, 12 ff. 328The quotation at 143, 24, is too briefto prove the contrary.</p><div id="pagenum"><p>329Cf. 54, 31 –3; 33, 2; 64, 30 –65, 1; on the idealized portrait ofSocrates in general cf . Bielmeier (1930), 62 –5.</p></div><div id="pagenum"><p>above (63, 18– 23). Socrates is ‘sent down ’—he has not ‘fallen ’—and preserves intact his close relation to the divine</p></div><p id="page">vision ofthe gods ofthe Phaedrus.330He is in fact the agent and instrument of a god, Eros, who is therefore the primary saviour ofsouls (8, 8 –9; 48, 16 –17). It is from Eros that Socrates receives his erotic, i.e. anagogic, power (5, 28 –6, 2). Socrates is such a key ﬁgure in this interpretation ofthe Phaedrus that Hermias' Commentary is chie ﬂy concerned with him. His relation to other philosophers remains somewhat in the background. However his ‘Pythagorean ’practice of adapting his instruction to the character ofhis audience has already been noted. He is also said to share Pythagoras'attitude to writing (210, 21 –2; 258, 10) and at one point is interpreted as referring to the Pythagoreans as wiser than he (252, 7). Indeed Socrates, according to Hermias, was in the habit ofgiving credit f or his work to the gods and to thosemen who are ‘companions ofthe gods ’(ὀπαδοὺςθεω ̑νἄνδϱας): And indeed he thought it right to call the divine men gods in the Sophist, for the wise and divine men are as gods in relation to men. And so he was wont often to credit his works to the divine men, in the Phaedrus to Pythagoras, in theCharmides to Zalmoxis, a wise man, and the story ofAtlantis in the Timaeus to the Egyptians. 331 Socrates is therefore a member —in his own eyes a subordinate member —ofa company of‘divine ’men, participants with him in the divine vision ofthe Phaedrus, a company including Pythagoras and, we may assume, Plato. As for Aristotle, he is used in Hermias in a way matching in its practice Syrianus' judgement ofAristotle in the Commentary on the Metaphysics : Hermias resorts to Aristotle especially when it comes to dealing with problems in logic and physics and when syllogistic formulation for Plato's text is desired.332On the movement ofthe soul there is no disagreement ( οὐδὲ διαφωνου ̑σιν), it is claimed, between Aristotle and Plato (104, 18 –22). In the Phaedrus Socrates approaches philosophy as one ofthe f orms ofdivinely-inspired madness that have much beneﬁted mankind.126 SYRIANUS 330Cf. 14, 15 –16; 32, 23 –6: this causes dif ﬁculties later since Plato's Socrates confesses to wrong-doing and has to recant; such de ﬁciencies in Socrates are explained away at 74, 23–33; 76, 15 –19. 331253, 18 –25 (there is no reference to Pythagoras in the Phaedrus, but the connection is already made in Hierocles, In carm. aur. 111, 13 –14, above, p. 115).

There are some differences in emphasis, but this has to do with differences in the texts being interpreted. Socrates is the key ﬁgure in Hermias. Yet there are indications ofthe subordination to Pythagoras that is so emphatic in the Commentary on the Metaphysics. The positive aspect ofSyrianus' evaluation ofAristotle is predominant in Hermias. The negative aspect —Aristotle's errors in metaphysics (theology) —is eclipsed: for theology in the Phaedrus higher and more relevant authorities could be used, Plato himself, Orpheus, Homer, whereas Aristotle's Metaphysics is the primary theological text with which Syrianus' Commentary must contend. Finally the general position ofPlotinus, Porphyry, and Iamblichus as the more recent heirs ofthe Pythagorean tradition is less explicit in Hermias, although ofcourse these philosophers aretreated implicitly as members ofit.Yet Hermias' Commentary makes one signi ﬁcant contribution to what is known ofSyrianus' views on philosophy in the Commentary on the Metaphysics : it makes clear the revelatory and soteriological nature ofphilosophy and the connection ofthis with interpretation ofthe Phaedrus. True philosophers are divine-like souls who have not cut themselves off f rom participation in the vision ofthe heavenly retinue ofthe Phaedrus. To this they owe their superior wisdom. By communicating this divine wisdom to fallen souls they help bring about the return of the latter to their immaterialorigins.

One possible dif f erence —but a difference consistent with the general scheme —is the importance given to Homer in Syrianus. Yet this is hardly a new element, either in Syrianus or in Hierocles in whom we have already found it (above, p. 112). If Hierocles' approach tophilosophy is also Iamblichean in its general character, Syrianus seems to be closer to Iamblichus than is Hierocles, asregards at least —and this is not unimportant —the evaluation ofAristotle. Even where Syrianus has been f ound (above, p. 125) to disagree with Iamblichus, it is in a thoroughly Iamblichean manner: ﬁdelity to Plato and the ‘theologians ’requires his dissent. This case ofSyrianus being more Iamblichean than Iamblichus himselfwill be discussed in more detail below.One can show without much dif ﬁculty how it was possible for Syrianus to come so close to Iamblichus' views. Quite apart from what he may have learnt from Plutarch, he used Iamblichus' commentaries on the Phaedrus and on the Timaeus. 336He certainly exploited Iamblichus' On Pythagoreanism as a major source-book in his Commentary on the Metaphysics. As this fact has not yet been adequately noted,337it will require some attention here. It will also provide a starting-point from which Syrianus' metaphysical system may conveniently be approached. 3. Mathematics and Philosophy in Syrianus' Commentary on theMetaphysics (I)Syrianus'CommentaryandIamblichus'OnPythagoreanism Syrianus believes, as we have seen, that Aristotle's Metaphysics can be used in Platonic, i.e. ‘Pythagorean ’philosophy, if certain important128SYRIANUS 336Syrianus' references to Iamblichus, in his lectures on the Phaedrus (as reported by Hermias), indicate he is using Iamblichus' Commentary on the Phaedrus ; Proclus' Commentary on the Timaeus, which re ﬂects Syrianus' lectures, suggests that Syrianus referred to Iamblichus' Commentary on the Timaeus (Iamblichus, In Tim. fr. 7).</p><div id="pagenum"><p>337Although Praechter (1903), 257– 8, has pointed it out and collected some ofthe more important evidence.</p></div><div id="pagenum"><p>adjustments and corrections are supplied. This will entail reading the Metaphysics with the help ofguidelines (that must</p></div><p id="page">be suf ﬁciently differentiated and comprehensive) provided by true ‘Pythagorean ’philosophy. It is in this spirit that he prefaces his commentary on Books MNwith a synoptic account of ‘Pythagorean ’metaphysics (81, 31– 83, 31). But where are such guidelines to be found? Whence can such a synoptic account be derived?It has been shown above (p. 50) that ‘Pythagorean ’philosophy for Iamblichus consists in the main of two parts, or stages, (1) mathematics (including mathematical transpositions in physics, ethics, and theology), and (2) theology(metaphysics, the divine science or science ofthe gods).On the subject ofmathematics, Syrianus responds as f ollows to Aristotle's claim that mathematical objects are mereabstractions from sensible objects: But ifone f amiliarizes oneselfwith the noblest Pythagorean doctrines one will clearly comprehend the being, power,and activity ofall mathematical science. . . . (101, 26 –9) What follows for more than a page (101, 29 –102, 35) is a digest ofthe chapter headings ofIamblichus' On Pythagoreanism III ( Comm. 3, 7–8, 6) including variants showing that Syrianus is aware ofthe contents ofthe corresponding chapters. 338On Pythagoreanism III was therefore in Syrianus' opinion a basic text-book in Pythagorean general mathematics. On Pythagoreanism III was followed by books on each of the four mathematical sciences (Books IV, VIII –X). Corresponding to this Syrianus next suggests on the same page (102, 36 –8) that one learn the individual demonstrations in the mathematical sciences from the ‘leaders ’(ἡγɛμόνων) in mathematics, and he borrows the language ofPlato's Republic 527 d 8– e 2 (= Iamblichus Comm. 22, 20 –3) to express the intellectual regeneration and puri ﬁcation that mathematics can produce. Finally (103, 4 –10) he refers, as further reading, to ‘the collections ofPythagorean doctrines ofNicomachus and ofthe divine Iamblichus ’. We have seen that Iamblichus ( On Pyth. III) is the text-book Syrianus uses for ‘general ’mathematics. Iamblichus ( On Pyth. IV) is also Syrianus' source for ‘Pythagorean ’arithmetic.339The loss ofCOMMENTARY ON THE METAPHYSICS 129 338This is shown by Praechter (loc. cit). 339142, 15 –25 = Iamblichus, In Nic. 10, 12 –24; cf.

However Syrianus does not in any case have much recourse to those sciences in hisCommentary.Syrianus also read and used Iamblichus' ‘arithmetical physics ’and‘arithmetical theology ’(On Pythagoreanism V and VII). Indeed it is Syrianus' quotation from On Pythagoreanism Va t1 4 9 ,2 8 –31, that con ﬁrms the Iamblichean origin of Psellus' excerpts. What follows (149, 31 ff.) may also be inspired by On Pythagoreanism V. At 140, 15 Syrianus refers us toOn Pythagoreanism VII for the clearest account of the Pythagorean distinction between intelligible and intellectual monads (140, 10– 13; compare Iamblichus, On Pyth. VII, in Psellus, On Eth. Theol. arith. 72–4). There are a number of other passages in Syrianus which recall the arithmetical physics of On Pythagoreanism V and a smaller number ofplaces (corresponding to the smaller amount ofexcerpts in Psellus) which may be compared to the arithmetical ethics andtheology of On Pythagoreanism VI–VII. 340 IfIamblichus' On Pythagoreanism (in particular Books III, IV, V, VII) was Syrianus' source for Pythagorean mathematics (general mathematics, arithmetic, transpositions ofarithmetic), f or Pythagorean theology he had recourse to othersources besides the theological foreshadowings of arithmetic set forth in On Pythagoreanism VII. In Chapter 4 I have argued that Iamblichus' work On God (orOn the Gods ) completed the curriculum ofPythagorean philosophy begun in On Pythagoreanism and that it is likely that On(the)God(s) included exegesis ofthe Sacred Discourse attributed to Pythagoras. Syrianus cites the Sacred Discourse a number of times, once immediately after referring to On Pythagoreanism VII (140, 14 –18)—thus precisely in the order required by Iamblichus' curriculum —and again at 10, 5; 123, 2 and 175, 4 where it is compared to the ‘theologies ’ofPlato, Orpheus, and Parmenides. 341These passages show that for Syrianus theSacred Discourse was a source-book for ‘Pythagorean theology ’. Hierocles also used, as we have seen, the Sacred Discourse as a theological source. From these texts Syrianus derived the interpretation ofPythagorean philosophy in the light ofwhich he read and, whennecessary, corrected Aristotle's Metaphysics. If, as I have argued in Chapter 3, Iamblichus had in On Pythagoreanism VII discussed and responded at130SYRIANUS 340Cf. below Appendix I. Compare in particular Syrianus, In met. 190, 30 –3, with Psellus, On Phys. Num. 8–11; Syrianus, 188, 1 –4 with Psellus, On Phys. Num. 48–9. Syrianus summarizes On Pyth. I(Vit.

As Iamblichus had begun the construction in On Pythagoreanism VII ofa ‘Pythagorean ’theology or metaphysics, in part through reaction to the Metaphysics, so Syrianus, in possession ofsuch a theology, could respond at greater length and in detail to the Aristotelian text. (II)TheTripartiteStructureofRealityinSyrianus As noted above, Syrianus prefaces his detailed response to Aristotle's attack in Metaphysics MN on Platonism –Pythagoreanism with a synopsis oftrue, ‘Pythagorean ’metaphysics (81, 31 ff.), i.e. the Pythagorean –Pla- tonic theory ofForms and ofnumbers, which he takes to be (unjustly) criticized by Aristotle. Syrianus' synopsis doesnot therefore cover the full extent of the Pythagorean structure of reality. But it does present a fairly systematicframework that can be ﬁlled out in more detail and extended by reference to other parts of his Commentary. Pythagorean reality, according to Syrianus, is arranged in three main levels, the intelligible ( νοητή), the discursive (διανοητ ή), and the sensible ( αἰσθητή). 342At each level Forms are to be found that match the particular ontological characteristics ofthe level (81, 38 –82, 2). The intelligible Forms are ‘by the gods ’(παϱὰθεοι ̑ς) and ‘complete ’the ranks ofthe divine (82, 3 and 12– 13)—these vague formulations will be clari ﬁed later. The discursive Forms imitate the intelligible Forms, assimilating the psychic order to the intelligible (82, 14– 15). As contemplated by divine and demonic souls, discursive Forms function as demiurgic principles. But for souls that have fallen, as in the Phaedrus, from contemplation and thus from the power of making, they are no more than objects of knowledge.343We have access to them in virtue ofthe f act that the demiurge ofPlato's Timaeus constructed soul through geometric, arithmetical, and harmonic analogies (82, 20 –2). In this way discursive Forms are innate in us and make possible the recollection of Forms in the fallen soul (82, 25). These Forms are ‘universals ’(καθόλουλ όγοι), not in Aristotle's sense, as abstracted from sensible objects, but as existing a priori asCOMMENTARY ON THE METAPHYSICS 131 342For this division in Iamblichus, cf . above, p. 44 (Iamblichus' text is very probably the source ofinspiration ofSyrianus' tripartite division ofreality).</p><div id="pagenum"><p>34382, 15 –20; cf. Praechter (1932), 1746.</p></div><div id="pagenum"><p>part ofthe being ofsouls (82, 26 –8). However for higher souls, as noted above, they are also demiurgic principles</p></div><p id="page">guiding the causes immanent in and organizing nature (82, 28– 9). These immanent causes ( λόγοια ἴτια), which are inseparable from sensible bodies, represent the lowest level at which form is found (83, 5 –7). To all levels ‘the Pythagoreans ’applied mathematical terms, not because they were unable to distinguish between levels, but because of the relation ofimage to model linking each level to the level above it.344 In what follows I shall attempt to ﬁll out this general scheme with what can be gleaned from other parts of Syrianus' Commentary, beginning with the intermediate, ‘discursive ’level—where numbers, properly speaking, are found —and then considering how numbers function in paradigmatic extrapolation in physics, as the causes of sensible bodies, andhow they anticipate and express the objects ofmetaphysics, true being and the divine. (III)NumberandtheSoul The relation between the objects ofmathematics and soul is, in what remains ofIamblichus' On Pythagoreanism, somewhat unclear. This is not the case in Syrianus: intermediate between intelligible and sensible reality, the objects ofmathematics are part ofthe nature ofsoul (4, 5 –11). As we have seen, mathematicals have a double function, as principles guiding the demiurge action ofunf allen souls on the world 345and as innate universals in fallen souls allowing them to regain their lost knowledge. The correspondence between the demiurgic principles ofunf allen souls and theinnate universals in fallen souls explains how we (the latter) are capable of scienti ﬁc demonstrations concerning the physical heavens and other material objects: by developing demonstrations applying to physical objects from ﬁrst principles, or universals, that we possess innately and cognitively ( γνωστικω ̑ς), we rehearse the actual constitution of these objects from the same principles functioning ‘demiurgically ’(δημιου ϱγικω ̑ς). 346Indeed, Syrianus argues, scienti ﬁc demonstration, as Aristotle understands it, is not possible ifwe f ollow Aristotle in132SYRIANUS 34483, 14 –26; Syrianus regards much of Aristotle's criticism as showing only a failure to grasp this point (cf. 180, 17 –25; 186, 30 –6). 345These are subordinates ofthe demiurge proper ofthe Timaeus (cf. 82, 15 –22).</p><div id="pagenum"><p>346Cf. 88, 24 –32; 97, 1 –5; 82, 36 –83, 1; 27, 30 –7; Duhem (1914), II 102 –3; also Proclus, In Tim.

For how could such principles be what is</p></div><p id="page">prior scienti ﬁcally, what is most clear and well known, as Aristotle claims, ifthey are derivatives ofsensible particulars? Aristotle's (anti-Platonic) view in Metaphysics M of‘universals ’, especially mathematical universals, as derived from particulars is inconsistent with his own understanding ofthe nature ofscienti ﬁc demonstration. Consistency is recovered ifsuch universals are regarded as principles existing prior to the sensible world, f unctioning cognitively inour souls and demiurgically in the souls that organize the world. 347 The relation between soul and mathematical objects requires further speci ﬁcation, however. Mathematicals constitute but a portion ofthe universals in the soul (84, 1 –3). What the other universals are is not quite clear in Syrianus, and we must turn to Proclus for further information on this point (below, p. 201). Furthermore, mathematicals appear atseveral levels in the soul. In producing soul the demiurge gives it number which may be called ‘ideal’(ɛἰδητικ ός) number —although it is not properly speaking ideal number, i.e. intelligible Form —to distinguish it from the number it produces from itself, mathematical or ‘monadic ’(μοναδικ ός) number. 348Some light is shed on soul's generation from its ideal or essential number ofmathematical number at 132, 14– 23, and 133, 10 –15, where Syrianus represents soul as producing mathematical numbers from two principles that it possesses within itself, a monad and a dyad. Thus we do,after all, ‘think up ’mathematical number, but not in Aristotle's sense: ou r souls contain essential numbers, images presumably ofintelligible Forms, in particular a monad and dyad that pre-contain all ofthe f ormal f eatures ofmathematical numbers and from which we generate mathematical numbers. A similar psychic generation takes placefor geometrical objects: geometrical ﬁgures are produced from essential, indivisible principles in the soul ( οὐσιώδɛις, ἀμεϱει̑ςλόγοι) when geometry, in its cognitive weakness, projects these in imagination, and thus in extension, so as to grasp them more easily. 349 There are several important advantages for the Platonist in this distinction between levels of mathematicals in the souland in the ideaCOMMENTARY ON THE METAPHYSICS 133 34790, 8–23; cf. 95, 29 –96, 6.

To understand physical phenomena we must relate them back ( ἀναϕοϱά)t o their paradigmatic mathematical principles (cf. 98, 16 –31; 155, 36 –156, 6). Indeed the world is organized by causes that, as patterned after number, can be described as ‘physical numbers ’. 351Syrianus speaks ofa science corresponding to this Iamblichean idea ofphysical number, ‘physical arithmetic ’(189, 13; 192, 2 –3). The differences between physical numbers and mathematical numbers (in particular monadic n umbers produced from essential numbers in the soul) must be carefully observed, for confusing them is the source of some of Aristotle's criticisms in the Metaphysics.352Thus the dyad that produces mathematical number is not that which produces physical solids (180, 22 –5). Yet the connections between physical and mathematical numbers justify Pythagorean analogies between physics andmathematics; mathematical numbers exemplify, they bring ou t formal properties that explain physical phenomena (cf. 143, 9 –10; 122, 28 –9). Such indeed is the ‘physical arithmetic ’developed in Iamblichus' On Pythagoreanism V and which Syrianus in part reproduces (above, p. 130). However, Syrianus' treatment ofthe subject is limited: he is concernedwith it to the extent that it involves distinctions134SYRIANUS 350Cf. Charles (1982), 192 (on Proclus). The theory that mathematicals are projections, imagings forth, of intelligible principles may go back to Iambl ichus (cf. Comm. 34, 7–12; 43, 21; 44, 9; Steel [1978 ], 63, 67 –8) and appears to have been adopted by Plutarch ofAthens (in Philoponus, In de an. 515, 20 –9; cf. Beierwaltes [1985 ], 260, Blumenthal [1975 ], 134 –6). Its background must be the interpretation ofwhat precisely might be the medium responsible f or the image status ofmathematicals in Plato's Rep., and the identi ﬁcation ofthe imagination ( ϕαντασ ία) with this medium. Charles (1971), 251, refers to Plotinus, IV 3, 30, where imagination acts as a mirror showing forth, articulating thought. Cf. below, p. 168. 351Cf. 122, 25 –7; 142, 27 and 32; 188, 5 and 10; 190, 22; Hermias refers brie ﬂyt o ɛἰδοποιο ὶἀϱιθμοί(In Phaedr. 16, 4–5).</p><div id="pagenum"><p>352Cf. 122, 25 –9; 143, 4 –10; 190, 35 –7; Proclus, In Tim.

Syrianus consequently has a good deal more to say about this metaphysical level ofreality. He understands the relation between Forms and numbers in a ‘Pythagorean ’ way: ideal numbers represent a Pythagorean way ofspeaking ofForms. Forms themselves are not (mathematical)numbers, 353but by referring to Forms as numbers the Pythagoreans expressed through mathematical analogy signiﬁcant ontological (formal and dynamic) features of Forms. Forms can be described as numbers in that as causes they act as measures for their effects, ﬁtting them together and unifying them (103, 15 –104, 2; 134, 22 –6). The Forms constitute a decad in the sense that they are a comprehensive paradigm for the world, just as the decad contains allnumbers (147, 29 –148, 9). And just as number is produced from a monad and dyad, so there are two principles producing Forms which, by reason of their analogous function, can be referred to as monad and dyad (cf. 132, 14– 20; 134, 22– 35; 48, 23 –5). However the fact that the realm of Forms is being approached through analogies starting from their images, mathematical numbers, must not be ignored, since mathematical numbers operate with units andquantity, features not relevant to a proper account of Forms (131, 37 –132, 2; 186, 30 –5). The difference between a mathematical foreshadowing of the formal characteristics of pure Form and a true knowledge of the Forms is foundalso in the distinction Syrianus makes (as did Iamblichus) between the demonstrative method ofmathematics and thehigher, direct insight ( ἐπιβολ ή) whereby metaphysics attains its objects (4, 29 –5, 2). Yet even when it comes to expressing the relation between metaphysics and the sciences subordinate to it (mathematics and physics), Syrianuscannot avoid mathematical analogy. In reply to Aristotle's puzzle in Metaphysics B 1, as to whether metaphysics should study (only) the ﬁrst causes ofsubstances, or also the principles ofall demonstrations, Syrianus def ends the latter alternative on the grounds that metaphysics,COMMENTARY ON THE METAPHYSICS 135</p><div id="pagenum"><p>353Cf. 103, 15 ff.; 186, 30 –5; 45, 33 –46, 5; for the difference between Forms and universals in the soul cf. 105, 37 –106, 5.</p></div><div id="pagenum"><p>like a monad, pre-contains the principles ofall the sciences subordinate to it (3, 17 –30).</p></div><p id="page">It is clear that Syrianus identi ﬁes Aristotelian metaphysics, the science ofbeing, with ‘dialectic ’, the study ofpure intelligible being (or the Forms) ofPlato's Republic.354Both in turn relate in some way to the Pythagorean science ofthe divine which is to be found also in the theology of Plato's Parmenides (cf. 121, 5; 126, 15 –16). This theology deals with the divine characterized as ‘divine number ’(θει ̑οςἀϱιθμός) in the same way as the Forms are called ‘ideal numbers ’.355 Pythagorean –Platonic theology, it seems, concerns more than the Forms: higher principles come within its scope. Before such principles are introduced, an important differentiation within the realm of Forms must ﬁrst be noted. In Chapter 3 above a distinction was found in On Pythagoreanism VII between ‘intelligibles ’(νοητά) and ‘intellectuals ’ (νοɛϱά). It reappears in Syrianus' Commentary (cf. 4, 17 –18) and expresses itselfas a distinction between ‘intelligible ’ and‘intellectual ’numbers (122, 31 –2). Indeed Syrianus refers us to On Pythagoreanism for the difference between intelligible and intellectual monads (140, 11 –15). Syrianus also introduces the distinction in his exegesis ofsome (Pythagorean? Orphic?) verses at 106, 15 ff.: Forms come to be ‘intelligibly ’and‘tetradically ’in the ‘ideal animal ’(τὸ αὐτοζῳ̑ον) and then ‘intellectually ’and‘decadically ’in the demiurgic intellect. The language indicates that this is in fact an interpretation ofPlato's Timaeus in which the problem ofthe relation between demiurge and model is solved by subordinating the demiurge to the model.356Mathematical expression is given to the subordination: the demiurgic intellect comprises the Forms fully articulated as are the numbers in the decad, whereas the ‘ideal animal ’contains the Forms in the way that the tetrad contains the essential features of numbers; the ideal animal is to the demiurge as thetetrad is to the decad. Thus mathematical relations can serve to formulate the structure internal to the realm of Forms.The‘intellectual decad ’ofForms is subordinate and pre-contained then in a more uni ﬁed way in the ‘intelligible tetrad’ which itselfderives f rom two more ultimate principles, a monad and dyad.

The supra-intelligible monad, as a unity, itself presupposes a higher principle, the ultimate origin, the One. Although Syrianus' need to invoke theological authoritiessometimes blurs rather than sharpens these distinctions between the ultimate One, the supra-intelligible monad anddyad and the intelligible monad and dyad, they emerge with suf ﬁcient clarity from the following two passages: It seems to me that Empedocles supposes ‘Friendship ’to be nothing other than the One, not the One that is not co-ordinate with anything 〈i.e. the ultimate One 〉, but that which is co-ordinate with the unlimited dyad, which he refers to as ‘Strife ’, from〈both of〉which what primarily is and all the intelligibles and the sensible world come to be. (11, 28 –31; cf. 43, 11 –20) 〈To Aristotle's argument in Metaphysics N 1〉one should say that these men 〈the Pythagoreans 〉include in the ﬁrst causes, not such opposites as are non-beings in the sense ofbeing inf erior to being, but . . . such as are non- beings in the sense ofsuperior to being. For the ﬁrst principles ofbeings 〈or Forms〉must transcend being. And yet these men did not begin from opposites 〈i.e. monad/dyad, limit/unlimited 〉, but they were aware ofwhat transcends the two opposite orders, witness Philolaus 〈the Pythagorean 〉who says god produced limit and the unlimited. 358 Some ofthe elements ofthis metaphysical structure can be f ound in Hermias' Commentary on the Phaedrus. Reality, in Hermias, also culminates in an ultimate One (121, 19). He too assumes a distinction between the ‘intelligible ’and ‘intellectual ’orders (134, 3 –4; 89, 8 –15). And he alludes to a supra-intelligible level in the following text: But ifyou were to contemplate the beautif ul, the wise and the good according to a mode transcending the gods'intellect, you should say that there is a light 359proceeding from the Good . . .

One difference regards the level intervening between the ultimateOne and intelligible being (the Forms). In Iamblichus it seems that this level included not only monad and dyad, butalso triad and (probably) the following members of a supra-intelligible decad. These ‘divine numbers ’constitute the most uni ﬁed order ofmembers who are themselves unities. Yet in Syrianus it appears that only a monad and dyad inhabit this level. This may, however, be a matter ofemphasis and context. Hermias ref ers to the principles that f ollowthe ultimate One as ‘theﬁrst henads ’(121, 19). Syrianus also speaks of ‘monads or henads which proceed from the veryﬁrst cause ’(In Met. 183, 24 –5) and he makes a distinction, for Forms prior to the demiurgic (i.e. ‘intellectual ’) Forms, between ‘uniﬁed’(ἑνιαι ̑ος) and ‘essential ’(οὐσιώδης) numbers (126, 17) —since the latter constitute the intelligible order, the former must represent the order above it. And if the supra-intelligible level in Syrianus contains‘henadic numbers ’, it seems reasonable to expect that it extends beyond monad and dyad to the following (properly speaking) numbers ofa decad. 360 Clear disagreement between Iamblichus and Syrianus can be detected however on some speci ﬁc points. A particularly revealing case is f ound in Hermias. At issue is the interpretation ofthe company oftwelve gods, led by Zeus, in thePhaedrus (246 e). Some possible exegeses are examined and rejected and then that ofIamblichus is introduced (136, 17–29): However the divine Iamblichus, noting the name Zeus, relates the passage to the one demiurge ofthe universe whois spoken ofin the Timaeus〈i.e. the138 SYRIANUS 360This allows us to explain the relation between Syrianus' supra-intelligible monad –dyad pair and the doctrine ofdivine henads attributed to Syrianus by Proclus ( In Parm.</p><div id="pagenum"><p>1062, 20 –34; Theol. Plat. I lxxxvi). The problem posed by this relation is raised by Sheppard (1982).</p></div><div id="pagenum"><p>‘intellectual ’demiurge〉. But we, here also admiring the man's insight ( ἐπιβολ ή), would add only this: that by Zeus</p></div><p id="page">is not to be understood simply the one and transcendent demiurge, for this transcendent demiurge does not have a particular place in the ‘army ’〈ofthe Phaedrus〉, . . . but is present equally in all ranks. ...T h i si st h e no u r view, following Plato and the theologians: after the demiurgic monad, the one and transcendent Zeus, come three Zeuses . . . each of whom hassubordinate to him four further gods. Zeus is found at three levels: the transcendent demiurge proper on the ‘intellectual ’level; below him a triad; and below this twelve gods, led by the Zeus ofPlato's Phaedrus. 361Ofparticular interest is the source ofSyrianus' disagreement with Iamblichus. The latter had identi ﬁed the Zeus ofthe Phaedrus, theﬁrst member ofa series oftwelve, with the demiurge ofthe Timaeus. But, for Syrianus, the demiurge is not the ﬁrst ofa series oftwelve. He is rather a transcendent intellectual monad, principle (via a triad) ofthe series oftwelve as a whole. In other words preciselybecause ofthe sort ofmathematical principles that Iamblichus had used f or theology —here in particular the distinction between the ﬁrst (immanent) member ofa series and the transcendent principle ofthe series as a whole —his interpretation ofthe theology ofthe Phaedrus must be amended. 362Proclus reports another case ofSyrianus being more rigorous in his application ofmathematics than Iamblichus,363and the general spirit ofthis disagreement is well expressed by a later member ofthe Athenian school: This is Simplicius' work, Iamblichus bestower ofblessings,Forgive my defeating you, but it is through your words! 364 It is likely enough that were more to be recovered ofIamblichus' lost works and were a truly comprehensive anddetailed treatment by Syrianus of the structure of reality available, other differences could be noted. Usefulcomparisons could also be made between the hosts oflesser deities and demons in Iamblichus' On Mysteries and their counterparts, ‘hypercosmic ’and‘encosmic ’—ofwhich the ‘jovial ’COMMENTARY ON THE METAPHYSICS 139 361Cf. also 137, 6 –10; 138, 27 –139, 1; 142, 10 –12; Proclus, In Tim.

One might mention here also Syrianus' insistence, against Iamblichus, that the ultimate One is not to be treated as ifco-ordinate with the henads in the interpretation ofthe ﬁrst hypothesis ofthe Parmenides (cf.

Enough evidence has, however,</p></div><p id="page">been collected, I believe, to conclude that Syrianus' general approach to the structure ofreality owes much toIamblichus, and in particular to On Pythagoreanism. Number permeates this structure, not in virtue ofthe crude identi ﬁcations ofnumbers with things that Aristotle ﬁnds in the Pythagoreans, but in virtue ofthe intermediate and pivotal status ofmathematical objects: as exemplars ofthe physical world they express paradigmatically the f ormalprinciples immanent in the world; as lower images they foreshadow their origins, the realm of Forms and its ownultimate principles. In distinguishing between many levels or sorts ofnumber —physical, mathematical or psychic, intellectual, intelligible, henadic or divine —Syrianus follows Iamblichus' example and also emphasizes Iamblichus' point that this expresses the transposability ofmathematicals to other domains. The result, in Syrianus as inIamblichus, is a ‘physical arithmetic ’and a ‘theological arithmetic ’. Ifthe latter is much more f ully represented in Syrianus' Commentary on the Metaphysics than in the few remains of Iamblichus' On Pythagoreanism VII, its function on the whole is somewhat negative: it acts as a standard against which Aristotle's anti-Pythagoreanism is corrected, ratherthan as a science presented in its own right. However, enough emerges to indicate that Syrianus, like Iamblichus, ﬁnds in mathematics distinctions and relationships that can be used to describe the characteristics ofForms, the structure ofthe realm ofForms, and its relation to a higher order, that of‘henads ’, which is also approached in mathematical terms. Syrianus is as aware as is Iamblichus that such a ‘theological arithmetic ’is based merely on analogy. Besides the evidence given above from Syrianus' Commentary, a good example ofthis methodological caution can be f ound in Hermias. The subject in question is again the series oftwelve gods ofthe Phaedrus : Some ﬁt, in an arithmetical way, each ofthe ten gods (subtracting two monads f rom the twelve) ...t ot h et e n numbers ofthe decad ...,g iving the monad to Apollo, the dyad to Hera,. . . But 〈the text〉is not to be understood in a simple arithmetical fashion, but each g od organizes and is provident according to his characteristic (ἰδιότης). . . . The characteristic ofeach is to be learnt f rom theology. . . . So there are certain characteristics in numbers which imitate the characteristics ofthe gods and are thus transposed to them. (139, 3–20). Syrianus rejects the simple identi ﬁcations ofnumbers with gods f ound in traditional Pythagorean decadic works such</p><div id="pagenum"><p>as that attributed to140SYRIANUS</p></div><div id="pagenum"><p>Anatolius. Ifhe f requently compares the numbers with the gods365it is on the basis oftranspositions whose basis and</p></div><p id="page">limitations he recognizes. Mathematics can help to lead us to higher things (191, 10 –12). It can function as a ‘bridge ’—Nicomachus' image used by Syrianus in his Commentary (In Met. 96, 28 –30). But its discursive methods and the images it uses are inferior in metaphysics to the direct ‘insight ’into the Forms and what transcends them such as is revealed by the inspired poets and the divine souls ofPythagorean philosophers.COMMENTARY ON THE METAPHYSICS 141</p><div id="pagenum"><p>365Cf. e.g. Hermias, 90, 21 ff.; 137, 4 –6; 138, 11 –13.</p></div><div id="pagenum"><p>7Proclus:SomePreliminaryIssues</p></div><p id="page">‘A great haven ’: so Michael Psellus described the enormous collection of Proclus' works from which he could so often distil his own philosophical writings. Psellus' interest is no doubt responsible in part for the preservation of so much ofthis collection. But presumably it had imposed itselfin such a way as to supplant the works ofothers long bef ore, inthe days ofProclus' disciples and successors at Athens. 366The thousands ofpages ofProclus that have survived represent, however, but a small fraction of the original corpus. Yet there is more than enough to provide information on questions that remain unanswered in the scarce remains ofthe works ofIamblichus and Syrianus. This makes itpossible not only to approach Proclus' work from the point of view of Iamblichus' programme to revivePythagoreanism, but also to ﬁll some gaps in this programme, at least as it was understood and adapted by Proclus. For this reason our discussion ofProclus can be much f uller than is possible in the case ofSyrianus. Given, however,our limited purposes in Part II, a selective rather than a comprehensive treatment ofProclus will be appropriate.Proclus produced his works during a long lifetime of great and regular industriousness. It seems then reasonable tosuppose that his ideas might have developed or changed in the course ofthis long activity. However, f ew ofhis workscan be assigned to speci ﬁc periods ofhis lif e. 367His pupil Marinus tells us ( Vita Procli, ch. 13) that the Commentary on the Timaeus was written when Proclus was a young man, still very much under the in ﬂuence (one could assume) of Syrianus. The work On Providence was written when Proclus was no longer young ( §45, 5– 11). The Platonic Theology is certainly later than the Commentary on the Parmenides.368However an attempt to argue that the Elements ofPhysics is a very early work has not been successful.369It has been suggested that the Elements ofTheology might also be early, in view of 366Cf. Saffrey and Westerink, in Proclus, Theol. Plat. I clii; Segonds (1985 –6), liv ff. 367On this question cf. Saffrey and Westerink, in Proclus, Theol. Plat.

On the other hand the Platonic Theology has been thought to show, in its style, signs ofsenility,371a suggestion that would be dif ﬁcult to prove. The cross-references in Proclus' works tend to show that he could also revise his works at later stages.372It has been convincingly argued on the basis of differences in doctrine that the essays constituting the Commentary on the Republic were written at different periods of Proclus' life.373However doctrinal comparisons between works or parts ofworks can in some cases yield only tentative results.374In general then one has little choice but to approach Proclus on a systematic rather than chronological basis. However, the precaution can betaken of considering each work individually, in so far as this is possible, so as to allow what doctrinal differences theremight be between the works to emerge. 1.TheRivalryWiththeMathematicianDominusofLarissa Proculus' fellow-pupil and colleague Hermias left Athens at some point after his studies with Syrianus and went toAlexandria where he, and more especially his son Ammonius, would train an important group ofNeoplatonicphilosophers. The relations between the two ex-pupils ofSyrianus appear to have been good: Hermias married arelative ofSyrianus, and their son Ammonius went to Athens to receive his philosophical education f rom Proclusbefore returning to Alexandria to become himself a very in ﬂuential teacher. Syrianus had, however, another pupil in the ﬁnal years ofhis lif e, Domninus ofLarissa, whose relations with Proclus became far from friendly. 375Marinus, Proclus' biographer, or rather encomiast (and successor), reports in his Life of Proclus:RIVALRY WITH DOMINUS OF LARISSA 143 370Cf. Dodds, op. cit. xvi –xvii; but cf. Trouillard's comments (1965), 45. 371Cf. Dodds, op. cit, xv. 372Cf. Dodds, loc. cit. 373Sheppard (1980), 15 –21, 34 –8. 374Cf. Blumenthal (1975). 375Proclus' reference to ‘my colleague Domninus ’inIn Tim. I 109, 30 –110, I (cf. 122, 18 –20; the report ofDomninus' views may extend to 123, 10) is not unf riendly and is</p><div id="pagenum"><p>probably an echo f rom the period oftheir common study ofPlato's Timaeus under Syrianus.</p></div><div id="pagenum"><p>〈Syrianus 〉proposed to interpret for him 〈i.e. Proclus 〉and for the philosopher and successor, the Syrian</p></div><p id="page">Domninus, either the poems ofOrpheus or the 〈‘Chaldaean 〉Oracles ’, and he asked them to choose. But since they did not agree, each making a different choice, 〈Domninus〉 preferring Orpheus and our 〈Proclus〉the ‘Oracles ’, Syrianus, who also had not long to live, was prevented 〈from realizing his project 〉.376 This report is disturbing not only on account ofits portrayal ofan unseemly disharmony between Syrianus' pupils inthe last days oftheir master's lif e. More disconcerting is the suggestion that the successor ofSyrianus was not theyoung and brilliant Proclus, but Domninus. However, it is possible that the phrase ‘the philosopher and successor ’in Marinus is in fact a marginal gloss explaining the word ‘him’in the text, a gloss which, as frequently happens, was later incorporated in the body ofthe text. 377Since this is the only piece ofevidence in f avour ofDomninus' succession to Syrianus, and since, in one interpretation, it can be set aside, it does not provide a strong enough basis for claiming thatDomninus, not Proclus, succeeded Syrianus. 378 However the disagreement between Proclus and Domninus was clear, and it went further. Proclus wrote a specialtreatise directed against Domninus, in which he ‘puriﬁed’Plato's doctrines. 379Thus Domninus was regarded as a ‘heretic ’who corrupted the Platonic heritage, which therefore required, as it had in Numenius' time, puri ﬁcation. We are not told ofthe nature ofthe corruption f or which Domninus was allegedly responsible. Damascius, pupil ofAmmonius and ofMarinus, allows Domninus mathematical skill but ﬁnds him a superﬁ cial philosopher. 380An example ofDomninus' inadequacy as a philosopher is given: the oracle ofAsclepius at Athens prescribed to Domninus and toPlutarch, Syrianus' teacher, the eating ofpork to cure them ofan illness. Domninus duly carried out the prescriptionalthough it violated the law ofhis land (so Damascius), whereas Plutarch got the oracle to come up with a prescriptionmore compatible with religious beliefs. 381The story not only dissociates Domninus144 PROCLUS: SOME PRELIMINARY ISSUES 376Vita Procli, ch. 26. 377Hultsch (1905), 1522; Saffrey and Westerink, in Proclus, Theol. Plat. I, xvii –xix. 378Proclus' succession to Syrianus is attested elsewhere in Marinus' Vita Procli (chs. 12, 36); cf.

It is thus against Iamblichean criteria f or the true philosopherthat Domninus was found wanting.Considering the purge which Domninus suffered at the hands of Proclus, it is remarkable that some of his work, albeitlittle, has survived. It is no doubt due to its pedagogical excellence that Domninus' short Manual ofIntroductory</p></div><p id="page">Arithmetic was preserved in company with other mathematical introductions such as Nicomachus' Introduction to Arithmetic, Nicomachus' Manual ofHarmonics, and Euclid's Elements. 382Domninus' manual provides a very clear and simple explanation ofthe main terms, concepts, and distinctions in the theory ofnumbers. The concision andorderliness ofhis exposition is not interrupted by extra-mathematical inf erences or learned additions such as appear inNicomachus' Introduction and in Iamblichus' version ofNicomachus ( On Pyth. IV). Domninus' use ofEuclidean ideas in hisManual has even provoked a modern admirer to see in his work a rejection ofthe Nicomachean tradition of arithmetic as perpetuated by Iamblichus and Proclus and a return to the ‘mathematically sounder ’Euclidean approach to arithmetic. 383This seems exaggerated: Domninus makes extensive use ofNicomachus in his Manual and his chief contribution consists in the clarity and simplicity absolutely essential to a work as short as his.384At the end ofthe Manual he promises an Elements ofArithmetic (ἀϱιθμητικ ὴστοιχ ɛίωσις), probably a more ambitious project in which he intended to explain, among other things, mathematical theories in Plato.385 2.PlatoandPythagoras The dispute with Domninus had little effect on Proclus' professional career.

The ef f ect ofthe con ﬂict on</p></div><p id="page">Proclus' intellectual lif e is less easily gauged since so little is known ofDomninus' ideas and ofthe details ofProclus'argument with him. The reports ofProclus' successors considered above, ifthey may be taken to re ﬂect the master's view, suggest that Proclus felt it necessary to insist on the proper (Iamblichean) acceptance of religious customs in thef ace ofDomninus' heterodox practice, and on the place and (especially) limits ofmathematics in philosophy. The latterpoint will be discussed in more detail below. It will be appropriate, however, to begin our study ofProclus with someconsideration ofhis views on the nature, f unction, and history ofphilosophy.His views on these topics are in general the same, it would appear, as those ofIamblichus and ofSyrianus. One doesnot have to read far into his major commentaries to ﬁnd Pythagoreans and Orphics quoted as authorities supporting Plato. Aristotle is given a subordinate place: he is sometimes right, frequently mistaken. 386It is assumed that true Greek philosophy agrees with, and can be illustrated by, the inspired poetry ofHomer and Hesiod and the barbarianrevelations ofthe ‘Chaldaean Oracles ’. 387 A text from the opening of the Platonic Theology (I, ch. 5, 25, 24 –26, 9) may serve to indicate in particular the relation between Pythagoras and Plato: But we must show that each ofthese doctrines is in harmony with the ﬁrst principles ofPlato and with the secret revelations ofthe theologians. For all Greek theology derives f rom Orphic mystagogy, Pythagoras ﬁrst (πϱώτου) learning from Aglaophemus the secrets concerning the gods, Plato after him ( δɛυτέϱου) receiving the complete science ofthe gods f rom Pythagorean and Orphic writings. For in attributing in the Philebus the doctrine ofthe two kinds ofprinciples to the Pythagoreans, he calls them ‘dwellers with the gods ’(16 c 8) and blessed. Indeed Philolaus the Pythagorean has written many wonderful things about these 〈ﬁrst principles 〉. Plato's theology, or science ofthe divine, is then Pythagorean in inspiration. Proclus' authority f or this, as the ref erenceto Aglaophemus indicates, is the same as that used for the same purpose by Iamblichus and Syrianus, namely the(pseudo-) Pythagorean Sacred146 PROCLUS: SOME PRELIMINARY ISSUES 386Below, Ch. 9.</p><div id="pagenum"><p>387On Proclus' treatment of inspired poetry and its relation to Syrianus' theory, cf. Sheppard (1980), 95 ff., 162 –82.</p></div><div id="pagenum"><p>Discourse.388The Sacred Discourse is also referred to as the authority for the Orphic and Pythagorean source of Greek, i.e.</p></div><p id="page">Platonic, theology in the Commentary on the Timaeus (III 161, 3 –6). In Chapter 9 below evidence will be presented showing that in the Commentary on the Timaeus Proclus also regards Plato's physics as ‘Pythagorean ’. Finally, in providing valuable information on the history of mathematics in his Commentary on Euclid Proclus gives Pythagoras a pivotal role: he credits him with the introduction ofa philosophical approach to geometry, as compared with the non-philosophicalapproach that preceded it: 389 After these 〈Thales, Mamercus 〉Pythagoras transformed the understanding 〈‘philosophy ’〉ofgeometry so that it could serve to educate the free man, examining its ﬁrst principles from a basis transcending them and investigating the theorems in an immaterial and intellectual manner. In other words Pythagoras raised geometry to the role mathematics is given in Plato's Republic : to introduce the soul to immaterial reality; to receive its grounding for the true philosopher in more ultimate principles.Proclus also accepted his teacher's Iamblichean understanding ofthe history ofphilosophy as a tradition oftherevelation ofdivine truth by the souls not only ofPlato, but also ofPlotinus, Porphyry, Iamblichus, and even Syrianushimself. 390He too considers the souls oftrue philosophers to be superior to ordinary souls, to be participants in the divine vision ofthe Phaedrus that are sent down to save mankind. Thus his interpretation ofthe ﬁgure and function of Socrates in the Alcibiades, in his Commentary on that dialogue, is in its essentials the same as Syrianus' treatment of Socrates in the Phaedrus. Already the etymology ofSocrates' name as Proclus understands it —‘saviour ofthe strength ofthe soul ’(In Crat. 8, 18–19)—indicates the nature of his function. There is much more information to be found in Proclus on the theory ofsuperior saving souls, and I shall return to it in more detail in the next section.In general, then, philosophy for Proclus, as for Iamblichus and Syrianus, is a tradition of divinely revealed truthconveyed to fallen souls for their salvation by a select, i.e. Platonic, succession of superiorPLATO AND PYTHAGORAS 147 388Cf.

In the texts cited above it appears also that Platonism, in theology, mathematics, and physics, can be reduced toPythagoreanism. However this reduction, although occurring in Proclus, is not as radical as it is in Iamblichus andSyrianus, and does not give a balanced view ofProclus' general attitude to the relation between Pythagoras and Plato.As this point is ofsome consequence in determining Proclus' position with respect to the ideas ofIamblichus andSyrianus and relates to important modi ﬁcations in the use he makes ofmathematics in philosophy, it will repay closer</p></div><p id="page">attention here.In reading Proclus, one soon notices that he tends to attribute so much importance to Plato that Plato emerges fromthe shadow ofPythagoras and even dominates him. This may be illustrated f rom the very same opening pages ofthePlatonic Theology in which Plato's dependence on ‘Pythagorean ’theology is stressed. While indicating brie ﬂy that Platonic philosophy had a long and changing life, Proclus insists that it was one man, Plato, who revealed the secrets oftheology to men (5, 6 –6, 7). The unique place ofPlato is stressed again a little later (13, 8 f f .), where Proclus claims that what distinguishes Plato's theology from that of the Orphics, Pythagoreans, and Chaldaeans is its scienti ﬁc character (20, 4 –25). Proclus is thinking here ofthe science ofdialectic which he takes to be the proper science oftheological objects and which he ﬁnds expounded in particular in Plato's Parmenides. He assumes that such a science is not to be found in the Pythagoreans, who employ an inferior approach, namely mathematical analogies directed upwards to thedivine (loc. cit.). Thus, from a scienti ﬁc point-of-view, Plato's dialectic is superior as theology to the mathematical theology ofthe Pythagoreans.A similar tendency to play down the scienti ﬁc claims ofthe Pythagoreans can already be f ound in the early and most Pythagoreanizing ofProclus' works, the Commentary on the Timaeus : there Proclus characterizes the Pythagorean approach as lofty, inspired, symbolic, anagogic, revelatory, whereas that ofSocrates is ethical, demonstrative (ἀποδ ɛικτικόν); in the Timaeus Plato combines the revelatory style ofPythagoreanism with the demonstrative method ofSocrates (17, 21 –8, 4). One will readily agree with Proclus that Plato's dialogues embody scienti ﬁc method far more than do such supposedly early Pythagorean works as the Sacred Discourse. But Proclus' recognition ofthis f act implies a signi ﬁcant revaluation ofthe respective importance ofPythagoras and Plato, and a noteworthy departure from Iamblichus' position. For Iamblichus, Pythagoras was the ﬁrst‘scienti ﬁc’philosopher.148</p><div id="pagenum"><p>PROCLUS: SOME PRELIMINARY ISSUES</p></div><div id="pagenum"><p>Hence Pythagorean literature was to be seen as the standard against which the rest ofGreek philosophy, includingPlato, was to be read. Plato was made more ‘scienti ﬁc’, i.e. more Pythagorean, through a syllogizing ofhis dialogues.</p></div><p id="page">For Proclus, however, Plato had greater claims to being scienti ﬁc. As a consequence Plato's dialogues receive a primacy and centrality in Proclus' philosophy that go beyond what is allowed for by Iamblichus' position. Speci ﬁc expressions and consequences of this important shift in perspective will be encountered further on.This contrast between Proclus and Iamblichus must not, however, be exaggerated. It would be misleading to conclude,for example, that Proclus had doubts about the authenticity and priority ofthe Pythagorean documents invoked by Iamblichus and Syrianus. Apart from the Sacred Discourse and Philolaus (his favourite Pythagorean authority), Proclus makes use ofthe Golden Verses, Timaeus ofLocri, the Hymn to Number, and other similar (pseudo-) Pythagorean works. 391Nor can it be inferred that Proclus went so far as to ﬁnd a doctrinal difference between Plato and Pythagoreanism. Rather, as Iamblichus believed that Pythagoras ﬁrst gave scienti ﬁc form to revelations of great (Chaldaean, Egyptian) antiquity, so Proclus included Orphism and Pythagoreanism in the ancient revelations and ﬁrst found scienti ﬁc expression ofthem in Plato. 3.TheTheoryofSuperiorSouls Often enough it has been noted that Proclus, following Iamblichus and Syrianus, did not accept Plotinus' contentionthat part ofthe human soul remains ‘above ’in the intelligible world even when the soul descends in its preoccupation with the material world. 392Hardly any notice has been taken, however, ofthe f act that certain quali ﬁcations need to be introduced into this view ofProclus' position. For him some souls possess a privileged connection with thetranscendentTHE THEORY OF SUPERIOR SOULS 149 391Cf.In Tim. I 199, 3 –4; 203, 25 –7; 316, 18 –24; II 8, 9 –10; 53, 2 –7 (for Timaeus of Locri cf. below, Ch. 9); In Remp. II 69, 2 –3. Proclus' usual practice, however, is to cite ‘the Pythagoreans ’in general, rather than speci ﬁc Pythagorean authorities and works. An exception is Philolaus, who is singled out in particular, it appears, for his closeness to Plato's Philebus ;c f. Theol. Plat.

Aspects ofthis theory have been encountered above in Iamblichus, Hierocles, and</p></div><p id="page">Syrianus. It can be found described in some detail in a number of Proclus' surviving works which thus allow of a fullerdescription and clari ﬁcation ofthe theory at least in the version that it assumes in Proclus. The Commentary on the Timaeus discusses at various points the different degrees in the descent of the soul in the world. At the top Proclus places the souls ofthe gods that do not descend into the world, but govern it f rom above withoutbeing affected or changed in any way in their transcendent independence. 393These divine souls are ‘accompanied’ without interruption by lower souls who never descend. Below these come souls who do descend, but remain pure(ἄχϱαντος), untarnished by vice and affections. And these are followed in turn by souls who not only descend but also become corrupted by the material world. 394From the ﬁrst two degrees ofthis structure it can be seen that it represents a formalization of the divine company of gods and their followers, unfallen and fallen, of the Phaedrus.395The Commentary elsewhere provides more details on the class ofdescended but pure souls: they accomplish great things in the world (I 111, 14 –19); their descent is accompanied by natural portents (113, 4 –7)—one thinks ofsuch portents as Iamblichus recounts in On the Pythagorean Life ; they are called ‘heroes ’by Plato (II 230, 7 –9)—the reference is to Cratylus 397 d, as will soon be clear; and, most importantly, they possess in their descent a superior knowledge inspired in them by the gods: the examples ofthe Sibyl and Heracles are given.396 Heracles is named again in the notes taken from Proclus' comments on Cratylus 397 d: there he is one ofa class of ‘heroic souls ’who descend into the material world but remain pure ( ἄχϱαντος) and more insightful ( νοɛϱώτɛϱος) than other descended souls. Such heroic souls descend so as to bene ﬁt(ɛὐɛϱγɛσία) mankind, sharing as they do in the part that‘weighs ’man down, but also in the power to lead up and escape from matter ( In Crat. 68, 17 –29). These souls are ‘heroes ’or150 PROCLUS: SOME PRELIMINARY ISSUES 393On these cf. Dodds, op. cit. 295 –6. 394III 259, 11 –27; cf. I 131, 28 –132, 5; II 112, 23 –5 (same theory in In Alc. §§32, 13 –34, 10). The systematic triadic arrangement ofeverything in the El. theol. leaves no room for the distinction between the third and fourth degrees in that work (cf. Propositions 185, 202, 204). 395Cf.

There, in discussing the ﬁgure ofEr in Plato's Republic, Proclus appears to hesitate as to whether Er possesses a soul superior in substance to other human souls or merely superior in kind oflif e (II 123, 23 –124, 12). Proclus prefers, it seems, to assign to Er a superior substance. At any rate, through his superiority, Er was given the power by the gods toreceive the vision which he imparts in the Republic (123, 14 –124, 8). A little later Proclus mentions other souls who have communicated to men divine mysteries, divination, medicine . . . (153, 5 –154, 5). He does not make clear the ontological rank(s) ofsuch souls, but suggests that soul can be raised to a superior rank by the divine theurgic power inthe universe as well as by philosophy (154, 1–12).Less compatible with the classi ﬁcations ofthe Commentaries on the Timaeus and on the Cratylus is the theory presented later in the same essay (331, 10– 332, 3) that ‘heroic souls ’, superior in being to human souls, descend into and assume a human existence. Ifthese heroic souls were to correspond to the souls ofthe heroes proper mentioned in Proclus'other two commentaries, then they ought not to descend. Neither do they correspond to the ‘heroic souls ’that occur in those works which are superior in relation, but not in being, to other human souls. It seems we must suppose thatthe psychic hierarchy is more complicated than it at ﬁrst appears, and includes undescending heroes, descending heroes in human form, descending pure human souls, and descendin g impure human souls. Or one might infer that Proclus changed his mind in his interpretation ofthe ontological rank ofthe heroic communicators ofdivine truth to man. Thelatter possibility might account for the difference between the ideas of the sixteenth essay and the fairly standarddoctrine ofthe commentaries on the Timaeus, Cratylus, and Alcibiades. But the fact that the various accounts of the doctrine in these commentaries are not necessarily exhaustive makes it dif ﬁcult to be certain about this.THE THEORY OF SUPERIOR SOULS 151 397In Crat. 68, 13 –19; 77, 14 –18; cf. In Remp. II 310, 18 –21; Dodds, loc. cit.

Proclus emphasizes the latter distinction in the Commentary on the Timaeus in arguing against Plotinus' view (as he understands it) that fallen human souls are identical in nature with those of thegods (III 245, 19 –246, 23). It nevertheless remains that in allowing for higher insight and divine inspiration in a certain class ofdescended souls, Proclus preserves at least f or part ofhumanity that access to higher truth that Plotinus'theory was designed to make possible. 398 4.Learning,Discovery,andRevelation Besides providing more details on the ontological character and place ofthe superior descended souls whocommunicate insight to man, Proclus also throws light on some problems connected with their saving mission. One ofthese problems has been raised above in Part I on the subject ofIamblichus' interpretation ofthe ﬁgure ofPythagoras: Pythagoras is said to have ‘discovered’ many things, but how is this to be related to the impression given that he learnt much from the Egyptians and Chaldaeans and with the claim that he (merely) revealed divinely inspired truths?Another problem may also be raised: can fallen souls, by their own efforts —as appears to be the case in Plotinus —return to true intelligible insight, or do they depend entirely on the intervention ofsuperior souls to make their return possible? Much help with these questions can be found in Proclus' Commentary on the Alcibiades which, in so far as it discusses the interaction between Socrates and Alcibiades in the dialogue, is largely devoted to explaining theproblems and methods ofa philosophical, i.e. soteriological, education.It is clear from Proclus' commentary, ﬁrst ofall, that learning f rom another and discovering by oneselfare not to be distinguished in such a way as to represent alternatives in the acquisition ofknowledge. Rather, both learning anddiscovery are to be understood as a process ofrecollection: in learning, the pupil is guided by the teacher so as to152PROCLUS: SOME PRELIMINARY ISSUES 398One might also mention in this regard Proclus' doctrine ofthe ‘ﬂower’ofthe soul which, in providing an ontological link with the transcendent, also mitigates his anti-</p><div id="pagenum"><p>Plotinian position; cf. Grondijs (1960), 37 ff.; Beierwaltes (1963), 261 –6; (1985), 174 –82.</p></div><div id="pagenum"><p>discover within himselfthe knowledge that is innate in his soul. More advanced souls also discover the knowledgeinnate in them, but are capable ofthis without having so much recourse to a teacher. There are theref ore degrees inlearning –discovery relating to the degrees to which the souls have fallen: at lower degrees souls require teachers and</p></div><p id="page">guides to arouse or provoke in them the discovery which is self-discovery; at higher degrees souls are more capable ofsuch discovery and require less guidance. 399These ideas might be suitably applied, I believe, as a Procline account of Pythagoras in his role as both scienti ﬁc discoverer and pupil ofbarbarian sages: his discovery ofthe sciences was a self - discovery, a disclosure ofthe intelligible principles innate in his soul; f or this purpose, in his youth at least, somestimulation was provided by his teachers, although one must assume that, in view ofthe superior status ofhis soul, hisneed for this was minimal!Both Pythagoras and his teachers revealed divinely-inspired truths. However we must be careful again not to set divineinspiration against self-discovery. Proclus introduces divine inspiration as the highest degree in a hierarchy descendingthrough discovery down to learning ( §242, 4 –11). This suggests some continuity between divine inspiration and self- discovery, a continuity also implied in the fact that the principles that are the objects of self-discovery are psychicimages ofhigher divine principles (below, p. 159) and thus are already themselves inspirations deriving f rom above.These innate principles are cited, in one unfortunately corrupt passage, as the reason why we need (or don'tneed, in another reading ofthe passage) a guide f or learning that transcends our nature. 400Whatever the true sense ofthe passage, it is Proclus' general view that we attain higher truths through the guidance and mediation ofgods anddemons. And the analogy between our reliance on superior guidance for such insights and the function of guides(teachers) in self-discovery again points to some continuity between divine inspiration and discovery. Thus thecombination ofrevelation with discovery in the ﬁgure ofPythagoras (or Plato) is no more a contradiction than that of discovery with learning.The theory ofdiscovery and learning in the Commentary on the Alcibiades also points to an answer to the question ofthe fallen souls' need for guidance and teaching. The degree of indispensability of such guidance must depend namely onthe degree to which the soul has fallen. Proclus leaves little doubt that souls at lower levels requireLEARNING, DISCOVERY, AND REVELATION 153 399In Alc. §§225, 4 –226, 7; 277, 10 –278, 13; 280, 2 –281, 14.</p><div id="pagenum"><p>400In Alc. §235, 15 –18; cf. O'Neill (1965), ad loc.</p></div><div id="pagenum"><p>guides and teachers ifthey are ever to achieve self -discovery. He interprets this action ofthe teacher on the pupil's soulwith the help ofAristotle's account oflearning and ofchange in general. The teacher represents the prior actuality ofknowledge, the moving cause actualizing the potential knowledge in the pupil's soul ( §228, 16 –20), or the perfection</p></div><p id="page">that brings the imperfect to perfection ( §235, 10 –12). Proclus warns us, however, against certain inferences that this account ofteaching might produce. The pupil's soul is not a tabula rasa, as in Aristotle, but possesses innately the knowledge that is learned, i.e. discovered, by the pupil ( §§277, 10 –18; 280, 19 –281, 7). Furthermore the teacher's action on the pupil is not to be seen as the sole agency responsible for the pupil's self-discovery ( §281, 10– 14): If, then, one should declare the matter accurately, souls are moved by external agencies, but determine ofthemselves their scienti ﬁc replies and so spontaneously demonstrate the truth ofPlato's statement that the soul knows everything including itselfand requires only an outside stimulus by means ofscienti ﬁc questions. (O'Neill transl.) The primary agent, then, ofthe pupil's progress in knowledge is himself . To illustrate this Proclus emphasizes theSocratic idea that it is Socrates' companion who ref utes himself , who brings upon himselfthe discovery ofthe f alsity ofhis opinions. The situation is quite different from that of irrational animals . . . ‘shepherded with a staff ’(Crit.109 b) . . . 〈and〉all those who await healing from outside causes, and wherever the leader leads there the led are led, beref t ofthe power ofruling and saving themselves; butthe human soul, on account ofits peculiar characteristic ofspontaneity and self -movement ( Phaedr. 245 c e) is of such a nature as to be active in its own regard, move itselfand provide itselfwith the good. ( §279, 18– 23; O'Neill transl.) To illustrate the particular kind ofaction whereby the teacher stimulates the pupil to discover himself , acting on thepupil in such a way as not to override the primary agency for which the pupil himself is responsible, Proclus refers to the way the gods and demons work upon us from within, not from without, and in communion with our own naturesas self-movers. 401 These considerations indicate that for Proclus the primary agency for the salvation of fallen souls is to be found intheir own selves. In this sense these souls can save themselves. At the same time, however,154PROCLUS: SOME PRELIMINARY ISSUES</p><div id="pagenum"><p>401§§281, 15 –20; 241, 14 –18; cf.

His recourse in other works to mathematics in relation to physics and metaphysics will be examined in the next two chapters. In these chapters I point also to continuities between Proclus' general account ofmathematics in theCommentary on Euclid and his use ofmathematics in his other works. This presupposes, however, an account ofthe philosophy ofmathematics ofthe Commentary on Euclid in particular as compared to the philosophies ofmathematics ofNicomachus and ofIamblichus, the subject ofthe f ollowing pages.What survives ofProclus' Commentary on Euclid may be divided into four parts: the ﬁrst prologue (on general mathematics); the second prologue (on geometry); the exegesis ofthe de ﬁnitions, postulates, and axioms at the head of Euclid's Elements I; and commentary on the theorems ofEuclid Book I. 403With the exception ofthe Elements ofTheology, no other work ofProclus has been so of ten translated and studied. In particular the ﬁrst prologue has attracted much interest and admiration, from Kepler, who inserted large extracts from it in his Harmonice Mundi, to Nicolai Hartmann, who used it as an important and relevant mathematical philosophy.404As the contents ofthe ﬁrst prologue have been summarized often enough,405I will not attempt another summary here. There remain, however, some basic issues connected with the ﬁrst prologue, the resolution ofwhich will require detailed analysis leading, as I hope to show, to some new insights into Proclus' assumptions in the ﬁrst prologue. 403Proclus certainly intended to go beyond Elements I in his commentary, although he may not have covered the whole; cf. Heiberg (1882), 164 –8; Morrow (1970), xxxi. Marinus' introduction to the Data can also be read as evidence ofthe study ofEuclid in Proclus' school. 404For an example ofunbridled enthusiasm f or the Commentary on Euclid cf. Steck (1945).</p><div id="pagenum"><p>405Hartmann's account (1909) can be used, allowance being made for his neo-Kantian approach.</p></div><div id="pagenum"><p>1.GeneralMathematics</p></div><p id="page">(I)Iamblichus'OnPythagoreanismIIIandProclus'OnEuclidProl.I It has long been known that Proclus' ﬁrst prologue substantially corresponds to the third book ofIamblichus' On Pythagoreanism, On General Mathematical Science.406The most natural inference from this would seem to be that Proclus used Iamblichus' text extensively in writing his prologue. Proclus after all was Syrianus' prize pupil; he had read withSyrianus Aristotle's Metaphysics (Marinus, Vita Procli, ch. 13); and it has been shown in Chapter 6 above that Syrianus, in his treatment ofthe Metaphysics, referred the student to Iamblichus' On Pythagoreanism as a source-book for true (i.e. Pythagorean) mathematics, summarizing in particular the contents ofBook III ofIamblichus' work.This inference has not, however, been favoured in what little discussion there is of the question. It has been felt ratherthat Proclus is using, independently ofIamblichus, an older source which Iamblichus also used. 407It has been claimed, in support of this position, that there are few verbal parallels between the texts of Proclus and of Iamblichus. The factthat this claim is manifestly untrue 408is not, however, enough to disprove the position it is supposed to support. More decisive appears to be the fact that Proclus' text is better organized, clearer, more consistent than Iamblichus'. Thegreater clarity, it is assumed, derives from the original source and therefore testi ﬁes to the independence ofProclus' text with respect to Iamblichus. The original source has even been identi ﬁed: Geminus, a mathematician ofGENERAL MATHEMATICS 157 406Cf. Merlan (1960), 8 ff.; Mueller (1987 b) for detailed comparisons. The correspondences between the chapters in Proclus (the ﬁrst number in each set) and in Iamblichus (the following number[s]) are: 1: 1 –2; 2: 3; 3 –4: 5; 5: 8; 7: 11 –12; 8: 15 –16; 9: 26; 11: 27; and compare 12: 7; 15: 11 and 34. (I use the chapter divisions introduced by Morrow in his translation ofProclus, and his translation much revised.) 407Proposed by Festa (without argument) in Iamblichus Comm., IX; intimated by Morrow (1970) in a note, 344 –5; and developed by van der Waerden (1980). Under the inﬂuence ofthis idea Mueller (1987 b) seems disinclined to conclude that Iamblichus is Proclus' source, although he does not seem to have good grounds against such a conclusion. 408Compare Procl. 6, 13 –15, Iambl. 13, 18 –21; Procl. 7, 20 –7, Iambl. 18, 26 –19, 6; Procl. 8, 25 –9, 2, Iambl. 20, 1 –5; Procl. 20, 25 –21, 4, Iambl. 55, 12 –16; Procl. 25, 1, Iambl. 57, 23; Procl. 25, 4 –5, Iambl. 57, 24 –5; Procl. 25, 23 –26, 3, Iambl. 79, 20 –4; Procl. 27, 27 –8, Iambl. 82, 11 –13; Procl. 32, 21 –3, Iambl. 7, 10 –13; Procl. 34, 20 –35, 5, Iambl.</p><div id="pagenum"><p>86, 26 –87, 5.</p></div><div id="pagenum"><p>theﬁrst century AD.

The implied denial that Proclus himselfis the source ofthe clarity and organization ofthechapters ofthe ﬁrst prologue ofhis Commentary on Euclid becomes implausible, however, ifone re ﬂects, for example, on the skill Proclus demonstrates in organizing the whole tradition ofPlatonic metaphysics in his Elements ofTheology. In comparison to this, the task ofproducing a clearer version ofIamblichus would have been a simple matter. In whatfollows I would like also to show that the thesis that Proclus' text comes in large part from Geminus, not fromIamblichus, entails anachronism. I shall then show how a chapter in Proclus' prologue (ch. 8) which is not claimed forGeminus —for it quotes Plotinus —represents a revision ofthe corresponding chapter in Iamblichus, and provides information on Proclus' modus operandi in composing his prologue, information that yields an explanation of various differences between Proclus' prologue and its Iamblichean source.The chapters claimed for Geminus in Proclus' prologue contain matter which cannot be dated without anachronism totheﬁrst century AD. For example the terminology ofthe ‘Chaldaean Oracles ’(second century AD) assimilated into a Neoplatonic context ( ﬁrst possible with Porphyry, then fully worked out by Iamblichus) can be found in ch. 2 (6, 9) in the reference to intelligible and ‘hidden ’principles (κϱυφίωνἀϱχω ̑ν).‘Hidden ’is a word derived by the later Neoplatonists from the ‘Chaldaean Oracles ’and used as a technical term for the highest intelligible causes.410 The‘Geminus ’chapters in Proclus also contain arguments and theories which constitute elaborations on ideas ﬁrst found in Iamblichus and (especially) in Syrianus. For example chapter 6 is devoted to arguing against the Aristoteliantheory that numbers are mere abstractions from material objects.

Proclus assembles arguments against Aristotle: how could mathematicals possess accuracy ifthey are derived from sensible objects? Where is the indivisibility in mathematicals to be found in sensibles where all isdivisible? How could immutable laws be derived from ever-changing sensibles? How could the general be prior indemonstration ifit is posterior to sensible particulars? Some ofthese arguments, expressed in the same interrogativeand accumulative form, appear already in Syrianus. 411This suggests that Proclus, in chapter 6 ofhis prologue, is strengthening the anti-Aristotelian position ofIamblichus with the help ofthe anti-Aristotelian arguments that he hadlearnt from Syrianus. Proclus also rejects in chapter 6 the Aristotelian idea that the soul is a tabula rasa (16, 8 –10). It is rather ‘a tablet that has always been inscribed and is always writing itselfand being written on by intellect. ’Proclus is assuming a theory of innate ideas (here in particular mathematicals) that derive from intellect and are unfolded by thesoul, a theory in which Aristotle's image ofthe soul as tablet ( γϱαμματει ̑ον,De an. 430 a 1) is given a Platonic turn. 412 The origin ofthis Platonic interpretation ofthe image ofthe De anima appears to be Iamblichus.413In the same chapter ﬁnally Proclus explains mathematicals as ‘projections ’(πϱοβολα ί) by the soul ofinnate intelligible principles.414This is again a theory ﬁrst clearly found in Syrianus and which appears to have its ultimate origin in Iamblichus (above, pp. 133–4). The place in the history ofphilosophy ofthe elaborate Platonic epistemology ofthe sixth chapter ofProclus' prologueis not then the ﬁrst century AD. It represents rather a developed stage ofthe anti-Aristotelian arguments and Platonic theories ﬁrst found in Syrianus and whose ultimate source of inspiration appears to be Iamblichus.

Thetechnical use ofChaldaean terminology in chapter 2 also shows that this chapter cannot simply be dated to the ﬁrst</p></div><p id="page">century AD, but indicates a date no earlier than Porphyry and very probably later. The hypothesis that much ofProclus' prologue is not based on Iamblichus' On Pythagoreanism III, but is to be assigned to an earlier source from which Iamblichus also was inspired, then (1) involves a number of anachronisms; (2) makesthe questionable assumption that Proclus is not himselfthe source ofthe greater clarity and order ofhis prologue; and(3) ignores the evidence ofSyrianus' opinion ofIamblichus' book and his recommendation ofit to students as amanual ofgeneral mathematics.As the more obvious and likely thesis that Proclus is using Iamblichus has not been examined in any detail, it isdesirable to compare the two authors from this viewpoint. Chapter 6 in Proclus comes after a chapter whichcorresponds to Iamblichus' text, but it does not itselfhave any equivalent in Iamblichus. The explanation ofthis hasalready been f ound: Proclus is elaborating in chapter 6, in the light ofSyrianus' teaching, a def ence ofIamblichus'rejection ofAristotelian abstraction in the chapter corresponding to Proclus' ﬁfth chapter. Explanations can also be found from this point-of-view for other additions and omissions in Proclus' prologue as compared to Iamblichus'text. 415I would like to examine in particular the case ofchapter 8, which has not been attributed to Geminus (although it has a corresponding section in Iamblichus, Comm. chs. 15 –16), since this case will reveal not only Proclus' way of proceeding vis-à-vis Iamblichus' text, but also introduce themes ofsom e importance to our larger interests.416 In comparing chapter 8 ofProclus' prologue with chapters 15– 16 ofIamblichus' On Pythagoreanism III, one notices ﬁrst a difference in the way sources are cited. In Iamblichus, for instance, we ﬁnd an undeclared allusion to Plotinus I 3, 3, 5–7(Comm. 55, 16– 19); in Proclus Plotinus is named and the Plotinian text is more carefully reproduced160 PROCLUS ON MATHEMATICS 415For example, nothing in Proclus' prologue corresponds to Iamblichus, Comm. ch. 4: an explanation ofthis is suggested by a scholium on Iamblichus' chapter: ‘Here the author introduces intelligible matter, as did the Pythagoreans before him, but Proclus does not agree with them ’(Comm. 100, 11 –13). At 8, 7 Proclus refers to ‘they 〈who〉call . . . ’;w h o ‘they’are is not at all clear from Proclus' text; however, Iamblichus, in the corresponding chapter (ch. 5), is summarizing Pythagorean doctrine.</p><div id="pagenum"><p>416Cf. Mueller's analysis (1987 b) ofthis chapter; he notes many ofthe f acts that I wish to mention.</p></div><div id="pagenum"><p>(21, 20– 4). On the supposition then that Proclus is using Iamblichus, we must conclude that Proclus recognized the</p></div><p id="page">Plotinian allusion and replaced it with a more faithful quotation. This is not at all unlikely: Proclus, after all, wrote aCommentary on Plotinus, a singular honour he reserved otherwise for the ancient philosophers and theologians. 417The same phenomenon can be observed in relation to the two authors' use ofPlato: Proclus quotes explicitly and morefully the texts of Plato implicitly used by Iamblichus 418and especially quotes texts from Plato which support and illustrate points made in Iamblichus.419Ifthen Proclus is indeed using Iamblichus, he is taking advantage ofhis immense learning to revise the text by naming, quoting more fully, and supplementing Iamblichus' undeclared sources. A closer comparative examination ofthe chapters in question in Proclus and Iamblichus strengthens the impressionthat Proclus is reworking, expanding, and clarifying the Iamblichean chapters. Both authors are concerned withshowing the importance ofmathematics f or theology (metaphysics), physics, politics, ethics, and the productive arts.The Iamblichean text has been summarized above (pp. 48, 50); I shall therefore con ﬁne myselfhere to noting some of the differences in Proclus' version.(a) Theology. After his undeclared allusion to Plotinus I 3, 3 Iamblichus concludes his section on this subject thus: ‘For all such things provide a major starting point for knowledge of 〈true〉beings and intelligibles ’(55, 21– 2). Having named and quoted Plotinus more fully, Proclus says: But that mathematics produces a contribution ofthe ﬁrst order to philosophy is clear from these points. But it is necessary to recall the individual 〈sciences〉and show that for theology mathematics prepares intellectual insight. For those truths about the gods that are dif ﬁcult for imperfect minds to discover and understand, these mathematical theories, through images, show to be trustworthy, evident, and irrefutable. 420For they show the images in numbers 〈i.e. arithmetic 〉ofthe characters ofwhat transcends being, revealing in discursive objects 〈i.e. geometry〉the powers ofintellectual ﬁgures. ThusGENERAL MATHEMATICS 161 417Cf. Westerink (1959). Of course Proclus' quotation of Plotinus is, by modern standards, loose. 418Compare Iambl. 55, 8 –12, with Procl. 20, 14 –26; Iambl. 57, 23 –58, 4, with Procl. 25, 3 –11. 419Compare Iambl. 55, 22 –56, 4, with Procl. 22, 17 –23, 11; Iambl. 56, 8 –13, with Procl. 24, 4 –20.</p><div id="pagenum"><p>420Cf.In Parm. 926, 16 –29.</p></div><div id="pagenum"><p>Plato explains to us many wonderful doctrines about the gods by means of mathematical forms, and the philosophyofthe Pythagoreans conceals its secret theological initiation using such veils. Such also is the entire Sacred Discourse,</p></div><p id="page">theBacchae ofPhilolaus, and the whole approach ofPythagoras' exegesis concerning the gods. (21, 25 –22, 16) With this Proclus ends his theological section. What is additional here in Proclus, it is clear, is a recapitulation ofthemajor point concerning the theological relevance ofmathematics as expounded by Iamblichus, with the addition ofsome references. The contrast implied in the latter between Plato's explanations and the secretiveness of Pythagoreaninitiation will not appear fortuitous if seen in connection with Proclus' distinction, found elsewhere (above, p. 148)between Plato's scienti ﬁc and the Pythagorean mystical approach. (b) Physics. Proclus lists most ofthe mathematical aspects ofphysics that occur in Iamblichus. However Iamblichus' ‘analogy that travels throughout everything in nature ’(55, 25) appears in more correct Platonic form in Proclus as the ‘analogy that binds together everything in the world, as Timaeus says somewhere . . . ’(22, 19 –21). A little later Proclus returns to the Timaeus to illustrate further the mathematical structuring of nature (23, 2 –11), whereas Iamblichus ends his section with a vague reference to ‘noble students ofnature who start f rom ﬁrst principles ’(56, 3 –4). Iamblichus' general reference, intended presumably to cover all sorts of ancient Pythagorean cosmology, is narrowed in Proclus soas to refer speci ﬁcally to Plato's Timaeus. (c) Politics and Ethics. The chief difference here is the use made of Plato in Proclus (23, 12 –24, 20) to illustrate and elaborate on points made more brie ﬂy in Iamblichus (56, 4 –13). (d) The Arts. Proclus' treatment oftheoretical arts (24, 23 –7) is much shorter than the section on this in Iamblichus (57, 9–22), but it makes Iamblichus' point more clearly and names the art Iamblichus is discussing, rhetoric. As for productive arts Iamblichus says merely (57, 22 –3):‘for productive arts 〈mathematics 〉has the rank ofparadigm’, whereas Proclus tells us: ‘for productive arts 〈mathematics 〉has the rank ofparadigm, generating bef ore in itselfthe principles and measures ofwhat are produced ’(24, 27 –25, 3). The all-too-briefstatement in Iamblichus becomes, with</p><div id="pagenum"><p>the further words in Proclus,162PROCLUS ON MATHEMATICS</p></div><div id="pagenum"><p>intelligible. Finally, on the subject ofthe practical arts, Proclus makes explicitly (25, 6 –7) the use implicitly made in</p></div><p id="page">Iamblichus (57, 26 –7) ofPlato's Philebus. The differences then between Proclus' chapter 8 and the corresponding part of Iamblichus' book can be accounted foras deriving from a desire on Proclus' part to clarify, explain, and document Iamblichus' text. The reasons for hissystematic introduction of passages from Plato will only become fully clear when his views on the relations betweenEuclid and Plato are examined. But already a distinctive tendency ofProclus that has been noticed elsewhere, namelyhis inclination to see Plato as more scienti ﬁc and the Pythagoreans as more mystical, has emerged in our comparisons. This result indicates that the differences in Proclus' text vis-à-vis Iamblichus' book are to be taken as expressions of Proclus' own pref erences. The study ofchapter 6 ofProclus' prologue, in the critique ofthe Geminus theory above,also shows that this chapter is to be understood as an elaboration ofIamblichus' text in the light ofwhat Proclus hadlearnt from Syrianus and developed further.We may conclude then that the supposition that Proclus used Iamblichus directly in composing his prologue yieldssatisfactory results in the case of the two chapters examined. From this viewpoint the similarities and differencesbetween the texts ofProclus and Iamblichus can be explained. Indeed some ofthe dif f erences re ﬂect ideas characteristic of Proclus and his teacher Syrianus. The revisions that these differences imply are also compatible withwhat is otherwise known ofProclus' skill as a philosophical writer. And his use ofIamblichus is made in any caseextremely likely through what has been shown concerning Syrianus' use and recommendation ofIamblichus' book. Onthe other hand the attribution ofsome chapters in Proclus corresponding to Iamblichus to an earlier source has beenshown to be untenable. 421 These conclusions deserve perhaps some emphasis. They indicateGENERAL MATHEMATICS 163 421I do not mean to deny that Proclus uses Geminus, merely that the chapters in Proclus corresponding to Iamblichus' work are taken, not from Iamblichus, b ut from Geminus. It is worth paying attention to the way in which Proclus introduces Geminus in the ﬁrst prologue: he is named as a proponent ofa division ofthe mathematical sciences otherthan that ofthe Pythagoreans (38, 1 –4), i.e. that ofNicomachus reproduced by Iamblichus ( Comm. ch. 7) and summarized by Proclus in the preceding pages (35, 19 ff.). The former division is alluded to by Iamblichus (95, 22 –4), but Proclus gives it a representative, Geminus. Again Proclus is clarifying and documenting</p><div id="pagenum"><p>Iamblichus' text. More generally on the liberties taken by Proclus with his sources, cf. Heath (1956), 133 –4.</p></div><div id="pagenum"><p>that Proclus had studied (at least) Book III ofIamblichus' On Pythagoreanism as carefully as Syrianus could have wished,</p></div><p id="page">and that Proclus' prologue can justi ﬁably be used as evidence for his attitude to Iamblichean Pythagoreanism as expressed in On Pythagoreanism III.422This makes the prologue a privileged source for the study of the evolution of Proclus' ideas in relation to those ofIamblichus. (II)Proclus'RevisionsofIamblichus The analysis above has indicated some ofthe ways in which Proclus altered the Iamblichean original: he documentedthe Iamblichean material by naming and quoting more accurate ly and fully from Iamblichus' sources, and clari ﬁed Iamblichus by simplifying some passages and expanding others. It can be seen that he accepts the essentials ofIamblichus' position on the importance ofmathematics: consequent on the intermediate position ofits objects in thestructure of reality, mathematics has a pivotal and far-reaching function, for it constitutes a paradigm for physics,ethics, politics, and the arts, and fore-shadows the objects of theology or metaphysics. The latter aspect expresses afunction of mathematics that Proclus documents (20, 14 ff.) with the text of Plato's Republic that Iamblichus (55, 8 ff.) silently uses, namely the function of leading the soul up to immaterial being. The one important doctrinal differencebetween Proclus and Iamblichus noted so far concerns the relation between mathematicals and the soul. Thesomewhat confusing situation in Iamblichus' text is not allowed to persist in Proclus: he ﬁrmly places mathematicals in the soul in the way Syrianus had done, that is, they are ‘projections ’by the soul ofintelligible principles innate in it. This clariﬁcation is ofsome importance, f or it determines, as I shall show later, the precise way in which mathematics may be used in physics and metaphysics. In what follows I shall supplement these results with comparisons between someother chapters ofProclus' prologue and Iamblichus' text.The effort observed above to name and quote more accurately and fully the sources Iamblichus incorporated in histext can be found elsewhere in Proclus' prologue. One might note for example his use of164PROCLUS ON MATHEMATICS 422InIn Parm. 758, 37 –8 Proclus appears to be using On Pythagoreanism IV (In Nic. 20, 14 –17) rather than Nicomachus Intro. arith. 15, 4–10. Proclus' references outside In Eucl. to Pythagorean mathematical ideas are often not precise and full enough to enable us to be sure that his source is Iamblichus rather than some other text , for example</p><div id="pagenum"><p>Nicomachus.</p></div><div id="pagenum"><p>Aristotle to this effect.423Especially noteworthy, however, is his use ofPlato: he not only supplements Iamblichus' text</p></div><p id="page">with quotations from Plato, but also substitutes the original Platonic passage for the (Pseudo-) Pythagorean plagiarycited as an authority by Iamblichus. Thus Iamblichus' ‘Archytas ’text in Comm. 12, 9–13, is replaced in Proclus (3, 14–16) by a reference to the original text of the Republic. The same happens elsewhere, 424most notably at 10, 15 ff., where Iamblichus' authorities, Brontinus and Archytas ( Comm. 34, 20 ff.), are not reproduced; Proclus refers rather to Plato's Republic (the source ofIamblichus' authorities), saying: ‘Let us examine after this what the criterion of mathematics might be and let us place before us Plato as guide to this revelation ( πϱοστησ ώμɛθακαὶτη ̑ςτούτου παϱαδόσɛωςἡγɛμόνατὸνΠλάτωνα)’(10, 16– 19). The language is Iamblichean.425But it also indicates, I believe, how Proclus' substitution ofPlatonic f or ‘Pythagorean ’texts is to be understood. It is not the case that Proclus suspected that Iamblichus' Pythagorean authorities were forged, copied from Plato. Proclus does not hesitate after all to citehimselfin his prologue the Sacred Discourse (above, p. 162). Rather he prefers Plato to Archytas, Brontinus, etc., as his guide to mathematics. 426This preference has to do primarily with the fact that he regards Euclid, as we shall see, as a faithful exponent of Plato, and this in turn makes Plato into the principal authority of his Commentary on Euclid. But we may suspect also that the distinction for Proclus between Plato's scienti ﬁc explanation and Pythagorean revelation (above, p. 162) is responsible at a deeper level for his choice of Plato's dialogues, rather than Iamblichus' Pythagoreans,as appropriate sources for the study of the nature and function of mathematics.Greater attention to Plato leads, however, to a problem which Proclus discusses in chapter 10 ofhis prologue, achapter coming between two chapters corresponding respectively to Iamblichus' Comm. chapters 26 and 27. The problem is the following: a major theme in Iamblichus' book (following Nicomachus) is the scienti ﬁccharacter of mathematics. Yet some members ofProclus' school (29,GENERAL MATHEMATICS 165 423Compare Proclus, 32, 23 –6 and 33, 21 –34, 1, with Iamblichus 84, 21 –5 (with the scholium ad loc., 103, 22) and 86, 2 –6. 424Compare also Iamblichus, Comm. 44, 10 ff. ( ‘Archytas ’) with Proclus 45, 15 ff.

In the Republic in particular Plato regards</p></div><p id="page">mathematics as defective since it does not examine the hypotheses from which it proceeds. Mathematics is thereforesubordinate to dialectic, a science that works back to an ultimate unhypothetical ﬁrst principle upon which all knowledge depends. In defending the scienti ﬁc character ofmathematics Proclus f ully recognizes its subordination to dialectic, which he calls ‘perfect ’and‘true’science (31, 19 –23). As receiving its ﬁrst principles from dialectic, mathematics is science in a secondary way. 427As iff eeling, however, that this might still not be suf ﬁcient to save the scienti ﬁc claims ofmathematics, Proclus attempts to def end f urther these claims. It is not the case that mathematics is ignorant ofits ﬁrst principles, but it receives these principles (as concepts innate in the soul) and demonstrates what follows from them. In this way mathematics elaborates a scienti ﬁc knowledge ofits matter (32, 5 –7 and 16 –18). Proclus' argument in fact gives to mathematics the characteristics of science as identi ﬁed by Aristotle. Plato's own approach in the Republic is hardly as positive. The distance separating Plato from Proclus' interpretation of Plato can be measured by the fact this interpretation arises from the attempt to reconcile Iamblichus' Nicomachean emphasis on thescienti ﬁc character ofmathematics with Plato's critique ofthe de ﬁciency ofmathematics, a reconciliation based on Aristotle's characterization ofscience. 2.Arithmeticand(Or?)Geometry Having introduced ‘general mathematics ’in Book III of On Pythagoreanism Iamblichus presented in the following books arithmetic (a version ofNicomachus pref aced by praise ofNicomachus as a true Pythagorean); the transposition ofarithmetic to physics, ethics, and theology; and the three other mathematical sciences, geometry, music, and astronomy.Proclus, however, moves directly from general mathematics in his ﬁrst prologue to an introduction to geometry in his second prologue (including praise ofEuclid as a Platonist) and to the commentary on Euclid's Elements. One may consequently wonder ifan introduction to arithmetic, perhaps a version ofNicomachus, once came af ter the ﬁrst prologue, or if, rather, the undeniable preference166PROCLUS ON MATHEMATICS</p><div id="pagenum"><p>42732, 3–5.

Hadot (1984), 123 –4 and (on earlier discussions ofthe problem) 77 –9.</p></div><div id="pagenum"><p>for geometry in physics and metaphysics that will be observed in the next two chapters led Proclus to use geometry forthe general purposes that arithmetic ful ﬁlled for Iamblichus. Might he also have preferred the Platonic scienti ﬁc work</p></div><p id="page">ofEuclid to the Pythagorean Nicomachus?It is clear ﬁrst ofall f rom the beginning ofProclus' second prologue (48, 1 –8) that the introduction to geometry is intended to follow directly on the introduction to general mathematics. This rules out therefore the possibility that an introduction to arithmetic once came between the ﬁrst and second prologues. 428On the other hand, it cannot be inferred that Euclid supplanted Nicomachus in Proclus' mind: Proclus knows and quotes Nicomachus;429ifhe did not write a commentary on Nicomachus, at least his pupil Ammonius lectured on Nicomachus in Alexandria;430and, most signiﬁcant ofall, Proclus considered himselfa reincarnation ofNicomachus.431This last fact suggests that Proclus valued Nicomachus no less than did Iamblichus. Finally one might note that Proclus does not show any signs ofquestioning the primacy ofarithmetic (as compared with geometry) in the hierarchy ofmathematical sciences. 432Some explanation of Proclus' preference for geometry must then be found that is compatible with these facts.I believe that the philosophical background to Proclus' particular interest in geometry (despite the admitted primacy ofarithmetic) is to be found in the theory that mathematicals are projections by the soul of innate intelligible principles. Itis particularly in geometry, according to Syrianus, that soul projects such innate principles into imagination because inits weakness soul is better able to grasp these principles in the extended form thus given them (above, p. 133). One caninfer from this that the inferiority of geometry vis-à-vis arithmetic, i.e. its recourse to extension, also makes it more accessible to theARITHMETIC AND (OR?) GEOMETRY 167 428Morrow mistranslates the last lines (47, 6 –8) ofthe ﬁrst prologue, which should read: ‘And so, dedicating this book to him, we will circumscribe ( πɛϱιγϱάψομɛν, i.e.ﬁnish, a mathematical pun) the study ofmathematical science 〈in general 〉.’Morrow's speculations ad loc. are consequently unfounded. 429Cf.In Tim.

In the ﬁgures ofgeometry the soul can better grasp its innate principles because these principles are</p></div><p id="page">expressed at a lower, more image-like, level. Proclus also makes this point about geometry ( In Eucl. 141, 4 –12): Thus soul, exercising her capacity to know, projects on the imagination, as on a mirror, the ideas ofthe ﬁgures; and the imagination, receiving in image-form these re ﬂections ofwhat is within 〈her〉, by their means affords the soul an opportunity to turn inward from the images and attend to herself. It is as if a man looking at himself in amirror and marvelling at the power ofnature and at his own appearance should wish to look upon himselfdirectly. . . . This text not only indicates that the spatial ﬁgures ofgeometry make accessible to soul the road to self -knowledge. 433It also treats geometry as performing the role assigned to mathematics in general in Plato's Republic : to mediate through images between material reality and the Forms. Arithmetic also deals with images, but these are expressed at a higherlevel; it has no recourse to extension in order to grasp its objects. And its principles possess greater simplicity, unity,than those ofgeometry. 434In this way arithmetic stands nearer to metaphysics, whereas geometry ﬁnds itselfnearer the middle point between metaphysics and the material world, thus more adapted to the capacities and needs oftheascending soul.There is another feature of geometry that also throws light on its position with respect to arithmetic in Proclus' mind.Plato assigns mathematics in the Republic to a faculty of the soul, διάνοια, which Neoplatonists in general took to mean discursive or more speci ﬁcally demonstrative (syllogistic) thought. Thus for Iamblichus the method characteristic of mathematics is syllogistic. Proclus also characterizes mathematical science as demonstrative in method and attempts toshow this in particular in the analysis ofEuclid's theorems. Whatever the merits ofthis enterprise, it was at least easierto apply to Euclid than to Nicomachus, whose arithmetical work is well known for the absence of demonstrations insupport ofits positions. For Proclus, however,168PROCLUS ON MATHEMATICS 433At 62, 11 –18, Proclus says: ‘In the middle region ofknowledge 〈geometry〉unfolds and develops discursive principles ( διανοητικοὶλόγοι); it investigates their variety, exhibiting their existences and properties, their similarities and differences, from which it comprehends within limited bounds the shapes in imagination of ﬁgures and refers back to the essential ( οὐσιώδη) being ofthe principles. ’Cf. also 52, 20 –7; 54, 27 –55, 18 (explication into the imagination because ofsoul's weakness, ἀσθενου ̑σα). Cf. Trouillard (1957), 338 –40.</p><div id="pagenum"><p>43459, 15 –20; cf. Breton (1969), 77– 8.</p></div><div id="pagenum"><p>this would not have represented a failing in Nicomachus, but would have to do, as I believe we are entitled to infer,with the more intermediate position ofgeometry, hence its more discursive, demonstrative character as compared withthe higher, more insight-like thought ofarithmetic.A fact might ﬁnally be mentioned which would have had considerable weight in Proclus' eyes, the signi ﬁcance ofwhich</p></div><p id="page">could be understood against the philosophical background just sketched, namely that in treating ofthe mediatory roleofmathematics in the Republic, Plato seems to have especially in mind geometry (510 b –511 b). Enough reasons have been found then that explain Proclus' preference for geometry in such a way as to reconcile itwith the ontological and epistemological superiority ofarithmetic. Through its greater ‘explication ’into images of higher hidden principles, through its more discursive demonstrative method, it is, among the mathematical sciences, aprivileged mediator between material and immaterial reality. This position does not rule out, ofcourse, the use ofthe‘images ’of arithmetic, but it does represent a shift in fulcrum: the role that Iamblichus gives arithmetic in On Pythagoreanism both as an introductory and as a pivotal science —Books V –VII are after all concerned with arithmetic reaching down into physics and ethics and up into metaphysics —is assigned in Proclus rather to geometry. One might also speak ofa change f rom Iamblichus' Pythagoreanizing emphasis on arithmetic to a Platonizing stress on geometry.We have found then another important point on which Proclus diverged from Iamblichus' Pythagorean programme.The elements for this shift from arithmetic to geometry are indeed to be found already in Iamblichus' subordination ofgeometry to arithmetic. Even more suggestive is Syrianus' account ofgeometricals as projections in the imagination bythe soul due to its weakness. But there is little sign in Syrianus ofthe systematic recourse to geometry in philosophywhich I think must be regarded as Proclus' own contribution. 435ARITHMETIC AND (OR?)

The dependence ofhis ﬁrst prologue on Iamblichus' On Pythagoreanism III leads to the question whether Proclus, for his second prologue, might also have used Iamblichus, namely the (lost) introduction to geometry that constituted On Pythagoreanism VIII. The signs are, however, that this is not the case. In particular, there are passages in the second prologue that repeat Proclus' revisions ofIamblichus in the ﬁrst prologue, applying them now to the case ofgeometry. 436To some extent then Proclus used his ﬁrst prologue in the composition ofhis second prologue. This procedure conf orms to what has been established concerning Proclus' attitude to geometry, for it assumes that the philosophical functions assigned by Iamblichus togeneral mathematics can be instantiated in particular by geometry. Another aspect ofthe composition ofthe secondprologue might also be noted brie ﬂy here: the effort to document (the history of geometry in particular) that already characterizes the ﬁrst prologue. (II)EuclidasPlatonist There are a number ofgood philosophical reasons, as we have seen, f or ﬁrst studying geometry rather than arithmetic in one's progress through mathematics to metaphysics. But it remains for Proclus to explain his choice of Euclid'sElements as a manual ofgeometry, rather than, f or example, the ‘Pythagorean ’geometry ofIamblichus' On Pythagoreanism VIII. From Proclus' text it appears that Euclid had been discussed by Syrianus, possibly by Plutarch of Athens, and by Porphyry. 437But what did Proclus himselfsee in Euclid that recommended him as a guide to geometry? Proclus claims that Euclid is a Platonist by philosophical confession (68, 20 –1); that the goal ofthe Elements is the construction ofthe geometrical ﬁgures ofPlato's Timaeus (68, 21– 3; 384, 2 –4); and that Euclid's theorems, starting from hypotheses (given by a higher170PROCLUS ON MATHEMATICS 436Compare 62, 4 –7, with 22, 6 –9, and the references above, n. 9, and below, p. 172.</p><div id="pagenum"><p>437In Eucl. 123, 19 –20; 125, 16; 297, 4 –5; 315, 15 –316, 1; 352, 13 –15; cf.

I believe consequently that Proclus' choice ofEuclid is to be understood in relation to his pref erence f or Plato. In particular, his tendency to see Plato asmore ‘scienti ﬁc’than the Pythagoreans is connected to his preference of Euclid's manual to a ‘Pythagorean ’geometry. Evidence in support ofthis can be f ound much later in the commentary (426, 6 –14) where Proclus contrasts the Pythagoreans who ﬁrst understood a particular Euclidean theorem with Euclid's demonstration: Ifwe listen to those who like to record antiquities, we shall ﬁnd them attributing this theorem to Pythagoras. . . . For my part, though I admire those who ﬁrst grasped this theorem, I admire more the author ofthe Elements, not only for the very lucid demonstration by which he secured it, but also because in the sixth book he laid hold of atheorem even more general than this and secured it by irrefutable scienti ﬁc arguments. The theme ofthe scienti ﬁc, demonstrative, irrefutable character of Euclid's work is prominent in Proclus' praise of Euclid in the second prologue (69, 1 –2 and 12 –13; 70, 16 –18). Such qualities had also been attributed by Iamblichus to Nicomachus in his introduction to Nicomachean arithmetic ( On Pythagoreanism IV)—with much less justi ﬁcation. At any rate Proclus' choice ofEuclid's Elements as a manual ofgeometry, we may conclude, has to do with Euclid's supposed Platonism and the more scienti ﬁc quality ofthis Platonic geometry as compared with the geometry ofthe ancient Pythagoreans.Proclus ofcourse ﬁnds other qualities in Euclid that recommend his Elements as a manual. In particular Euclid demonstrates the suitable pedagogical virtues: clarity, concision, coherence, an absence ofsuper ﬂuity, an appropriate level ofgenerality (73, 15– 74, 18). Such virtues had also been found by Iamblichus in Nicomachus. (III)TheMethodofGeometry This subject has already been touched on in the preceding pages. However, there is more to geometrical method thanits (Aristotelian) syllogistic derivation ofconclusions f rom ﬁrst principles and the (Platonic) dependence ofsuch principles on the higher science ofGEOMETRY 171</p><div id="pagenum"><p>438Cf. above, p. 166; In Eucl. 75, 5–14; Breton (1969), 39 ff., 124.</p></div><div id="pagenum"><p>dialectic. In particular, Proclus, in the second prologue, attributes to geometry not only demonstration but alsodeﬁnition, division, and analysis, the last two elements re ﬂecting a progression away from and a return to ﬁrst</p></div><p id="page">principles (69, 9 –19). These four elements of method in Proclus have often been described, 439and I shall con ﬁne myselfhere to adding a f ew points.It might be observed that the four elements of geometrical method are found before in the ﬁrst prologue, where they are treated as the elements ofgeneral mathematics (43, 2 –10). Here Proclus is taking his cue from Iamblichus ( Comm. 65, 1–26; 89, 16 –27). From what has been determined above in section (i) we can see that Proclus has taken the four elements ofmathematical method he f ound in Iamblichus and applied them in his second prologue to geometry.The comparison between the second and ﬁrst prologues and the Iamblichean source yields another, more important result. Iamblichus discusses de ﬁnition, division, demonstration, and analysis as features of mathematical method in the context ofclaiming their independence and superiority vis-à-vis comparable features of dialectical, i.e. logical method (Comm. 89, 16 ff.). In Proclus' ﬁrst prologue, however, (42, 9 –21) the dependence ofsuch f eatures in mathematical method on analogous f eatures ofa higher dialectic, namely that ofPlato's Republic is stressed. 440The same point is indicated in the application to geometry in the second prologue (69, 13– 19). Iamblichus recognizes ofcourse the superiority ofPlato's dialectic and ﬁnds in it the dividing and unifying features also constitutive of mathematical method, but he does not, at least in On Pythagoreanism III, draw the conclusion that the four components of mathematical method are modelled on those ofPlatonic dialectic.441The Nicomachean emphasis on mathematics tends to predominate in Iamblichus' book, and the subordination in terms ofmethod to Platonic dialectic is not worked outclearly. On the other hand Proclus' greater attention to Plato and the Republic produces a stronger and clearer position on the subordination ofmathematics to Platonic dialectic and leads to his claim in the ﬁrst172 PROCLUS ON MATHEMATICS 439Cf. Hartmann (1909); Breton (1969), 123 ff. 440In the scholia to Iamblichus' Comm. the difference between dialectic as logic and as the supreme science of Plato's Rep.is noted (101, 34 –102, 2); cf. Proclus, Theol. Plat. I 39, 7–21, and already Plotinus I 3, 4 –5. 441Comm. 46, 3–13; cf. Mueller (1987 b). In their note (142) to Proclus, Theol. Plat.

This is of some consequence, for it implies aclearer view ofthe precise position ofmathematics in philosophy. In particular it calls attention to a science higher thanmathematics which pre ﬁgures at a superior, more original level, the discursive, demonstrative character of</p></div><p id="page">mathematics. The consequences ofthese clari ﬁcations ofIamblichus' position in On Pythagoreanism III will emerge when the relations between mathematics and metaphysics are examined below in Chapter 10. (IV)TheTranspositionofGeometry Given Proclus' general view ofgeometry's place in relation to mathematics and to philosophy and the correspondingway in which the second prologue ofhis Commentary echoes the ﬁrst, it is only to be expected that geometry will be shown in the second prologue (ch. 3) to carry out those functions of extra-mathematical transposition that areattributed (following Iamblichus) in the ﬁrst prologue to general mathematics. Thus geometry reaches (as did general mathematics in the ﬁrst prologue) up to true and divine being, teaching us through images the special properties ( ἰδιότητας) ofthe divine orders and the powers ofthe intellectual Forms. . . . Here it shows us what ﬁgures are appropriate to the gods, which ones belong to primary beings . . . (62, 5–10) At the intermediate level it unfolds in the imagination discursive principles. 442Below this level it examines nature, that is, the species ofelementary perceptible bodies and the powers associated with them, andexplains how their causes are contained in advance in its own ideas. It contains images ofall intelligible kinds andparadigms ofsensible ones; but the f orms ofdiscursive reason constitute its essence, and through this middleregion it ranges upwards and downwards to everything. . . . Always philosophizing about being in the manner ofg e o m e t r y ,...i th a si m a g e so fa l lt h ev i r t u e s —intellectual, psychic, and physical —and presents in due order all the forms of political constitution, showing from its own nature the variety of the changes they undergo. (62, 19 –63, 5) The physical, ethical, and metaphysical applications ofarithmetic had been worked out by Iamblichus in Books V –VII ofOn Pythagoreanism.GEOMETRY 173</p><div id="pagenum"><p>44262, 11 –18, quoted above, n. 31.</p></div><div id="pagenum"><p>It will be Proclus' concern, however, in the following commentary to bring out these applications in the case ofgeometry.

But whatever matters contain moresubstantial science and contribute to philosophy as a whole, these we shall make it our chiefconcern to mention,emulating the Pythagoreans whose byword and proverb was ‘aﬁgure and a stepping-stone, not a ﬁgure, and three obols ’. By this they meant that we must cultivate that science ofgeometry which with each theorem lays the basis for a step upward and draws the soul to the higher world. . . . 443 Whatever differences then there might be between Proclus and Iamblichus on the preferability of arithmetic orgeometry, Pythagorean ofPlatonic texts, the purpose ofProclus' Commentary on Euclid is essentially that ofIamblichus' On Pythagoreanism, to use mathematical science as a bridge, as a paradigmatic key to physics and ethics, as a fore- shadowing ofand initiation to metaphysics. Proclus even presents the overall purpose ofhis Commentary, as described in the above passage, as ‘Pythagorean ’. Proclus carries out the ‘Pythagorean ’approach to geometry most fully in his commentary on Euclid's de ﬁnitions. The deﬁnitions are regarded as treating ofthe objects ofgeometry in their ontological order, i.e. in their real progression from point (def. 1) through line (defs. 2 –4) to surface (defs. 5 –7) which includes angles (defs. 8 –12) and ﬁgures in general (defs. 13 –14) and in their progression from circular (defs. 15 –17) to rectilinear ﬁgures (defs. 20 –34). For the deﬁnitions Proclus provides a mathematical exegesis combined with extrapolations ofgeometrical concepts on to the objects oflower and higher philosophical sciences, 444much in the way that Nicomachus had done long before in his Theologoumena. However Proclus' text re ﬂects not only his clear and systematic mind but also advances in physics and especially metaphysics since the time ofIamblichus and Syrianus. His174PROCLUS ON MATHEMATICS 44384, 11 –20 (cf. 174, 17 –21). The Pythagorean saying is quoted in the scholia to Iamblichus, Comm. 101, 17 –18, and is interpreted by Iamblichus ( Pr.125, 1 –8) in the same way. 444Cf. e.g. 97, 18 ff. (def. 2: Πυθαγο ϱικωτέϱων); 128, 26 ff. (def. 9); 131, 21 ff. (defs. 10 –12:οἱΠυθαγο ϱικοί); 137, 8 –142, 9 (def. 14: Πυθαγ όϱɛιοɛ); 166, 14 ff. (defs. 24 –9: Πυθαγ όϱɛιοι); 173, 2 ff.

In preparation for this it may be useful to add a few more remarks about Proclus'transpositions ofgeometry in his Commentary on Euclid. In his ‘Pythagorean ’demonstration ofthe importance of geometrical truths for physics Proclus not only refers to the Pythagoreans, but also illustrates his point by quotingfrom Plato's Timaeus. And in applying geometry to metaphysics he makes use ofPlato's Parmenides. The latter practice is ofparticular interest, since the Parmenides is not seen as a mathematical fore-shadowing of metaphysics, but rather as expounding a higher science whose principles are ofnormative relevance to mathematics: Because the line is second 〈to the point 〉and owes its existence to the ﬁrst change from the simple (undivided), the Pythagorean doctrine properly calls it dyadic. But that the point is posterior to the monad and the line to thedyad and the surface to the triad is shown by Parmenides ( Parm. 137 c) when he denies ﬁrst plurality, and then wholeness of the One; if plurality comes before wholeness, then number comes before the continuous, the dyadbefore the line, and the monad before the point. 446 Thus mathematics is inspired not only in its methods, but also in its doctrines by a higher science, Platonic dialectic,and the objects ofthat higher science. The paradigmatic role ofthis dialectic with regard to mathematics is not,however, worked out in any detail in the Commentary on Euclid. 447 4.Conclusions The argument showing in the ﬁrst part ofthis chapter that Proclus based the ﬁrst prologue ofhis Commentary on Euclid largely on Iamblichus' On Pythagoreanism III not only is signi ﬁcant as yielding evidence ofProclus' f amiliarity with Iamblichus' Pythagoreanizing programme, but also makes it possible to identify in a speci ﬁc way theGEOMETRY 175 445Beierwaltes (1961), 120 ff.; (1979), 165 –239; cf.

Proclus fully accepts the pivotal role of mathematics inphilosophy, its paradigmatic function in physics and ethics, its anticipatory and introductory function in metaphysics.But his adoption ofSyrianus' view ofmathematics as ‘projections ’by the soul from innate principles results in a</p></div><p id="page">clariﬁcation in this direction ofthe unclear relation between soul and mathematicals in the Iamblichean text: this will turn out later to be ofsome importance f or determining the particular way in which mathematical truths can beapplied ‘downwards ’and‘upwards ’. In revising, clarifying, and documenting Iamblichus, Proclus largely replaces the Pythagorean authorities in Iamblichus with texts taken from Plato. This appears to relate not only to Proclus' view ofEuclid's Elements as a manual ofPlatonic geometry, but also to his tendency to regard Plato as more ‘scienti ﬁc’than the Pythagoreans. The comparison between Proclus and Iamblichus also indicates that Proclus chose geometry to standfor mathematics much in the way that arithmetic does in Iamblichus. This appears to derive from the view thatgeometry plays more the role ofmathematical intermediary than does arithmetic, f or its extended ﬁgures make innate principles more accessible to the fallen soul and its more pronounced demonstrative character coincides better with thediscursive capacity ofsuch a soul. At the same time the concentration on the ‘Platonic ’background ofEuclidean geometry leads to a greater emphasis in Proclus than is to be found in Iamblichus' text on the subordination ofmathematics to a higher, ‘true’science, Platonic dialectic, which inspires, and can even be used to determine, methods</p><div id="pagenum"><p>and principles in mathematics.176PROCLUS ON MATHEMATICS</p></div><div id="pagenum"><p>9MathematicsandPhysicsinProclus</p></div><p id="page">In Book V of On Pythagoreanism Iamblichus attempted to show in detail the paradigmatic function of mathematics in understanding the material world; the result was an unusual work on ‘arithmetical physics ’. According to the reconstruction ofthe book that I have proposed in Chapter 3, this arithmetical physics consisted in a mathematizedrevision ofAristotle's Physics in which the principles ofphysical explanation presented in the ﬁrst part ofthe Physics were shown to be exempli ﬁed in the properties ofvarious sorts ofnumber: numbers exhibit the f ormal, ef ﬁcient, and material causality at work in the immanent organizing principles ofnature, ‘physical numbers ’. While following the pattern ofphysical explanation provided by the early books ofAristotle's Physics Iamblichus did not ignore Aristotle's criticisms ofthe Pythagoreans, but attempted to meet such criticisms and improve Aristotelian physics so as to turn itinto a true ‘Pythagorean ’science ofnature. Proclus also wrote works in mathematical physics, the Elements ofPhysics and his Commentary on the Timaeus. In this chapter I shall discuss these two works with a view to determining what they show about the function of mathematicsin physics. In this way inferences may be made concerning the philosophical standpoint of Proclus' physics vis-à-vis Iamblichean Pythagoreanism. At the same time the very bulk ofthe material in Proclus, as compared to thef ragmentary remains ofIamblichus, will permit ofa better view ofprecisely what a later Neoplatonic mathematicalphysics consists of, at least in the form it takes in Proclus. 1.Aristotle'sPhysicsGeometricized The geometrical form given to Aristotle's physics in the Elements ofPhysics is so prominent as to seem almost exaggerated. Each ofthe two books ofthis short work is headed by a list ofde ﬁnitions in the Euclidean manner. These</p><div id="pagenum"><p>are followed by a series of propositions with</p></div><div id="pagenum"><p>demonstrations and corollaries often using geometrical principles. Euclidean style is adopted even in the language:imperatives, postulations, the QED formula.</p></div><p id="page">448The imposition ofgeometrical f orm is all the more appropriate in that the Aristotelian texts used already incorporate much recourse to geometrical argument. However Proclus showsingenuity in reworking Aristotle: Aristotle's points are organized into a strict sequence, often clari ﬁed and supplemented. In particular strict demonstrative (i.e. syllogistic) form is insisted on in the recasting of Aristotle'sarguments in support ofhis points. Proclus' rewriting ofAristotle here could be compared in its skill to his rewriting ofIamblichus in the ﬁrst prologue ofhis Commentary on Euclid. However the approach ofthe ﬁrst prologue is somewhat different: it is a broad and not too demanding introduction to mathematics, whereas the Elements ofPhysics imposes itselfas a demonstration or exercise in scienti ﬁc rigour. Indeed the purpose Proclus seems to have had in geometricizing Aristotle's physics was to make Aristotle's arguments stronger from the point-of-view of scienti ﬁc method. Geometry's contribution to physics is then methodological, and this method is essentially that ofsyllogisticargument.The tendency to identify syllogistic method with the method of geometry has already been observed in Proclus'Commentary on Euclid, as has been a preference for geometry among the mathematical sciences in transpositions into physics and metaphysics. Ifa comparison in these respects between Iamblichus' arithmetical version ofAristotelianphysics and Proclus' geometrical version ofthe same can serve to indicate how Proclus is inspired by, and yet movesaway from the precedent set by Iamblichus, it should also be noted that Proclus' Elements ofPhysics is not to be considered simply as a geometrical substitute for Iamblichus' arithmetical physics. Iamblichus' book covers theprinciples ofphysical explanation presented in the ﬁrstpart ofAristotle's Physics, whereas Proclus' work is based on the second halfofthe Physics, in particular Books VI and VIII supplemented by passages from De Caelo I. Proclus deals, not with the question of physical explanation, but with motion and change with particular reference to the inference tothe‘unmoved mover ’that the analysis ofmotion produces. Aristotle's argument in Physics VIII that motion in the world ultimately presupposes an unmoved cause appears to be Proclus' chiefinterest in the Elements ofPhysics ; the more general178MATHEMATICS AND PHYSICS IN PROCLUS</p><div id="pagenum"><p>448Cf. e.g. El. phys. 2, 17; 4, 12, 15, 20 –1, 25; 10, 15; 12, 4.</p></div><div id="pagenum"><p>propositions he ﬁrst extracts from Physics VI function as the groundwork logically presupposed by this argument. And</p></div><p id="page">in reformulating Aristotle's argument Proclus reveals his Platonic point-of-view in stressing at the end the immaterialnature that Aristotle's unmoved mover must have. 449 The practice oftaking de ﬁnitions, axioms, and demonstrations from Aristotle's physics for purposes which are Platonic in inspiration is not con ﬁned to the Elements ofPhysics. It may be found elsewhere in Proclus.450However, the value ofAristotle's physics was limited. Like Iamblichus and Syrianus, Proclus considered Aristotle's writings in physicsto be def ective imitations, produced in a spirit ofrivalry, ofPlatonic physics as revealed in particular in the Timaeus. 451A measure ofAristotle's heretical inclinations is to be f ound in the criticisms he makes ofthe Timaeus, and Proclus devoted a work (since lost) to responding to these criticisms. The Timaeus was then a far better source for true physics. Proclus produced early in his life a vast Commentary on the Timaeus ofwhich (about) the ﬁrst halfsurvives.452In the rest ofthis chapter 1 I shall discuss the conception ofPythagorean mathematical physics that Proclus develops in thisCommentary in connection with the intrepretation ofthe physics ofthe Timaeus. 2.Plato'sTimaeusas ‘Pythagorean ’Physics At the beginning ofhis Commentary Proclus announces his view that Plato's Timaeus is inspired by a work ofthe Pythagorean Timaeus ofLocri: And indeed the book by the Pythagorean Timaeus On Nature, written in a Pythagorean manner, 〈is that〉 ‘starting from which Plato embarked on writing the Timaeus ’, according to 〈Timon〉the writer of sylloi.We have placed this book at the head ofour commentary so that we will be able to see what Plato's Timaeus says that agrees〈with the Pythagorean 〉, what Plato adds, where there is disagreement. (I 1, 8 –16; cf. 7, 18 –21)PLATO'S TIMAEUS AS sPYTHAGOREANy PHYSICS 179 449El. phys. 58, 20 –7 (compare Aristotle, Phys.267 b 19 –26). Dodds, in his edition ofthe El. theol. (xviii, 201, 250), has disposed ofRitzenf eld's claim in his edition ofthe El. phys. that the work was written early in Proclus' career while studying Aristotle and before reading Plato and becoming a Platonist. 450Cf.In Tim. II 93, 30 –94, 15 (compare El. phys. 30, 10 –11; 34, 3); In Remp. II 9, 26. 451In Tim. I 6, 21 ff.; 237, 17 ff.; III 323, 31 ff.; cf. I 7, 15 –16; 295, 26 –7.</p><div id="pagenum"><p>452Cf. Festugière (1966 –8), V 239 –48.</p></div><div id="pagenum"><p>There is some indication in the manuscript tradition that the supposed Pythagorean original was indeed placed beforeProclus' Commentary.</p></div><p id="page">453Furthermore it will be noticed that Proclus' project —to comment on his text by measuring it against its Pythagorean source —is the same as that which Iamblichus had adopted before in commenting on Aristotle's Categories, when he had measured Aristotle against the putative original, (pseudo-)Archytas. Indeed it is likely enough that Iamblichus had used the same approach in his (lost) Commentary on the Timaeus, comparing Plato with Timaeus ofLocri, and that Proclus here is f ollowing his lead.454 There are some differences, however, between the way Proclus uses Timaeus of Locri in his Commentary on the Timaeus and Iamblichus' use of(pseudo-)Archytas in his Commentary on the Categories. Iamblichus keeps Archytas very much in mind, quotes him frequently, and vigorously compares Aristotle (to his disadvantage) to Archytas. On the other handProclus refers to Timaeus of Locri comparatively little in his Commentary on the Timaeus, and then in a way that assumes or argues for agreement between Timaeus and Plato. 455May we therefore conclude that Proclus gradually abandoned or forgot the Iamblichean approach to which he subscribed at the beginning of his work?456Could this have to do with the retreat ofPythagoreans in f avour ofPlato that has already been observed in Proclus?Appealing as these possibilities may be, I believe that they are open to some serious objections. First ofall the range oftext spanned by Proclus' references to Timaeus of Locri (see note 8) shows that Proclus did not abandon or forgethim. Then it must be stressed that for Iamblichus (and Proclus) Aristotle was something of a deviant requiring activeand constant correction, whereas the harmonious relations between a true Pythagorean and Plato would scarcely callfor such critical vigilance. Thus the difference in exegetical practice resulting from the different relationships betweenArchytas and Aristotle and between Timaeus ofLocri and Plato might suf ﬁce to account for the less prominent role of Timaeus ofLocri in Proclus' Commentary as compared to that ofArchytas in Iamblichus' Commentary on the Categories. Thirdly, although Proclus does indeed distinguish180MATHEMATICS AND PHYSICS IN PROCLUS 453Cf. Marg (1972), 2. 454So Harder (1926), xvi –xvii; cf. above, pp. 96, 99. Marg concedes that his doubts on this are a little exaggerated, (1972), 92. 455In Tim. II 79, 4 –11; 101, 9 –14; 188, 9 –190, 11; III 138, 3 –11.</p><div id="pagenum"><p>456Cf.

Indeed Plato alone, as compared to other physicists (one thinks ofAristotle), f ollowed Pythagorean methods and doctrines.458 I believe consequently that the Commentary on the Timaeus shows a tendency to Pythagoreanize in the manner of Iamblichus and Syrianus, a tendency less pronounced in Proclus' other works. A telling sign ofthis can be f ound in thefact that the Commentary makes use ofa good number ofspeci ﬁc‘Pythagorean ’authorities and texts, whereas the usual practice in Proclus' other works is to refer on occasion and in a vague way to ‘the Pythagoreans ’(above, ch. 7 n. 26). The reason for the particular Pythagorean emphasis of the Commentary on the Timaeus can be surmised: we know that it was one ofProclus' ﬁrst major works, completed probably shortly after Syrianus' death, and it is a fair guess that it reﬂects in some respects, especially in its earlier parts, the in ﬂuence ofSyrianus. 459 3.TheGeometricalMethodofPlato'sPhysics It remains to determine the extent to which Proclus' programmatic claims for the Pythagorean character of Plato'sTimaeus affect the actual interpretation of physics to be found in his Commentary. To what extent, in particular, does Proclus develop the Timaeus into a work ofmathematical physics? In what sense does Proclus show the physics of Plato's dialogue to be mathematical? Plato himselfbrings in so much mathematics that it might at ﬁrst appear impossible for a commentator not to ﬁnd mathematical physics in the dialogue. Yet Plato's text presents more than enough ambiguities and dif ﬁculties toPLATO'S TIMAEUS AS sPYTHAGOREANy PHYSICS 181 457In Tim. I 129, 31 –2; 223, 5 –6; III 168, 7 –9; cf.

I1 ,2 5 –6; 2, 29 –3, 4; 33, 7 –11; 262, 10 –11; 267, 1 –2. 459Thus, for example, the ontological subordination of the ﬁgures ofthe dialogue appears to be Syrianus' idea (Proclus, In Tim. I 20, 27 ff.: Timaeus as the ‘monad ’ofthe</p><div id="pagenum"><p>group). Cf. Sheppard (1980), 34 –8.</p></div><div id="pagenum"><p>leave open for the interpreter a wide range of possible approaches and options.In the ﬁrst section ofthis chapter the chiefcontribution ofmathematics to physical argument in the Elements ofPhysics</p></div><p id="page">was found to be methodological: Aristotle's text was given the strict demonstrative form Proclus assumed to becharacteristic ofgeometric method. In his Commentary on the Timaeus Proclus describes the method ofPlato's Timaeus also as ‘geometrical ’, which is to say rigorously syllogistic in form. However, Timaeus' discourse is preceded in the dialogue by Critias' recounting ofthe myth ofAtlantis. This f ollows, according to Proclus, the Pythagorean practice offore-shadowing with images the scienti ﬁc account that begins with Timaeus' discourse. 460Timaeus then proposes ﬁve hypotheses or axioms, from which he derives physical conclusions of which the ﬁrst three are: that the world is constituted; by a demiurge; who made use of an eternal paradigm. In the following commentary Proclus frequentlyemphasizes the geometric method that he believes characterizes Timaeus' speech. As this motifin Proclus' Commentary has been fully examined elsewhere, 461it will be suf ﬁcient merely to note that the assimilation ofscienti ﬁc (demonstrative) to geometric method is characteristic ofProclus not only here and in the Elements ofPhysics but also, as we will see, in his metaphysical (theological) works, and that this assimilation is related to the attitude to geometryexpressed in his Commentary on Euclid. 4.IsPhysicsaScience? Mathematics in the form of geometry lends much more to physics than merely its syllogistic method. It also helps toresolve for Proclus a major problem posed by the physics of Plato's Timaeus, namely that concerning the questionable scienti ﬁc status ofphysics. The problem is introduced by Timaeus towards the beginning ofhis discourse ( Tim.29 b c): And in speaking ofthe copy 〈i.e. the world 〉and the original 〈i.e. the Forms 〉we may assume that words are akin to the matter which they describe; when they relate to the lasting and permanent and intelligible, they ought tobe lasting182 MATHEMATICS AND PHYSICS IN PROCLUS 460In Tim.

But when they express</p></div><p id="page">only the copy or likeness and not the eternal things themselves, they need only be likely and analogous to the realwords. As being is to becoming, so is truth to belief. (Transl. Jowett) This passage casts a shadow over the cosmology that follows, for it suggests that true and abiding, i.e. scienti ﬁc, statements can be made only ofthe Forms and that all that can be claimed f or what is said about the physical world islikelihood, not truth. In this sense then there can be no science ofnature, strictly speaking, nor can Timaeus' accountbe taken to be such a science. The interpreter ofPlato seems f aced with a choice between ignoring or glossing over thispassage, so as to be able to regard the cosmology ofthe Timaeus as scienti ﬁc; 462abandoning the hope of ﬁnding physical science in the Timaeus ; or determining the way in which an account ofnature, in being ‘likely ’, attains a certain degree of truth and to this extent approaches, without being, science.Proclus resolves the problem along the lines ofthe third option, using a key provided by the structure ofgeometricaldemonstrations. Such demonstrations rest on axioms and hypotheses, which can thus be regarded as the principles or‘causes ’from which conclusions in geometry result or are derived. In physics the world and its contents are the results (‘conclusions ’) to be explained, to be related back, that is, to their constitutive ﬁrst principles. But for a Platonist such principles (both ofthe world and ofscienti ﬁc discourse) must be transcendent, immaterial, and unchanging. Platonic physics must then begin and be derived from meta-physical causes. But this also means that it is based on immaterialunchanging truths and in this way is related to science. Thus discourse about the world can be true to the extent that itrefers to transcendent principles. And it is the relation between axioms/hypotheses and conclusions in geometry thatserves to bring out the scienti ﬁc basis ofphysics. 463 An example will help to illustrate and specify further the extent of the scienti ﬁc claims ofphysics. Propositions held to be universally true occur in astronomy. They are true in this way, however, only to the extent that they express theuniversal mathematical laws to which the heavens are subject. In so far as they apply to particular heavenlyIS PHYSICS A SCIENCE? 183 462In the strong Greek sense ofscience ofcourse.

Thus ifthe astronomical law that ‘the celestial circles bisect each other ’is</p></div><p id="page">universally true, this has to do with the geometrical principles at issue, for in the case of particular celestial bodies there can be no point ofbisection in the geometrical sense required by the law: a physical point ofbisection is divisible,therefore defective, as compared to the indivisibility of the geometrical point. 464The de ﬁciency ofsuch laws when applied to physical bodies relates not only, however, to the difference in ontological character between these bodies andthe immaterial principles from which the laws derive. It is also due to the fact that we know of physical objects throughsense perception, which limits our scope —our access to the heavens, for example —and makes us prey to all sorts of perceptual error. 465In fact the scienti ﬁc aspect ofphysics and (yet) its f ailure to attain anything more than probability reﬂect its hybrid character: in introducing mathematical laws it starts from a basis inspired by universal and unerring principles; but the formulation of these laws by, and in relation to, physical bodies diminishes their universality andaccuracy, given the ‘errant ’nature ofthese bodies and the f allibility ofour perceptual access to them. The‘mixed ’character ofphysics 466is found by Proclus also in the fact that much of Timaeus' discourse is concerned, not with the world, but with its transcendent ‘divine ’causes: the demiurge, the Forms, the lesser gods, soul. In this sense the Timaeus can be regarded as a ‘theology ’: not a theology, or science ofthe divine per sesuch as Proclus ﬁnds in theParmenides, but a discourse on the divine as producing the world: Thus Socrates shows that he wishes the physics to be Pythagorean, one that begins from the divine cause, and notone such as he rejected in the Phaedo, which blinds the eye ofthe soul, holding as responsible causes winds and ether according to Anaxagoras. For true physics must be attached to theology, as nature depends upon the gods. 467 The reference to Pythagoreanism reminds us that Iamblichus, according to Proclus, emphasized the theological aspectsofthe Timaeus. 468184 MATHEMATICS AND PHYSICS IN PROCLUS 464In Tim.

Aristotle concernshimselfmainly with immanent causes, matter and f orm in nature, and pays less attention than does Plato to thetranscendent ef ﬁcient, paradigmatic, and ﬁnal causes (I 2, 15 –3, 20). It follows that to the extent that he neglects the divine presupposites ofnature Aristotle diminishes that which gives physics what scienti ﬁc value it can have (cf. I 295, 26–7). 5.TheApplicationofMathematicalTruthsinPhysics It can be seen from the preceding section that the contribution of mathematics to physics is not con ﬁned to the area of method. Geometry provides a scienti ﬁc form of demonstration to physics. But physics also introduces speci ﬁc mathematical principles and laws in its explanations. What might be called the substantive (as compared to themethodological) contribution of mathematics to physics is no less important for Proclus than it is for Iamblichus. Aparticularly striking aspect ofProclus' Commentary on the Timaeus is the somewhat complicated, oblique way in which mathematical truths are sometimes applied to physics. They are not simply read into nature, but are transformed invarious ways in the course ofbeing applied. In order to reach a better understanding ofthis procedure it will be usef ulto examine once more the place ofmathematical objects in the scheme ofreality, in particular vis-à-vis natural objects. For it is a reasonable assumption that the ontological relations between these different sorts of objects imply certainconditions governing the application ofthe one sort to the other.The nature ofmathematical objects as projections ofprinciples innate in the soul has been discussed above in Chapter8 in connection with the Commentary on Euclid. However, the place ofthis nature in the structure ofreality, as determined by Proclus in the Commentary on the Timaeus, remains to be identi ﬁed. We might begin with the simpli ﬁed three-level system— sensible/mathematical/intelligible objects —that Iamblichus attributes ( Comm. 10, 7–11, 15) to the</p><div id="pagenum"><p>‘Pythagoreans ’. The same ‘Pythagorean ’system reappears in SyrianusMATHEMATICAL TRUTHS IN PHYSICS 185</p></div><div id="pagenum"><p>(above, p. 131) and in Proclus' Commentary on the Timaeus, at I 8, 13 –27, and again at II 23, 9– 25:</p></div><p id="page">After the mathematical grasp of these words ( Tim.31 c–32 a) we must turn to a physical interpretation. For we must not digress by remaining in mathematics (for the dialogue is about physics), nor must we neglect mathematics,seeking out only the perceptible, but we must join the two and always weave together mathematicals and physicals,just as the realities themselves are woven together and are homogeneous and ofthe same parent 469according to the derivation from Intellect. And indeed if in general the Pythagoreans place mathematical reality between intelligiblesand sensibles, as more unfolded than intelligibles and as more universal than sensibles, why then must we think onlyofphysics, neglecting mathematicals? For how is the sensible 〈world〉organized? According to what principles? From what principles did it come ifnot mathematical ones? Such principles then obtain ﬁrst in souls, having descended from Intellect, and then are found in bodies having come from souls. Proclus indicates at various points in his Commentary that certain distinctions must be introduced in the three-level scheme. (i) Firstly, for the human soul as knower, we must distinguish between the objects ofits mathematical thought and the mathematical principles constituting its essence: although the monadic quantitative numbers ofarithmetic areimages ofthe essential psychic numbers, the f ormer are not to be conf used with the latter. 470In the Timaeus Plato introduces geometrical and harmonic elements in the constitution ofthe soul: Proclus indicates that these also are notto be interpreted according to ordinary mathematical usage (as the objects studied in mathematics), but are to beunderstood in a higher sense (II 245, 23 –246, 4). Indeed all four of the mathematical sciences are pre-contained essentially at a higher level in the constituents ofsoul (II 238, 10 –239, 16). (ii) A distinction must also be made between psychic essential number, the mathematical unfolding or discursive image of this, and the empirical or ‘opinative ’ number produced in the perceptual observations ofastronomy. 471Both mathematical and opinative number are generated from psychic number, but opinative number is derived indirectly, through perception ofenmattered images (‘physical numbers ’)o f186 MATHEMATICS AND PHYSICS IN PROCLUS 469A Plotinian image (cf.

In this workthe demiurge imitates the Forms, which in consequence can also be referred to as ‘number ’. 473The subject of ‘ideal’ and‘divine ’number will be examined in the next chapter and need not delay us here. This scheme of different sorts and levels of numbers, which is essentially the same as that proposed by Syrianus, maybe used to determine the conditions under which mathematics is applicable in physics roughly as follows. To be used inphysics, the objects with which the mathematician deals must, on the one hand, be puri ﬁed ofthe f eatures produced through their being projected from the soul's nature. These features include quantity in arithmeticals and extension ingeometricals. By removing such additions in mathematicals we can approach nearer to the principles innate in the soulwhich, as divine demiurgic principles, guide her in her organization ofthe world. Allowance must be made, on theother hand, for the fact that the principles of the soul are not expressed perfectly in the world: the materiality of theworld diminishes the universality and accuracy ofsuch principles as re ﬂected in the world. These two requirements show that an indirect and quali ﬁed, rather than a direct and simple application ofmathematics to physics is appropriate. Our reliance on perception for matching mathematical principles with their physical analogues introducesa further limiting factor. The results of ‘opinative ’mathematics, such as astronomical calculation based on observation, must, it appears, be far inferior to those of ‘projected ’mathematics since they do not derive from discursive articulation ofthe psychic principles governing the world, but depend on perception mediating particularized andﬂeeting instantiations ofsuch principles. Such quali ﬁcations and conditions for the application in physics of mathematics can plausibly be inferred, I believe, from Proclus'MATHEMATICAL TRUTHS IN PHYSICS 187 472Cf.In Tim.

Whether he does in fact observe them may be determined at least in the following examples of theuse ofmathematics in his Commentary.</p></div><p id="page">(i) In the ﬁrst case Proclus is commenting (II 20, 19 –28, 7) on the passage ofthe Timaeus concerning the proportion (ἀναλογ ία) that the demiurge uses to link and unify the elements of the world: Wherefore also God in the beginning of creation made the body of the universe to consist of ﬁre and earth. But two things cannot be rightly put together without a third; there must be some bond ofunion between them. And thefairest bond is that which makes the most complete fusion of itself and the things which it combines, andproportion is best adapted to effect such a union. For whenever in any three numbers, whether cube or square,there is a mean, which is to the last term what the ﬁrst term is to it, and again when the mean is to the ﬁrst term as the last term to the mean —then the mean becoming ﬁrst and last, and the ﬁrst and last both becoming means, they will all ofthem ofnecessity come to be the same, and having become the same with one another will be all one.(Tim.31 c–32 a, transl. Jowett) As in other similar instances, Proclus discusses ﬁrst the mathematical aspects ofthis passage and then turns, in a clearly marked transition, to consider the passage with reference to its physical doctrine.(a) The mathematical question the passage poses for him concerns the kind of proportion —arithmetic, geometric or harmonic —to which Plato is referring. Proclus agrees with Nicomachus ( Intro. arith. 129, 14 –20) that Plato is thinking ofgeometric proportion. For Plato speaks ofthe samerelation (λόγος) between extreme and middle terms (in geometric proportion the proportion is the same, e.g. double in 1:2 = 2:4), not of an equal quantitative differencebetween the terms (as in an arithmetic proportion such as 1:2 = 2:3), nor ofthe same f ractions ofthe extremes (as in aharmonic proportion such as 3:4 = 4:6, where the middle term exceeds and is exceeded by a third ofthe extremes). 474 Proclus then brings out the property or feature characteristic of geometric proportion, namely the identity (ταυτότης)o f relation that the middle term produces in regard to the extremes, binding them together and communicating to eachthe same relation. This identity he regards as superior to the ‘equality ’characteristic ofarithmetical proportions and to the‘similarity ’he attributes to harmonic proportions, and he describes it as leading up to and depending on unity (ἕνωσις).188 MATHEMATICS AND PHYSICS IN PROCLUS</p><div id="pagenum"><p>474Cf. Nicomachus, Intro. arith. 126, 12 –128, 19.</p></div><div id="pagenum"><p>Proclus then moves (b) to the physical interpretation ofthe Platonic passage (II 23, 9). He stresses that the mathematical</p></div><p id="page">theory must not be confused with the physics of the passage, for the transition is ‘to another genus’,475but that the mathematical theory can throw light on the physics. What then in physics is the proportion binding the elements oftheworld? For Proclus it is the cosmic life that penetrates the world giving it the uni ﬁed life of a living animal. There are other principles ofuni ﬁcation —the demiurgic causes ‘above ’this life and the particular forms and qualities of the elements ‘below ’—but Proclus takes Plato to be referring to an immanent (rather than transcendent) and causative (rather than caused) ‘physical proportion ’, the lif e-principle ofthe universe. The living texture and rhythm ofthe universe re ﬂect the work ofthis physical analogue ofgeometric proportion: it gives physical substances ‘rational and homologous ’ 476relationships to each other, i.e. the same proportional relations link them as terms in a series; it produces the development out ofunity and return to its cause, the multiplying and reuniting ofthe lif e ofthe world, apattern that recalls the progressive and regressive aspects ofgeometric proportion: the subsequent terms ofageometric series are produced by the same proportion; the middle term ‘brings back ’the third to the ﬁrst term. The participation ofthe elements in each other in the world also has its analogue in geometric proportion, in which extremeterms can function as means (e.g. 2:4 = 1:2). Proclus ﬁnally attributes identity to the cosmic life, a feature corresponding to the property he found to be characteristic of geometric proportion.Proclus does not propose then a direct mathematical reading ofthe physics ofPlato's passage. For him Plato is notsimply thinking ofa mathematical proportion linking the elements ofthe universe. Rather, a physical cause must be found that possesses a nature and function analogous to what is characteristic of geometric proportion. The parallelbetween this physical cause (the cosmic life-principle) and geometric proportion is developed in such a way as to avoidmathematizing the speci ﬁc physical character (or categorial domain) ofthis cause and its ef f ects. The geometric proportion ofthe mathematician is not the binding power ofthe universe, but it illustrates in its own ﬁeld features which also are found in its ‘sister’(above, p. 186) in the natural realm. The parallel between geometric proportion and the cosmic life-principle depends, we can assume, on the fact that theyMATHEMATICAL TRUTHS IN PHYSICS 189 475II 23, 30 –2; this is Aristotle's caveat, An. post.

Proclus does not tell us what geometric proportion puri ﬁed ofits projected</p></div><p id="page">(discursive, extended) aspect might turn out to be, but one can imagine that it would coincide essentially with thecosmic life-principle. He does, however, allow for the distortions that the material world can produce in the action ofthis life-principle: sensible objects, as divisible and ‘other’, attain identity and unity only in that, through the action of the life-principle, they reach an ‘afﬁnity to identity and, through it, to unity ’(27, 10– 13). (ii) The second case ofmathematical physics I propose to examine comes a little later (II 28, 14 –42, 2), in commentary on the next lines ofthe Timaeus : If the universal frame had been created a surface only and having no depth, a single mean would have suf ﬁced to bind together itselfand the other terms, but now, as the world must be solid, and solid bodies are always compactednot by one mean but by two, God placed water and air in the mean between ﬁre and earth. ( Tim.32 a b, transl. Jowett) In explaining this passage Proclus ﬁrst argues, very much as Aristotle does, that change takes place between contraries and that there must therefore be two contrary elements of the world, ﬁre and earth (II 28, 14 –30, 8). He then tries to show why two intermediate elements are needed to link the extremes. The demonstration ofthe Platonic postulate isprovided ﬁrst in mathematical and then in physical terms. (a) The mathematical demonstration begins with numbers, for they are what is ‘originative ’(ἀϱχοɛιδές) and ‘self- existent ’(αὐτοϕυές) as compared to ‘geometrical necessity ’(30, 13– 15); i.e. the objects ofarithmetic, hence its demonstrations, are higher than those ofgeometry, thus nearer the source in psychic nature. 477Proclus then argues that ‘solid ’numbers (cubes), as distinct from ‘plane ’numbers (squares), require two middle terms in a proportion: e.g. in the series 8, 12, 18, 27, the cubes that are the extremes 8 (23) and 27 (33) are linked by 12 (22×3) and 18 (32×2), whereas only one middle term maysufﬁce to link two plane numbers, as in the series 9 (32), 12 (3 ×4), 16 (42). The fundamental feature of the middle terms linking two solid numbers (cubes) is the fact that each middle term is madeup oftwo ‘sides ’ofone extreme and one side ofthe other (thus 2 2×3 = 12, 32×2 = 18).190 MATHEMATICS AND PHYSICS IN PROCLUS</p><div id="pagenum"><p>477Cf. also 34, 4 –27, where it is claimed that what Plato says is truer in arithmetic than in geometry.</p></div><div id="pagenum"><p>(b) The same principles hold for Proclus in physics: physical planes may be linked together by one middle term,whereas physical solids require two middle terms. Thus two elements, water and air, are needed to connect ﬁre and</p></div><p id="page">earth. On the subject ofphysical planes Proclus cites the view ofIamblichus —whom he praises as alone having gone beyond the mathematical problem to consider the physical one —that they are the powers and forms of solids. As for solids, in this case the elements, the extremes ( ﬁre and earth) must each contain three powers or qualities in order to yield the one different and two common qualities needed by the two middle terms, as demonstrated in the case ofcubic numbers (39, 19 –27). This produces the physical series: Fire ( ﬁneness, sharpness, mobility) Air (ﬁneness, bluntness, mobility) Water (thickness, bluntness, mobility)Earth (thickness, bluntness, immobility). In this series the properties ofthe ‘middle ’elements link the extremes much as the ‘sides ’ofthe middle terms link cubic numbers: each middle element is composed oftwo qualities ofone extreme and one quality ofthe other. Thesame principle ofmediation governs physical and arithmetical solids.It appears then that the physical elements are linked to each other according to a structure ofdouble mediationechoing that which links two solid numbers. This represents but an instance ofthe general principle that ‘physicals are images ofmathematicals ’(39, 18 –19). However, Proclus does not regard his demonstration ofwhy two middle elements are required as merely an application ofmathematical theory in physics. His argument is based rather onanalysis ofthe physical nature ofthe elements themselves, an analysis which shows up the three aspects that eachelement must have ifit is to f unction with the other elements in the constitution ofphysical bodies. And it is withphysical, not mathematical, arguments that Proclus rejects theories according to which fewer than four elements mightbe required or which would ﬁnd in each element fewer than three powers or qualities required to link together the elements. 478Ifthen the same structure ofdouble mediation occurs both in mathematics (f or solid numbers) and in physics (for the elements), this is supposed to result,MATHEMATICAL TRUTHS IN PHYSICS 191</p><div id="pagenum"><p>478Cf. 28, 20 –30, 4; 37, 14 –41, 9.</p></div><div id="pagenum"><p>I would suggest, not from direct application of mathematics to physics, but rather from the fact that mathematicsarticulates in a clearer and more accurate way a principle which governs and is expressed also in a more imperfect way</p></div><p id="page">in the physical structure ofthe world.In this second case ofProclus' use ofmathematics in relation to physics, the approach seems to be as indirect andoblique as that observed in the ﬁrst case. Proclus does not simply settle issues in physics by reference to mathematics. However, mathematics shows up more clearly principles that also obtain in physics and that can be formulated on thebasis ofphysical analysis. In both cases I believe we can conclude that Proclus' approach to mathematics in connectionwith physical theory is consonant with what one would expect given the places assigned to mathematical and physicalprinciples within the structure ofreality. Proclus' laudatory ref erence to Iamblichus' attention (in his lost Commentary on the Timaeus ) to the physical dimension raises the question as to the extent ofProclus' debt, in his way ofusing mathematics, to Iamblichus. Certainly Iamblichus was as clear about the need to avoid confusing mathematics withphysics, as about the paradigmatic value ofmathematics in physics. And it appears to be the case that Proclus here (37,14 ff.) is following in general Iamblichus' physical approach as described at 36, 20 –37, 14, even ifhe is expanding, clarif ying, and perhaps altering some ofthe details ofthis approach.(iii) The third case that I wish to mention concerns Proclus' use of ‘opinative ’mathematics in physics. As we might expect, calculations based on sense-perception have little value for him. Thus, when astronomical calculations lead to atheory ofthe precession ofthe equinoxes that con ﬂicts with Plato's system, Proclus does not believe such calculations are a match for the divine authority of Plato and the Chaldaeans. Even the observations made by the Chaldaeanssufﬁce, Proclus believes, to discredit the theory. 479 6.ConcludingComment The results ofthe above study ofProclus' treatment ofphysics show both his debt to Iamblichus and his originality.His preference for192MATHEMATICS AND PHYSICS IN PROCLUS</p><div id="pagenum"><p>479III 124, 19 –125, 4; cf.

In interpreting the ‘Pythagorean ’physics ofPlato's Timaeus, Proclus makes considerable use ofmathematics as a source ofparadigms f or physics. However, he distinguishes between the domains ofphysics and mathematics anddoes not simply impose mathematical solutions to problems in physics. His use ofmathematics is rather oblique,reﬂecting, I believe, the fact that mathematical principles are not for him the direct model of the universe, but are quantitative discursive projections by the human soul ofhigher principles which, on the divine level, guide the makingofthe world. In a Pythagorean physics such as that suggested in Nicomachus' works, a more direct application ofmathematics to physics is assumed, and this is also the impression given by the fragments of Iamblichus' On Pythagoreanism V. However, Iamblichus is clear about the need to avoid confusing mathematics with physics, and Proclus praises him for having paid attention, in his interpretation of the Timaeus, not only to the mathematical, but also to the physical dimension.Aﬁnal comment might be ventured on Iamblichus' and Proclus' Pythagorean mathematical physics as seen from a modern stand-point. Their ‘realism ’with respect to the existence ofmathematical objects is certainly a plausible position and is combined in an interesting way with another plausible approach in which such objects are explained asconstructions ( ‘projections ’) for which the mathematician is responsible. 480What would create greater dif ﬁculty today would be the overall metaphysical view according to which these constructions are (indirectly) models ofthe universe,in so far as the universe is the work of divine soul using principles from which derive the projections of themathematician. On the other hand, this overall metaphysical view certainly gives some account ofthe mathematicalbackground of physics. However, the sense in which physics is mathematical is no doubt very different from what isthe case in modern mathematical physics. One obvious difference consists in the kind ofCONCLUDING COMMENT 193</p><div id="pagenum"><p>480Cf. Annas (1976), 151.</p></div><div id="pagenum"><p>mathematics used by Iamblichus and Proclus.

When then</p></div><p id="page">it comes to physics, which in Iamblichus and Proclus takes the form of an Aristotelian natural philosophy revised so asto conform to Neoplatonic metaphysics, a correspondence can be established between it and mathematics for thesimple reason that both re ﬂect the same metaphysical assumptions.

In this programme Iamblichus also pointed to the use ofmathematics in othersciences, in ethics and psychology for example, and materials relating to such a mathematical ethics and mathematicalpsychology can also be found in Proclus. 482However, mathematics, for Iamblichus, was of most importance as a preparation f or and anticipation ofthe highest level ofscience, that ofthe study ofpure intelligible being and ofthegods. Proclus, as has been seen, uses the same approach in his Commentary on Euclid, and in other works, in particular in the Elements ofTheology, the Commentary on the Parmenides, and the Platonic Theology, both discusses mathematical transpositions upwards to the divine and develops in detail an account ofthe science ofthe divine, dialectic ortheology.According to the reconstruction proposed above in chapter 3 of On Pythagoreanism VII, Iamblichus may possibly have reacted to Aristotle's attacks on the Platonic theory ofintelligible Forms and numbers, anticipating the f uller responsegiven by Syrianus in his Commentary on the Metaphysics. It seems at any rate that Iamblichus in his book suggested analogies between the properties and ﬂow ofnumbers f rom the monad to the triad (and possibly to the decad) and the gods, i.e. an ultimate principle, the One, and an order ofunities intervening between it and the level ofintelligiblebeing, the same principles being traced in their lower forms on the intellectual, psychic, and physical levels.

In the following pages I shall examine some of the ways in which Proclus adopted and developed Iamblichus' Pythagoreanizing approach to the highest levels ofphilosophy. In particular I would like to bring out the distinctionsProclus makes between the science ofthe divine proper and the theological transpositions ofmathematics, distinctionswhich will entail a briefaccount ofProclus' conception ofthe science ofthe divine. Although insisting, I believe, evenmore than did Iamblichus on the subordination oftheological mathematics to the science ofthe divine, Proclus betraysin certain areas ofhis account ofthis science the in ﬂuence ofIamblichean theological mathematics, as will be shown towards the end ofthe chapter. 1.TheElementsofTheology:AGeometricalMetaphysics? Ifthe prologues ofProclus' Commentary on Euclid were to be well known and highly valued by mathematicians, historians, and philosophers ofmathematics, his Elements ofTheology was to have, in other circles, no less great a success. Already in the Middle Ages it was translated into a number oflanguages, Georgian, Arabic, Hebrew, Armenian, andLatin, 483and the Latin translation ofan abbreviated and modi ﬁed Arabic version, the De causis, became a basic textbook ofmetaphysics in Western Medieval philosophy. The Elements ofTheology remains the ﬁrst book ofProclus to be read by philosophers and historians ofphilosophy. This success is due in part no doubt to the pedagogic qualities ofthe work,a (relative) clarity and simplicity ofexposition which takes a f orm that is also intellectually appealing and impressive:the work consists ofa series ofpropositions, each proposition being accompanied by one or more demonstrations, thepremises constituting the demonstrations sometimes deriving as conclusions from earlier arguments, the wholeappearing in this way as a systematic and rigorous deduction ofa series ofabstract metaphysical truths. The impressionofscienti ﬁc rigour is reinforced by the Euclidean character of some of the arguments and language. 484It is not then196 MATHEMATICS AND METAPHYSICS IN PROCLUS 483Cf.

Is geometrical demonstrative method applied to metaphysics in the way that Proclus applies it to physics in the Elements ofPhysics ? Ifone compares the two works one soon notices some important differences. Firstly, the Elements ofPhysics, as indicated in Chapter 9, does not deal with physics in general, but is concerned with motion and change as pointing to the existence ofan immaterialprinciple ofmotion. On the other hand, the Elements ofTheology covers the whole range ofthe science ofthe divine (‘theology ’), going f rom the highest principle ofall reality, the One, down through the lower levels ofthe divine to the lowest, the level ofsoul. 486Secondly, the Elements ofPhysics is much nearer to Euclid in form than is the Elements of Theology, in that its demonstrations are preceded by de ﬁnitions, whereas the Elements ofTheology simply presents a succession ofpropositions which f unction as the conclusions ofthe demonstrations supporting them.487 This last point is suf ﬁcient to show that the Elements ofTheology is not a geometricized metaphysics in the way that the Elements ofPhysics is a geometricized physics; Proclus does not simply apply Euclidean demonstrative method to metaphysical doctrine. How then account for the undeniable geometrical aspects of the Elements ofTheology? Our study ofthe Commentary on Euclid in Chapter 8 has led to conclusions that are relevant here. One ofthese conclusions was that Proclus tends to see geometry as exemplifying particularly well scienti ﬁc reasoning on the discursive level. Hence geometrical method is assimilated by him to what we would call logical rigour. In whatever context this rigour isapplied we will ﬁnd in consequence a tendency in Proclus to allude to geometrical procedures and terms. Although closely associating geometrical with scienti ﬁc method, Proclus also insists, in his revision ofIamblichus in his Commentary on Euclid, that geometryEL.

In his theological works Proclus also brings out these four constituentsofdialectical method. 488This method can appear geometrical to the extent that it is the source ofand is imaged in geometrical method. Ifthen the Elements ofTheology appears in certain respects to be somewhat geometrical and in other respects not, this may be because the work is not a geometrical theology or metaphysics at all, but somethingquite different: a treatise of theology or dialectic, whose method is proper to it, while recalling to some degree thederivative but more familiar and accessible procedures of geometry.To show more fully that the Elements ofTheology is an example oftheology or dialectic proper it will be necessary to examine what Proclus conceives theology or dialectic to be. For this purpose we will need to refer to Proclus' othertheological works. For ifthe Elements ofTheology, as an introductory manual, possesses a certain clarity, it is by no means self -explanatory. Like other manuals it distils and orders the results ofa long and complicated development ofthoughtwhose assumptions and turning-points can disappear under the surface of didactic exposition. These assumptions inProclus' way ofconceiving theology or dialectic can be detected more easily in his two major theological works, hisCommentary on the Parmenides and his Platonic Theology. 2.TheScienceofDialectic Towards the beginning ofhis Platonic Theology (I 17, 18 –20, 25) Proclus presents four different ways of communicating knowledge ofthe divine: the inspired approach exempli ﬁed in Plato's Phaedrus and characteristic ofthe ‘Chaldaean Oracles ’; the symbolic approach to be found in Plato's myths and in Orpheus; the use of images, in particular mathematical images, to express the divine that is practised by Pythagoras and Pythagoreans as well as by Plato; andﬁnally the one truly scienti ﬁc approach, which is to be found only in Plato, in dialectical exposition of the divine in the Sophist and particularly in the Parmenides :198 MATHEMATICS AND METAPHYSICS IN PROCLUS</p><div id="pagenum"><p>488Cf.Theol. Plat. I 40, 5 –13 (with Saffrey and Westerink's notes); In Tim. I 276, 10 –14.</p></div><div id="pagenum"><p>The scienti ﬁc〈mode ofexposition 〉is peculiar to Plato's philosophy. For he alone, as I believe, among those</p></div><p id="page">known to us, undertook to distinguish and order appropriately the ordered progression ofthe divine kinds, thedifferences between them, the common characteristics of all levels and those proper to each. (20, 19 –25) This fourfold division can be found elsewhere in Proclus. 489It expresses very clearly the difference between mathematical imagings ofthe divine and the science proper ofthe divine. Ifthis distinction is one that Iamblichushimselfhad made in On Pythagoreanism VII, it takes a form in Proclus that represents, as we have seen in Chapter 7, a new departure: Proclus ﬁnds in Plato alone the science ofthe divine, properly speaking. The subordination of theologizing mathematics to theology or dialectic thus becomes also a subordination ofPythagoreanism to thephilosophy ofPlato. And this subordination ofPythagoreanism to Plato in turn makes more evident the limitations oftheologizing mathematics and the superiority and distinctiveness ofPlatonic dialectic.But what then is the science ofthe divine? Proclus, as noted above and in connection with the Commentary on Euclid, regards Plato's Parmenides as an exposition ofthis science and devotes his very long Commentary on the Parmenides to showing this. Ifhis Commentary cannot be regarded as a reliable guide to reading Plato's dialogue, it is a rich source of inf ormation concerning Proclus' own conception ofPlatonic dialectic and is testimony ofthe lengths to which he hadto go in order to make Plato's text correspond to this conception. It will suf ﬁce then, in order to sketch brie ﬂy Proclus' views on the science ofthe divine, to note some aspects ofhis interpretation ofthe Parmenides. 490 In connection with explaining the roles ofSocrates and ofParmenides in the Platonic dialogue, Proclus describes theideal attributes ofthe student (Socrates) and teacher (Parmenides) ofdialectic. 491The student must, among other things, have an adequate intellectual preparation, in particular in logic, physics, and mathematics, for these sciencesprepare the mind for contemplation of the divine by making the divine more accessible to it through images.THE SCIENCE OF DIALECTIC 199 489Cf.In Parm. 646, 21 –647, 16 (on the Pythagorean use ofmathematical images as contrasted with dialectic cf . also 623, 29 –34; 924, 4 –9);Theol.

Steel (1987).</p></div><div id="pagenum"><p>Thus, in a passage that could also come from the Commentary on Euclid, Proclus suggests that</p></div><p id="page">ifhe〈the student 〉wonders how the many could be in the One, and all in the indivisible, let him think ofthe monad and how it is shown that all forms of odd and even are 〈pre-contained 〉in it, the circle and sphere, and the other forms of numbers.492 The teacher, who leads the student ofdialectic, on the other hand, will not wish to reveal the divine truth with many words, but to reveal many things with few, speaking in unisonwith thought. Nor will he start from the familiar, but will consider matters from on high, from the most uni ﬁed principles, since he is removed from what is at hand, and is near to the divine. (927, 38 –928, 9) To these attributes ofthe teacher ofdialectic we should add that ofscienti ﬁc rigour, the strict syllogistic exposition of the subject that Proclus ﬁnds in the Parmenides and that he sometimes conceives as ‘geometrical ’in character, 493that is, as suggested above, as exemplifying scienti ﬁc method. Plato's ﬁgure Parmenides exhibits in the dialogue these attributes ofthe ideal ‘guide ’to dialectic: simplicity, purity, scienti ﬁc rigour, presenting the subject by starting from ‘on high ’, from ‘the most uni ﬁed principles ’, and demonstrating all else on the basis ofsuch principles. These principles correspond to the hypotheses that Parmenidesproposes to Socrates. They are hypothetical in two senses: as representing the beginnings ofthe ascent throughhypotheses to an ‘unhypothetical ’ﬁrst principle that is described as the ﬁrst phase ofdialectic in Plato's Republic ; 494and as corresponding to what functions as hypotheses, that is ‘common notions ’or axioms, in geometry.495We may say then that just as geometrical demonstrations proper have as starting-points certain evident truths, so, on a higher level,do dialectical demonstrations start from certain fundamental metaphysical truths such as are expressed in thehypotheses ofthe Parmenides. And indeed just as the ﬁrst principles ofgeometry are a priori concepts given in psychic nature which the geometer ‘projects ’200 MATHEMATICS AND METAPHYSICS IN PROCLUS 492In Parm. 926, 16 –29 and ff.; cf. above, p. 161. 493Cf.In Parm. 645, 9 –27; 727, 8 –10; 1132, 20 –6; 1140, 19 –22; 1195, 26 –30; 1206, 1 –3. 494Cf.In Parm. 622, 21 –623, 28; 1033, 20 –1034, 30 (where Proclus says he is following Syrianus); Beierwaltes (1979), 253 –74.</p><div id="pagenum"><p>495Cf.In Parm. 930, 6 –9; 1034, 1 –2; 1092, 19 –34; 1099, 39 –1100, 10; Beierwaltes (1979), 261 ff.</p></div><div id="pagenum"><p>or‘unrolls ’in his demonstrations, so the dialectician takes his beginning from certain primary a priori metaphysical</p></div><p id="page">concepts which he then articulates in his demonstrations.496 The idea that there are certain metaphysical concepts given in psychic nature and transcending mathematical conceptscan be found already in Syrianus. 497In Proclus —ifonly because ofthe large amount ofhis work that survives —the meaning and importance ofthis idea are clearer. In particular Proclus associates (i) the (Stoic) notion that there arecertain truths universally held by mankind, such as the existence and providence ofthe divine, with (ii) the(Aristotelian) notion that certain principles are known, not by demonstration, but by a sort ofintellectual insight ( νωυ ̑ς), and with (iii) the geometrical concept ofcertain truths as evident, axioms. 498Associating these notions, Proclus thus ﬁnds at the highest level ofhuman re ﬂection a number ofconcepts, ofmetaphysical content, intuitively known as given in the nature ofsoul, and f unctioning as the starting-points ofthe demonstrations ofthe dialectician.499 In demonstrating fundamental metaphysical insights the dialectician does not attempt to prove them. Rather he‘unfolds ’or explicates them, showing what they presuppose and what they entail. This procedure corresponds in fact to the structure ofsyllogistic argument, whereby the conclusion shows what is implied by the premises. In thetreatment ofhis ﬁrst hypothesis the dialectician begins with a truth that is not, according to what Plato suggests in the Republic, the very ﬁrst metaphysical truth which all other metaphysical truths presuppose. 500The dialectician must therefore work back from his starting-point to such an ultimate truth and then, again following the procedureprescribed by the Republic, work down from this truth, showing how all other truths derive from the ﬁrst. In doing this the dialectician unf olds a series ofconcepts that corresponds to and speaks ofthe unf olding ofthe structure ofrealityfrom its ultimate source in the One. 501THE SCIENCE OF DIALECTIC 201 496Cf. 1151, 38 –1152, 5; the ﬁrst hypothesis ofthe Parmenides is described as a νόημαinTheol.

What other shall we mention but the simplest and most knowable ofall her concepts? For this concept is most akin to thecontemplation ofintellect. What is it then? Parmenides says (137 c): ‘The One, ifit is one, may not be many. ’For the many must participate in the One. But the One does not participate in the One but is the One itself. 502 From this truth Parmenides demonstrates, according to Proclus, the derivation, in order and according to strictsyllogistic procedure, ofsubsequent metaphysical truths, expressing thereby in scienti ﬁc form the derivation of all levels ofthe divine f rom an ultimate principle. Proclus summarizes the procedure thus: For the ﬁrst conclusions are made evident immediately from the smallest number and the most simple and most knowable 〈ofconcepts 〉, common concepts so-to-speak; and the conclusions subsequent to these 〈are demonstrated 〉through more numerous and complex 〈concepts〉; and the last are the most composite. For Parmenides always uses the ﬁrst conclusions for demonstrations of the subsequent and offers, as an intellectual paradigm ofthe order in geometry and in the other mathematical sciences, this chain ofconclusions ﬁtted to each other. Ifthen discourse brings an image ofthe things it interprets ( Tim.29 b), and as are the demonstrative unfoldings 〈explications 〉so must what are demonstrated be in order, it is necessary, I believe, that the ﬁrst conclusions demonstrated from the simplest premises must be absolutely primary and joined closely to the One,those that are multiplied continuously and depend on complex demonstrations being products at a greater distance,in‘alienation ’, one might say, ‘from the One ’. 503 I have suggested elsewhere (1986) that Proclus' conception ofdialectic represents a theory ofmetaphysics whoseoriginality and coherence has hitherto been scarcely noticed, a result no doubt ofthe f act that it regards itselfas nomore than an exegesis, and an improbable one at that, ofPlato. In view ofthe lack ofevidence concerning Syrianus it isdifﬁcult to determine the extent ofProclus' debt here to Syrianus, although we may suppose that a certain amount derives202MATHEMATICS AND METAPHYSICS IN PROCLUS 502Theol. Plat. II 66, 1 –9.</p><div id="pagenum"><p>503Theol. Plat. I 45, 20 –46, 9; Saffrey and Westerink indicate that at the end Proclus is quoting Plotinus, VI 6, 1.</p></div><div id="pagenum"><p>from Syrianus.504Even less is known ofhow Iamblichus conceived dialectic or the science ofthe divine. But one can</p></div><p id="page">reasonably suppose that Iamblichus did not, as does Proclus, discount the scienti ﬁc claims ofPythagorean theory, reserving for Plato alone the title of true dialectician. This probably means that Proclus did not ﬁnd in Iamblichus' accounts ofPythagorean theology an approach corresponding to his conception ofdialectic. In other words there issome likelihood that in clarifying and systematizing the distinction between theologizing mathematics and theology ordialectic proper, Proclus came to conceive ofthe latter science in a way that no longer corresponded to Iamblichus'treatment ofthe subject.Be that as it may, it might be noted that in his attempt to formulate the nature of dialectic as a science independent of,superior to, and paradigmatic for mathematics, Proclus is largely guided by his understanding of the structure ofmathematical science, in particular geometry. Thus dialectic, like geometry, ‘projects ’or‘unfolds ’innate a priori concepts, demonstrating them by means ofrigorous syllogistic arguments. The concepts are ofcourse ofa higherorder, nearer the intelligible principles ofsoul and ofa broader application than the concepts explicated by thegeometer. But it remains that mathematics, and in particular geometry, provides Proclus with the model (he would saythe image) ofscienti ﬁc discourse whereby the distinctiveness and superiority ofdialectic vis-à-vis other sciences can be determined. The same phenomenon will be observed in the following section with respect, not to form, but to thecontent ofdialectic. In general one might say that in imposing limits on Iamblichus' Pythagoreanizing ofPlatonicphilosophy, in subordinating Pythagorean mathematics and theologizing mathematics to Platonic dialectic, Proclusadopted for this a principle, namely the image-status of mathematics that he found in Iamblichus' Pythagoreanizingprogramme itself.We may conclude ﬁnally that Proclus' description ofPlatonic dialectic in his Commentary on the Parmenides and in his Platonic Theology corresponds in many respects to the structure ofthe Elements ofTheology. The chain ofsyllogisms described in the passage quoted immediately above is a distinctive feature of the Elements ofTheology. The propositions that precede and are supported by the syllogisms can be regarded as the metaphysical concepts which the dialecticianTHE SCIENCE OF DIALECTIC 203</p><div id="pagenum"><p>504Cf. above nn. 13, 16.</p></div><div id="pagenum"><p>seeks to unfold. Indeed the fourth proposition, ‘All that is uni ﬁed is other than the One itself ’, turns out to be what</p></div><p id="page">Proclus considers as the very ﬁrst metaphysical concept, the ﬁrst hypothesis ofthe Parmenides (‘The One, ifit is one, may not be many ’) if, applying the ﬁrst proposition, we describe all multitude as uni ﬁed. The ﬁrst three propositions and their demonstrations prepare the way and lead up to the ﬁrst metaphysical truth, after which Proclus proceeds to unfold truths concerning divine causes in general and concerning each level of the divine treated in particular and indescending order. Thus the Elements ofTheology shows the motion upwards and downwards that Plato attributes to dialectic in the Republic. However it is especially in the Parmenides that Proclus ﬁnds dialectical exposition, and the correspondence between the fourth proposition of the Elements ofTheology and the ﬁrst hypothesis ofthe Parmenides suggests that the major source ofinspiration ofProclus' work is the Parmenides, as he interpreted that dialogue. 505Thus another striking originality ofthe Elements ofTheology, besides its rigorous syllogistic form —namely the fact that, contrary to Proclus' normal practice, no authorities are cited— can be clari ﬁed, ifthe work is seen as an exposé of dialectic: an authority is in fact present in the work, namely Plato, for the work unfolds the science of the divine thatPlato alone communicated to mankind. 3.MathematicalTheologyandDialectic In the preceding section I have attempted to indicate how Proclus, emphasizing a point already made by Iamblichus,drew a clear distinction between theologizing mathematics and theology or dialectic proper, and how, in order to bringout the distinctiveness and superiority of the latter science, he gave it a form derived from his own understanding ofthe structure ofgeometry. In this section I shall suggest that a similar situation arises with regard to the content of theology: in his account ofthis content, i.e. the divine, Proclus seeks to proceed independently oftheologizingmathematics, but this account can nevertheless be seen to be inspired to a considerable degree by theologizingmathematics.Aﬁrst example ofthis may be f ound in the presentation ofthe gods that Proclus calls ‘henads ’in the Elements of Theology. Having dealt204 MATHEMATICS AND METAPHYSICS IN PROCLUS</p><div id="pagenum"><p>505Dodds indicates in his edition (e.g., 188, 189, 190) connections with the Parmenides ; such parallels could be multiplied.</p></div><div id="pagenum"><p>with the supreme principle, the One, and its relations to its products in the ﬁrst part ofthe Elements ofTheology, Proclus</p></div><p id="page">turns in propositions 113 –65 to the gods that are subordinate to the One and that transcend the level ofintelligible being, the henads. Iamblichus had also treated ofan order ofgods corresponding to these henads in On Pythagoreanism VII,506and what remains ofthis treatment in Psellus' excerpts shows some similarities with Proclus' approach. In both Iamblichus and Proclus this order ofgods is considered as uni ﬁed both in itselfand in each ofits members.507Both treat ﬁrst ofthe general properties ofthe order as a whole bef ore discussing speci ﬁc properties. For both each god is distinct, forms part of a serial ordering, and is re ﬂected in its effects in corresponding features found on the successive lower levels ofreality.508 Yet one notices also in Proclus' account of the henads aspects that differentiate it from the theologizing arithmetic ofOn Pythagoreanism VII. It appears ﬁrst that in referring to the henads as ‘divine number ’Proclus gives to the term ‘number ’a broad, non-mathematical sense, i.e. that ofgroup or class. 509Furthermore, in discussing the speci ﬁc properties ofthe henads, Proclus does not take in turn each ofthe distinct members ofthe order as does Iamblichuswhen he deals with the monad, dyad, triad ofthe order. Rather each property is presented without ref erence toparticular henads. Finally the properties that are named by Proclus —the‘paternal ’, the ‘generative ’, the ‘perfective ’, the ‘protective ’, etc. (props. 151 ff.) —are not especially mathematical in character. It is true that their analogues can be found in mathematical objects: Proclus elsewhere relates the ‘paternal ’to the monad and the ‘generative ’to the dyad, 510 whereas the triad is traditionally regarded as perfective. But it is surely signi ﬁcant that Proclus, in introducing these different properties of the henads, does not attribute them to particular members of a numerical series, as doesIamblichus. It is as ifProclus wishes to avoid an identi ﬁcation ofeach ofthe henads with each number in a decadic series. 511In this we may regard ProclusMATHEMATICAL THEOLOGY AND DIALECTIC 205 506Saffrey and Westerink argue, in Theol. Plat. III ix–lxxvii, against there having been a theory ofhenads in Iamblichus, on the basis ofa study oflater reports in Proclus and Damascius and before the ﬁrst-hand evidence provided by Psellus' excerpts could be considered. 507Proclus, El. theol. props. 113 –14; cf. above, p.84. 508Proclus, props. 133, 135; 126, 136; 129, 131, 145; cf. above, pp. 83 –4. 509Dodds's translation of ἀ∂ιθμόζ(a possible exception may be 104, 9 –10); Merlan argues against this (1965), I believe unconvincingly. 510Cf.Theol.

In</p></div><p id="page">consequence however Proclus' treatment ofthe henads in the Elements is somewhat general and vague. Ifthe henads are not to be seen simply as the monad, dyad, triad ofa decad, it is not clear what individually they are supposed to be.IfProclus' account ofthe henads in the Elements ofTheology seeks to establish itselfindependently ofthe account ofthe same matter yielded by theologizing mathematics, it must be admitted, however, that the source ofinspiration ofmuchofwhat Proclus says ofthe henads is mathematics and theologizing mathematics. I have indicated above the broadsimilarities oftreatment between the section on henads in the Elements and On Pythagoreanism VII. To these one might add Proclus' frequent recourse to mathematical principles and laws. For example the law of mean terms serves to linknot only the members ofthe order ofhenads but also almost everything else in Proclus' theological universe. 512The principles of ‘limit’and the ‘unlimited ’, principles that occur in Plato's Philebus and that Syrianus and Proclus identify with the Pythagorean monad and dyad,513are responsible f or the constitution ofthe order ofhenads. Indeed the concept ofthe monad and its relation to the series it generates is ofgreat importance to the ordering ofreality asProclus conceives it in the Elements. 514One might reasonably say then that despite his effort to separate (Platonic) dialectic or theology from (Pythagorean) theologizing mathematics, Proclus in effect produces a theological accountthat cannot but strike us, in certain respects, as heavily indebted to mathematics.The same can be observed, I believe, in Proclus' other theological works, his Commentary on the Parmenides and his Platonic Theology. In the Commentary on the Parmenides, for example, Proclus treats of the henads in the same very general way that characterizes the account in the Elements ofTheology : the henads are described collectively in terms ofa number ofmetaphysical properties. 515In his interpretation ofthe Parmenides Proclus indicates that mathematical terms occurring in Plato's (theological) text are to be understood, not in a mathematical, but in a higher sense.516And when he analyses the orders ofthe gods in terms ofthe relations between monad and dyad, he notes that he is206MATHEMATICS AND METAPHYSICS IN PROCLUS 512Prop. 132; cf. prop. 148; Dodds, in his edn., xxii. 513Cf. above, p. 146; Sheppard (1982); Beierwaltes (1972), 179 ff. 514Cf. e.g. props. 21 –2 (with Dodds's comment, 208), 204 (178, 28 –31). 515Cf.In Parm. 1048, 14 –1049, 3.</p><div id="pagenum"><p>516In Parm. 1129, 22 –6; 1204, 19 –41.</p></div><div id="pagenum"><p>using a mathematical image.517And yet the use ofmathematical relationships to describe meta-mathematical realities is</p></div><p id="page">such that it is not clear sometimes how such realities could otherwise be presented.518 In the Platonic Theology Proclus also treats ofthe gods in a f ashion that is in part inspired by mathematics while at the same time separating itselff rom theologizing mathematics. On the subject ofthe henads he claims that: There must be an order among the henads such as we see among numbers, some being nearer the 〈ﬁrst〉 principle, others being further away, some being simpler, others more composite, greater in quantity, but lesser inpower. And we have rightly recalled the numbers. For ifwe must contemplate the order ofthe very ﬁrst monads among themselves and the production ofbeings, using numbers as images, it is necessary that in these monadsthose that are nearer the One be shared in by those that are simpler in being, those that are further being shared inby those that are more composite. (III 17, 18 –18, 3) Ifemphasis is placed here on the f unction ofnumbers as images ofhigher realities, in other contexts it looks as if mathematical principles arewhat governs the orders ofthe gods: the monad and its relation to a number series, the interplay between monad and dyad in the production ofthe decad are the structural principles that constitute Proclus'world ofgods. 519 Ofcourse Proclus made use ofother sources in his theology such as the general metaphysical truths he f ound stated inthe hypotheses ofPlato's Parmenides as well as in the utterances ofthe ‘Chaldaean Oracles ’. However, we might plausibly claim, given the examples cited, that his ‘Platonic ’theology, although asserting its independence ofand superiority to ‘Pythagorean ’theologizing mathematics, is still marked by this theologizing mathematics. The somewhat ambivalent character ofhis theology —both mathematical and not mathematical in form and content —is testimony to its origins as, in part at least, a critical reaction to the theologizing mathematics ofIamblichus' Pythagoreanizingprogramme.MATHEMATICAL THEOLOGY AND DIALECTIC 207 517In Parm. 662, 4 –12. 518Cf. e.g. In Parm. 703, 12 –704, 10; 706, 27 –33.</p><div id="pagenum"><p>519Cf. e.g. Theol.

He altered the relations between theﬁgures ofPythagoras and Plato in such a way that Plato and his dialogues took over the pre-eminence given by Iamblichus to Pythagoras and Pythagorean works. For Proclus Plato was the ﬁrst scienti ﬁc philosopher and it is only in Plato's writings that the scienti ﬁc exposition of truth is to be found. This shift in focus is accompanied by a shift in the attitude taken to mathematics in its relations to the other parts ofphilosophy. While acknowledging the mediatory andpivotal role ofmathematics, Proclus insisted on the limitations ofmathematics, in particular as regards a distinct andhigher science, Platonic dialectic. In reducing Pythagorean theology to the status oftheologizing mathematics and inclaiming to ﬁnd in Plato alone the science ofthe divine, Proclus was able to distinguish much more clearly than could Iamblichus between these two approaches to the divine.In presenting the latter point in this chapter I have not tried to survey the full breadth of Proclus' metaphysics. I havesought rather to give some indications ofhow Proclus attempted to separate Pythagoreanizing theologizingmathematics from Platonic dialectic. For this purpose Proclus had to elaborate an interpretation of what preciselyPlatonic dialectic is: Plato himselfgives only some obscure hints, in particular in the Republic. Elaborating an approach inspired, it appears, in some respects by his teacher Syrianus, Proclus conceived ofdialectic very much af ter the patternofthe structure ofgeometry as he understood it: dialectic is a demonstrative science, explicating certain a priorimetaphysical truths given in the soul. These truths are more profound and general than geometrical axioms,concerning as they do the ﬁrst principles ofall reality, the gods. This characterization ofdialectic, ifef f ective in permitting ofa sharp discrimination between the science ofthe divine and theologizing mathematics, is neverthelessbased on an assimilation ofmathematical method to scienti ﬁc method in general. And although in his theology Proclus</p><div id="pagenum"><p>attempts to describe the gods independently of mathematical assimilations, he often introduces what are in effectmathematical concepts and laws. Theology thus establishes itselfin Proclus in large part in208MATHEMATICS AND METAPHYSICS IN PROCLUS</p></div><div id="pagenum"><p>relation to mathematics and theologizing mathematics. The Elements ofTheology may be regarded as a worthy expression</p></div><p id="page"></p><div id="pagenum"><p>of the originality and vigour Proclus brought to bear on the effort to go beyond the Pythagoreanizing theology ofIamblichus in the direction ofthe f ormulation ofa truly Platonic metaphysics. And it is precisely this Iamblicheanbackground that provides a means ofgrasping and measuring the extent ofProclus' achievement.CONCLUDING COMMENT 209</p></div><div id="pagenum"><p>Conclusion</p></div><p id="page">The themes examined in this book, in their integration into Neoplatonic philosophy by Iamblichus and in theiradoption and revision by Syrianus and Proclus, continued to have considerable in ﬂuence on subsequent thinkers. Proclus' successor at Athens, Marinus, appears to have been a better mathematician than philosopher. At any rate heshared the high regard for mathematics that has been found already in Iamblichus, for we are told: Some wonder why, ifwe learn ( μανθάνομɛν) everything, the immaterial, the material, and what is between them, not all are called mathematics ( μαθήματα), but only the intermediate . . . and we say there are two reasons for this, one that mathematics possesses the solidity ofdemonstration, f or we learn it accurately, but we conjecture rather thanlearn the others, for which reason the philosopher Marinus said ‘Would that all were mathematics! ’ 520 The place and f unction ofPythagoras in the history ofphilosophy and the role ofmathematics in philosophy wouldthus merit investigation in their development in the thought ofMarinus and in his successors. It seems, f or example,that Damascius, later head ofthe school, claimed to make a return, in opposition to Proclus, to Iamblicheanphilosophy. 521The fortune of Iamblichus' Pythagoreanizing programme could also be examined in regard to the Alexandrian school. One might note here, for example, that Proclus' pupil Ammonius, in his more favourable attitudeto Aristotle, took more seriously the Aristotelian idea ofnu mbers as abstractions and attempted to combine this with the idea ofnumbers as projections ofhigher a priori concepts.Worth considering also would be the impact Iamblichus' Pythagoreanizing programme would have, in the form givenit in the Athenian and Alexandrian schools, on later periods. One might mention as an example Boethius' shorttheological work known as the De hebdomadibus which would provide, in its geometrical form, a 520Elias, In Porph. Is. 28, 24 –9.</p><div id="pagenum"><p>521Cf. Westerink (1971).</p></div><div id="pagenum"><p>model for scienti ﬁc discourse to Western Medieval theologians.522Later the Latin translation ofProclus' Elements of</p></div><p id="page">Theology would become a paradigm ofmetaphysics f or Bertold ofMoosburg; the short altered Arabic version ofthe Elements in Latin, the De causis, had already served and would continue to serve as the basic textbook, along with Aristotle's Metaphysics, for Medieval metaphysics. When Proclus' Commentary on the Parmenides became available in Latin to Nicholas ofCusa, he would use it extensively in the development ofhis prof ound theories ofthe philosophicalimportance ofmathematics with regard, in particular, to the divine. 523One might mention furthermore the great interest taken by mathematicians in the Renaissance in Iamblichus' philosophy ofmathematics as ref ormulated inProclus' prologues to Euclid, an interest expressed in the idea ofa mathesis universalis that can be traced up to Descartes and beyond. 524 It is not the purpose ofthis book, however, to examine the later history ofNeoplatonic Pythagoreanism, as a thesisabout the origins and history ofwisdom and a theory about the relations between mathematics and the philosophicalsciences. 525I have been concerned rather with its beginnings in Iamblichus' philosophy and its reception by the ﬁrst major philosophers ofthe Athenian school, with the aim ofthrowing some light on this obscure but important phasein the history oflate Greek philosophy. The results might be summarized as f ollows.A tendency to Pythagoreanize is common in the history of Platonism and is represented in different forms and todifferent degrees among Iamblichus' immediate philosophical predecessors, Numenius, Nicomachus of Gerasa,Anatolius, and Porphyry. However, Iamblichus' programme to Pythagoreanize Platonic philosophy was moresystematic and far-reaching. This project is expressed in a number of Iamblichus' commentaries on Plato and Aristotleand is the subject ofa ten-volume work by Iamblichus, On Pythagoreanism. In this work, in so far as it can be analysed on the basis ofthe extant ( ﬁrst four) books and of Psellus' excerpts from Books V –VII, various materials —texts from Plato, Aristotle, (pseudo-)Pythagorean literature —were assembled so as to initiate the reader, step-by-step, to ‘Pythagorean ’philosophy. At ﬁrst the reader is presented with aCONCLUSION 211 522Cf. Schrimpf (1966), Evans (1980), Lohr (1986). 523Cf., for example, Imbach (1978), Schultze (1978), Beierwaltes (1975), 368 –84. 524Cf.

This interpretation of Pythagoras re ﬂects</p></div><p id="page">Iamblichus' Neoplatonic theory ofthe various relations ofsoul to, and f unctions in, the material world. Pythagoras'revelation stands, in Iamblichus' view, for all that is true in the history of Greek philosophy: Plato and later truePlatonists are Pythagoreans, as is Aristotle, to the extent that he remains faithful to Pythagoreanism/Platonism.Pythagorean philosophy, for Iamblichus, is distinguished especially by its concern with immaterial realities, objectswhich give it its scienti ﬁc, i.e. demonstrative, character. One branch ofthis philosophy consists in mathematics, which has the special character ofacting as a mediating knowledg e, as Iamblichus shows in the case ofarithmetic: arithmetic not only functions as a scienti ﬁc paradigm for inquiries that are scarcely scienti ﬁc, concerned as they are with material reality, physics, ethics, politics, poetics, but also prepares the mind and anticipates the intuitive truths ofthe highestlevel ofPythagorean philosophy, the science ofthe divine, theology. This highest level ofPythagoreanism was treated,not in On Pythagoreanism, but in a sequel no longer extant, On God. In developing the paradigmatic function of arithmetic in physics and ethics, Iamblichus adopted much ofAristotle's work on these subjects, modif ying andelaborating it so that it would re ﬂect better what Iamblichus regarded as its essentially Pythagorean inspiration. (In his Commentary on the Categories, Iamblichus also adopted and Pythagoreanized Aristotelian logic.) As for the relations between arithmetic and the science ofthe divine, Iamblichus distinguished between Pythagorean use ofmathematics toimage the divine and a higher approach to the divine. Little is known, however, ofthis higher approach in Iamblichus;mathematical imaging seems to have taken the form of matching the numbers of the decad and their properties to thedivine at its highest levels and at lower levels in a hierarchy ofreality ofconsiderable complexity. The extent ofIamblichus' Pythagoreanizing programme can be seen in the fact that he established a canon of Platonic dialogues andan exegetical approach that are re ﬂections ofthis programme. In Pythagoreanizing Neoplatonic philosophy Iamblichus in effect developed it further, one signi ﬁcant result being the mathematization ofall areas ofphilosophy that is so</p><div id="pagenum"><p>striking a feature of later Greek philosophy.In the second halfofthis book the impact ofIamblichus' Pythagoreanizing programme on his successors wasexamined in regard to212CONCLUSION</p></div><div id="pagenum"><p>some in ﬂuential members ofthe Platonic School at Athens. Use ofPythagorean literature in the philosophical</p></div><p id="page">curriculum can be observed in the case ofHierocles and elsewhere (see Appendix II). Syrianus knew Iamblichus' On Pythagoreanism and recommended it to his students. He shares Iamblichus' views on the nature and history of philosophy as the revelation ofwisdom by the pure soul ofPythagoras, whose inspiration was f ollowed especially byPlato and the Platonists and to some degree Aristotle. He ﬁnds thus in Aristotle's Metaphysics some truth concerning higher immaterial realities, but must correct Aristotle in terms ofa theory ofthe nature ofPythagoreanism, the majorsource ofwhich is Iamblichus. Syrianus' pupil Proclus shows similar tendencies, particularly in his early Commentary on the Timaeus, where he takes Plato's dialogue as expressing Pythagorean cosmology. However, Proclus also reacted critically to the Pythagoreanizing programme. He found the ﬁrstscienti ﬁcexpression oftruth, not (as Iamblichus had) among the ancient Pythagoreans, but in Plato's dialogues. In consequence Plato supplants Pythagoras as the centralauthority in Proclus' writings. Furthermore, although fully accepting the pivotal role played by mathematics in thephilosophical sciences, Proclus modi ﬁes this role in various ways. Geometry, rather than arithmetic, is chosen as the pre-eminently mediatory mathematical science, on account ofits discursive, demonstrative method. Proclus thusassimilates geometric to scienti ﬁc method and gives to his philosophical work in physics and metaphysics a marked geometrical aspect. He also insists on the subordination ofmathematics to the science ofthe divine, dialectic ortheology, in such a way as to make clear the inadequacy ofPythagorean mathematical imagings ofthe divine. Thisrequires, however, a de ﬁnite concept ofthe science ofthe divine as supposedly communicated in Plato's writings, a</p><div id="pagenum"><p>concept that is largely inspired, both in regard to the method and contents ofdialectic, by Proclus' view ofthe structureand contents ofmathematics. The originality ofthese important f eatures ofProclus' philosophy cannot, I believe, beadequately appreciated ifno ref erence is made to their background as a reaction to Iamblichus' Pythagoreanizingprogramme.In conclusion I would like to address a question that can scarcely be ignored: Why did Iamblichus seek toPythagoreanize Platonic philosophy? Why did he attempt to reformulate this philosophy as the revelation of truth tothe ancient Greeks by a divine soul? This question takes on greater importance ifwe suppose that it concernsCONCLUSION 213</p></div><div id="pagenum"><p>not just the internal history ofGreek philosophy but also the broader intellectual patterns ofthe period. OughtIamblichus' project to be seen in the light ofthe political success and the increasing theoretical sophistication ofanother revealed truth, Christianity? Is Iamblichus' ﬁgure ofPythagoras the pagan response and counterpart to Christ?</p></div><p id="page">Certainly the pagan philosophers oflate Antiquity were very aware ofthe threat that Christianity represented f or them.Already in the second century Celsus had attacked the pretensions ofChristians that their religion was the ancientwisdom that had inspired Greek philosophers. Porphyry, who attacked under Plotinus' direction various gnostic sects,wrote a critique ofChristianity that was all the more dangerous than Celsus's in that it was based on a superiorphilological, historical, and philosophical competence. Perhaps in Plotinus and certainly later in Proclus there are veiledreferences to Christianity. 526However, it would be dif ﬁcult to show, on the basis ofthe extant remains of On Pythagoreanism, that Iamblichus had Christianity speci ﬁcally in mind as a target against which his Pythagoreanizing programme was to be directed. At most one could point to structural parallels between his ﬁgure ofPythagoras (his divine authority, attributes, mission, words and deeds among men) and Christ.There is, however, another hypothesis that I would like to suggest, one that is perhaps less attractive, but that canappeal to some evidence. In speaking ofthe relations between Iamblichus and his teacher Porphyry above (p. 25) Ihave recalled the f act that many ofIamblichus' works were rebuttals ofspeci ﬁc writings ofPorphyry. Iamblichus seems to have been concerned to an unusual degree with establishing himselfby attacking and out-trumping his f ormerteacher. Now one ofPorphyry's major philosophical works was his Lifeand edition ofPlotinus. Indeed the industry Porphyry displayed in publishing Plotinus' work, summarizing it for beginners (in the Sentences ) and commenting extensively on it (the commentaries are no longer extant) suggests that the promotion ofPlotinian philosophy was oneofPorphyry's major interests. The Lifeand edition ofPlotinus were not, as indicated above in the Introduction, a work merely oferudition, but were designed to invite, introduce, and lead the reader up to the highest truths in a systematicway through the portrayal ofPlotinus as ideal philosopher and the reordering ofPlotinus' treatises in an anagogicseries. But this is also the purpose and structure ofIamblichus' work On Pythagoreanism : it too invites the214 CONCLUSION</p><div id="pagenum"><p>526Cf. Saffrey (1975).</p></div><div id="pagenum"><p>reader to philosophy through the ﬁgure ofPythagoras and leads him up through the successive stages ofPythagorean</p></div><p id="page">philosophy, the ﬁnal stage being reached, not in the work itself, but in a Pythagorean theology. We may then suppose</p><div id="pagenum"><p>that here, as in other instances, Iamblichus reacted to and sought to outdo the work ofhis master. Porphyry's systemofPlotinian philosophy would be supplanted by a doctrine off ar greater antiquity and authority, a doctrine that wouldinclude the texts ofPlato and Plotinus as subordinate, the doctrine ofPythagoras. Ifthis was indeed the intention ofIamblichus' Pythagoreanizing programme, we must allow that it had some success. For it played a considerable role,along with Porphyry's edition ofPlotinus, in the history oflater Greek philosophy. And Iamblichus' successors couldofcourse come to consider his Pythagorean theology as a revelation ofmuch greater antiquity and purity than that ofthe Christians.CONCLUSION 215</p></div><div id="pagenum"><p>This page intentionally left blank </p></div><p id="page"></p><div id="pagenum"><p>This page intentionally left blank </p></div><div id="pagenum"><p>AppendixITheExcerptsfromIamblichus'OnPythagoreanism</p></div><p id="page">V–VIIinPsellus:Text,Translation,andNotes The text ofPsellus' works On Physical Number and On Ethical and Theological Arithmetic which I published in 1981 is reprinted here.527Information concerning manuscripts, principles of the edition, and other textual matters may be found in O'Meara (1981) and in the discussion of the manuscript tradition of Nos. 4 –6 in Psellus, Philosophica minora II.

Given the nature ofPsellus' texts, the English translation makes no pretence at elegance. For translation ofGreek mathematical terms I have followed the ‘Glossary ’in D'Ooge et al.(1926), 291 ff., where references to explanations ofthese terms may be f ound.

But ifyou only knew ofthe variety ofnumber, you would have asked me about intelligible,essential, and ideal number. For number ofthis 〈latter〉kind is truly the highest and ﬁrst. Mathematical number is seen in common concepts. Physical number is found in the lowest things, things generated and divided in bodies. Forthe principles mixed in bodies, both in animals and plants, are physical numbers, for each of these is born, grows, anddies at determinate times. | And the philosopher should ﬁt the appropriate numbers to the causes in nature.| And since form is, in nature, the ﬁrst and most important cause (for the being of all depends on it), thus such numbers as provide being to nature and are essential, these are connatural with forms. Physical numbers of the formal type are:all odd numbers, numbers properly called ‘perfect ’, symmetric numbers such as multiples and superparticulars, ordered numbers such as square and cubic numbers. The beauty in numbers, which shows in their symmetry; the self‐sufﬁciency that is apparent in perfect numbers; the generativeness seen in 〈the numbers 〉seven and nine; the power that is observed especially in the tetractys ; the primacy that is found in the one; and the identity, purity, and paradigmatic character appearing in the ﬁrst numbers; and the equality that may be seen in square number; all ofthese 〈properties 〉ﬁt physical cause as form.| Since matter is an important cause in nature, we will ﬁnd it in physical numbers by taking all the opposites ofthe numbers we have mentioned as regards formal causes. The numbers then that are appropriate to matter are those thatare even, imperfect, differentiating, dissimilar, and all others such as are in opposition to formal numbers.|There is an ef ﬁcient cause in physical numbers: one may see this in the generative numbers shown in animal generation. | And the principle of movement according to difference and inequality in numbers shows an ef ﬁcient</p><div id="pagenum"><p>cause. | But this is especiallyAPPENDIX I 219</p></div><div id="pagenum"><p>220 APPENDIX I</p></div><p id="page"></p><div id="pagenum"><p>220 APPENDIX I</p></div><div id="pagenum"><p>manifest in the rotations and the revolutions of the heavens. And the stars' con ﬁgurations in relation to each other,</p></div><p id="page">their periodic revolutions, all oftheir shapes, their powers, are contained in the principles ofnumbers. And the moon'sphases, the order ofthe spheres, the distances between them, the centres ofthe circles which carry them, numberscontain them all. Indeed the measures ofnumbers determine health; crises in sickness are completed according todeterminate numbers; deaths come thus also, nature having ful ﬁlled the appropriate measures ofchange. | Hence number is generative ofanimal lif e. For since animals are made up ofsoul and body, the Pythagoreans say soul andbody are not produced from the same number, bu t soul from cubic number, body from the bomiskos . For, they say, 〈soul's〉being is from equal times the equal equal times, coming to be in equality, whereas body is a bomiskos , produced from unequal times the unequal unequal times. For our body has unequal dimensions: its length is greatest,its depth least, its breadth intermediate. Thus soul, as they say, being a cube from the number 6 (which is perfect),comes to be equal an equal times the equal as in the cube 216, for this is 6 by 6 by 6. But body, being from unequalsides an unequal times the unequal an unequal times, is neither dokisnorplinthis but a bomiskos , having for sides 5, 6, 7: for 5 by 6 is 30, and 7 by 30 is 210. Thus seven ‐month births occur in 210 days, having a complete body. Ifthen the soul alone were generated, it would be born in 216 days, a perfect cube being completed with its coming. But since theanimal is made ofsoul and body, 210 days are appropriate to the completion ofthe body: the generation ofthe bodydominates in the animal. | Thus soul desires equality, the body relates to anomaly and inequality. | The ancientsthought altars should have all dimensions unequal. |Since nature seems to form especially by change, one must show how physical number has change. The causes ofchange then relate to the dyad, the even, the heteromecic and suchlike (generally whenever indeterminateness is found in</p><div id="pagenum"><p>numbers, there change appears), difference and inequality (one is like a relation and property, which is rest, the other adifferentiating and unequalizing, such that it is not the different and unequal that are in change, but those madedifferent and unequal). |APPENDIX I 221</p></div><div id="pagenum"><p>222 APPENDIX I</p></div><p id="page"></p><div id="pagenum"><p>222 APPENDIX I</p></div><div id="pagenum"><p>And the power ofthe unlimited and ofthe limiting is both in nature and in physical number.

For ifnumber contains bodies and all extension, in the very same way it contains in itselfthe place that accompanies bodies, not as ifby touch but by incorporeal power. | And the places ofeach number areordered according to the serial 〈order〉 . For some numbers are by nature and order odd and even, whereas some are by nature odd and by order even. | And then again places are most in ﬂuential in the generation ofthings in the assimilation ofthe generated to them. |Neither in nature nor in physical number is there void. Its paradigm would be nothing other than lack ofharmony andlack ofsymmetry. But lack ofsymmetry is banished f rom nu mbers, unless one wishes to speak ofeven number as a discontinuous gap. |Now I know these are forceful demonstrations of physical number. We agree with what the ancients say and pass themon to you as for the most part right. For we do not accept completely what concerns animal generation: there areother principles ofsoul's being and body's making, demiurgic but not arithmetic. OnEthicalandTheologicalArithmetic As there are numbers ﬁtting nature, so there are ﬁtting〈ethical〉habits. And as there is a physical, so there is an ethical arithmetic. | The principle ofall ethical philosophy is measure itselfand the measured in the being ofnumbers,which is a pre ‐eminent principle in all ethical ordering. After the one principle there are other principles of all ethical philosophy, such as limit, the perfect (for perfection unitarily completes the best measure of life), then the order innumbers which ﬁts ethical good ordering, then the uniform and similar to the one, such as is seen either in the tetrad,</p><div id="pagenum"><p>hebdomad, or decad. | ThereAPPENDIX I 223</p></div><div id="pagenum"><p>224 APPENDIX I</p></div><p id="page"></p><div id="pagenum"><p>224 APPENDIX I</p></div><div id="pagenum"><p>is further as a model of good character the mean which binds together the difference in numbers, making allharmonious, producing all proportions, and making the soul into something well ‐adjusted. |</p></div><p id="page">Soul's powers are related to number forms. For the intellect is the one as unitary, science is 2 because it knows withcause, opinion is plane number, sensation solid number because it perceives solid bodies. | The decad contains theethical principles in us. | Life according to intellect contains limit, and, suitable also, the hebdomad, for it is unitary.And the hebdomad, like intellectual activity, neither generates another equal to the decad by multiplication nor is bornofanother. |Ifthe f orm ofvirtue is de ﬁned by a measured and perfect life, mean and perfect numbers ﬁt natural virtue, superabundant and de ﬁcient〈numbers〉〈 ﬁt〉excesses and de ﬁciencies in relation to virtue. | And one must assign the opposites ofwhat we give to virtue to vice: lack ofmeasure and ofharmony, the dif f erentiating, the unequal,unlimited, and such ‐like.

Fitting temperance, cause of symmetry, is 9 which is multiplied from the triad, for if all square numbers produce equality, those produced from odd numbers are the best for producing equality, and of these the ﬁrst is the square from the triad, 9, which comes from two perfect numbers, the 3 and 6, according to the ﬁrst perfect</p><div id="pagenum"><p>number, the 3, perf ected completely and as a whole.

And 5 is the ninth part ofsummation ofthe numbers goingfrom the monad to the ennead. Such then is arithmetic in ethics.|The philosopher Iamblichus wrote an arithmetic ofhigher natures, not treating ofthe numbers in themmathematically, nor imaging the higher kinds through analogies, nor positing them as hypostatic, self ‐moved, intellectual, or essential numbers, but he says 〈that〉as the genus ofhigher 〈natures〉transcends all being, so is their number absolute and ofitself .|Speaking of the difference between the good and the one, he says that as the nature of the good is generative, beingprior as cause to all goods, progresses in itself, and multiplies, thus the complete cause of the one ﬁlls all from itself, holds beings in itself, and multiplies in itself.|Suitable and appropriate to the higher kinds is the higher kind ofmathematical number, such as the one, limit, thedeterminate, equal, and such ‐like. | As there is a physical cause ofphysical numbers, an ethical f or ethicals, thus of divine number there is a uniform divine principle, prior as cause to the causes in all numbers, a uniform unitypre‐existing even all divine uni ﬁed number itself. | The ﬁrst then, the one properly speaking, God as wewould say, is henad and triad (for the triad unrolls the beginning, middle, and end around the one); and the intelligible and brightestmonad ascends to the highest cause; and the supercelestial ofthe 〈monad?〉leader of〈cosmic〉order; and the earthly, indivisible in the divided, full in the lacking. | There is a divine dyad, unlimited power, never failingprogression oflif e, receiving the measure ofthe ﬁrst one.

However, the importance ofthe two Arabic texts could hardly be gauged so long as they remained unedited anduntranslated. N. Linley's edition and translation ofthe commentary attributed to Proclus have now made this textaccessible, and it has already been discussed in an important article recently published by L. G. Westerink (1987).Before his death Linley had also prepared a provisional incomplete typescript draft of a translation of the commentaryattributed to Iamblichus. However an edition and complete translation are still lacking. In this Appendix I shall venturesome remarks about the Iamblichus text and propose a few comments additional to Westerink's ﬁndings concerning the Proclus commentary. In the former case I depend on Linley's provisional and incomplete translation, and what Isuggest must in consequence be regarded as tentative. I.TheCommentaryontheGoldenVersesAttributedtoIamblichus An incomplete text ofthis commentary survives in one manuscript ofthe thirteenth century now at Princeton. Linleytranslates its title thus: ‘A Commentary, compiled from the book of Iamblichus, on the “Exhortations ”ofthe philosopher Pythagoras ’. Linley indicates (in his edition ofthe Proclus commentary, v) that this text, as opposed to the Proclus commentary, uses the standard Arabic translation ofthe Golden Verses. The two texts appear also otherwise to have little in common, excepting some moral platitudes, a similar exegesis at the end oftheir comments on verses59–60, and some points to be mentioned shortly. In general the Iamblichus commentary does not show any close dependence either on Hierocles or on Iamblichus' exegesis in Protrepticus, ch. 3 (exceptions noted below), and gives the impression ofbeing little more than a series ofglosses on and paraphrases ofthe Golden Verses. Where the commentary is fuller, it gives expression to rather banal moral ideas. I do not think, however, that this text can be regarded simply asMuslim (or perhaps Christian) glossing ofthe Golden Verses, for there are signs of some dependence on Greek</p><div id="pagenum"><p>Neoplatonic exegesis ofthe Golden Verses.</p></div><div id="pagenum"><p>The clearest indication ofthis is the articulation ofthe commentary into an ethical and political section, ending with theexegesis ofverse 45, and a theoretical section on the divine and on man that f ollows. Westerink (1987), 68, has notedthe occurrence ofthis articulation in the Arabic commentary attributed to Proclus and in Hierocles (cf . In carm. 84,</p></div><p id="page">7–9). Another articulation is found in our Arabic Iamblichus at verses 54 –8 where the exegesis marks a transition from physics to the topic ofchoice ( πϱοαίϱɛσις), a transition marked also in the corresponding part ofIamblichus' Protrepticus (12, 1 –9), but not in Hierocles and in the Arabic Proclus commentary. One might note ﬁnally some traces in the Arabic Iamblichus text ofvulgarized Neoplatonism: the conception ofsouls that have f reed themselves f rom thematerial world as wise and divine beings (on verses 1 –2)—enough is said here to indicate that the hierarchy ofsouls (heroic, demonic, and divine) developed by Iamblichus, Hierocles, and Proclus is in question —and emphasis on the unchanging immaterial being ofthe divine and on the divine intellect in man that reminds him ofhis superior originand nature (on verses 46, 49 –51, 61 –5). Ifthis evidence suggests that the commentary depends ultimately on some Greek Neoplatonic original, it does notsufﬁce, however, to determine how seriously the attribution in the title ofthe commentary to Iamblichus should be taken. Such an attribution is not impossible, allowance being made for many omissions and later additions in the textofthe commentary. But at present at any rate there is little that could con ﬁrm the attribution. 2.TheCommentaryontheGoldenVersesAttributedtoProclus Another Arabic commentary on the Golden Verses, transmitted also by a single manuscript, consists ofextracts made by Ibn at Tayyib (eleventh century) entitled: ‘The essentials ofthe treatise ofPythagoras known as “the Golden ”. Proclus' commentary ’. (On the manuscript and on at Tayyib, cf. Linley's edition.) The major points made by Westerink (1987) might be summarized as follows. (i) The commentary —a larger and much more interesting work than the Arabic commentary attributed to Iamblichus —follows a Neoplatonic Greek model, excepting some Muslim (or Christian) modiﬁcations. For it demonstrates a familiarity with Pythag oras' biography and with Plato's dialogues that goes beyond the commonplace. Westerink also shows the presence in it ofspeci ﬁc Neoplatonic doctrines, two ofwhich will be discussed below, namely the hierarchy of gods, demons, heroes, and souls, and a hierarchy of different kinds ofnumber. (ii) On the question ofthe attribution ofthe commentary to Proclus, Westerink explores the variouspossibilities. Arabic bibliography knows ofa Commentary on the Golden Verses by Proclus, but this information maybe</p><div id="pagenum"><p>based on the text under discussionAPPENDIX II 231</p></div><div id="pagenum"><p>here. Greek bibliographies do not assign such a commentary to Proclus. However, the Sudalists as works ofa certain</p></div><p id="page">Proclus Procleius ofLaodicea a theology, a commentary on the Golden Verses, a commentary on Nicomachus, and various geometrical works. Westerink shows that this Proclus ofLaodicea, a Neoplatonist ofthe end ofthe f ourthcentury or slightly later, is not to be identi ﬁed with Proclus the successor ofSyrianus in the school ofAthens. It is possible then that the author ofthe Greek original ofthe Arabic text is either ofthese two Procluses or perhapsanother Greek Neoplatonist whose work came to be attributed to ‘Proclus ’. At present it does not appear to be possible to go further than this on the question of attribution to Proclus. If theArabic text corresponds indeed to the commentary by Proclus ofLaodicea, it would constitute another example oftheinﬂuence ofIamblichus' Pythagoreanizing programme. In the light ofthis programme the f act that this Proclus wrote on the Golden Verses, on Nicomachus, and on geometry does not appear to be merely coincidental. Furthermore the Arabic text contains passages ofparticular interest with regard to Iamblichus' Pythagoreanism. One passage (19),speaking ofthe hierarchy ofgods, demons, and heroes, describes heroes as f ollows: Heroes are souls which have passed lives as humans, and have remained with humans without becoming polluted,and were causes oftheir goods. Westerink (1987), 67, compares this to Iamblichus and in particular to the unpolluted souls in Proclus. In Iamblichus,as we have seen, such pure souls are especially signi ﬁcant as corresponding to the great philosophical benefactors of mankind, including ofcourse Pythagoras. However, the Arabic text does not establish this correspondence. Anotherinteresting passage in the Arabic text (77 –9) introduces numerological speculations and in particular a hierarchy of different kinds of number: Theﬁrst numbers are characteristic of the gods, the second represent the intelligible forms that are found in all that exists, the third are representations ofsoul . . . the fourth are representations of natural objects, in keeping with matter and its ordering by form. Westerink refers to another such classi ﬁcation in Proclus. But it is already an important theme in Iamblichus' On Pythagoreanism, as we have seen. The Arabic commentary thus contains ideas characteristic ofIamblichus' Pythagoreanizing programme which reappear in Syrianus and in Proclus. Ifthen the precise authorship ofthe Arabiccommentary cannot yet be determined with certainty, it can at least be seen as further evidence of the in ﬂuence of</p><div id="pagenum"><p>Iamblichus' revival ofPythagoreanism.232APPENDIX II</p></div><div id="pagenum"><p>Bibliography</p></div><p id="page">I.AncientAuthorsListed below are the editions I have used in citing ancient authors (cited by page and line numbers, unless otherwiseindicated).
