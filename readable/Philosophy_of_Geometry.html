In the 17th and 18th centuries it provided a paradigm of  knowledge after which some thinkers tried to pattern their own  metaphysical systems. But after the discovery of non-Euclidean  geometries in the 19th century, the nature and scope of geometry  became a bone of contention. Philosophical concern with geometry  increased in the 1920's after Einstein used Riemannian geometry in  his theory of gravitation. During the last fifteen or twenty years,  renewed interest in the latter theory -prompted by advances in  cosmology -has brought geometry once again to the forefront of  philosophical discussion.  The issues at stake in the current epistemological debate about  geometry can only be understood in the light of history, and, in fact,  most recent works on the subject include historical material. In this  book, I try to give a selective critical survey of modern philosophy of  geometry during its seminal period, which can be said to have begun  shortly after 1850 with Riemann's generalized conception of space  and to achieve some sort of completion at the turn of the century with  Hilbert's axiomatics and Poincare's conventionalism. The philosophy  of geometry of Einstein and his contemporaries will be the subject of  another book.  The book is divided into four chapters. Chapter 1 provides back­ ground information about the history of science and philosophy.  Chapter 2 describes the development of non-Euclidean geometries  until the publication of Felix Klein's papers 'On the So-called Non­ Euclidean Geometry' in 1871-73. Chapter 3 deals with 19th-century  research into the foundations of geometry. Chapter 4 discusses  philosophical views about the nature of geometrical knowledge from  John Stuart Mill to Henri Poincare.  Modern philosophy of geometry cannot be separated from in­ vestigations concerning fundamental geometrical concepts which  have been conducted by professional mathematicians in what are </p><div id="pagenum"><p>xi </p></div><div id="pagenum"><p>xii PREFACE </p></div><p id="page">usually considered to be purely mathematical terms. Thus the work of  Bernhard Riemann, Sophus Lie and Moritz Pasch plays a prominent  role in the history we shall recount. I have often resorted to 20th­ century mathematical concepts for clarifying the thoughts of 19th­ century mathematicians. Though this procedure can be questioned  from a strictly historical point of view, I find that it favours our  philosophical understanding. The Appendix on pp.359ff. defines  many of the mathematical concepts used and tells where to find a  definition of the rest.  Paragraphs preceded by an asterisk (*) contain supplementary  remarks which are generally more important than those relegated to the  Notes, but which nevertheless may be omitted without loss of  continuity.  References to the literature are given throughout the book in an  abbreviated manner. A key to the abbreviations is furnished in the  Reference list on pp.420ff. The latter also acknowledges my obliga­ tion to many of the writers from whom I have learned. I offer my  apologies to those I have omitted, either through inadvertence or  because their works were not directly relevant to the present subject.  In writing this book I have been helped by many persons to whom I  am deeply grateful. My greatest debt is to Professor Mario Bunge.  Plans for the book were examined by him at several stages of its  development, and it is clear to me that without his encouragement and  advice the book would never have been written. In the course of writing  it, I have discussed many difficult or controversial passages with Carla  Cordua and the final text owes much to her sound philosophical  judgment. Professor Hans Freudenthal has given me his advice on  one particular question I submitted to him and has kindly sent me  copies of some of his remarkable contributions to geometry and its  history and philosophy. The publisher's referees pointed out several  mistakes which I hope have been removed. Professors Millard  Hansen and Michael Reck and Mr Robert Blohm read substantial  parts of the manuscript and have greatly contributed to improve my  English. I also owe many valuable indications on style to Dr D.l. Larner.  Of course, none of the persons mentioned can be held responsible for  the errors which will doubtless still be found in the book, for I have  retained many of my views and idioms notwithstanding their objections.  Professors Ramon Castilla, Gerhard Knauss and Pedro Salazar, Miss </p><div id="pagenum"><p>Carola Rosa, Mrs losefina Santiago and Mr Christian Hermansen have, </p></div><div id="pagenum"><p>PREFACE xiii </p></div><p id="page">at different places, traced and obtained for me some of the sources on  which my research rests.  The book was written from September 1974 to July 1976. During  half that time, I enjoyed a sabbatical leave; during the other half, I  held a John Simon Guggenheim Memorial Fellowship. The John Simon  Guggenheim Memorial Foundation has also awarded a subsidy for the  publication of the book. I am happy to record my gratitude to the  University of Puerto Rico and the John Simon Guggenheim Memorial  Foundation for their generous support.  Isla Verde (Puerto Rico), July 1978  In the new hardbound and paperback editions I have corrected several  errors and misprints found in the original edition of 1978. I wish to  thank Dale Johnson, John Lucas, David Malament, John S. Pot and  Jose Pedro Ubeda, who pointed out some of them to me. However, I  could introduce no changes involving more than a few lines at a time.  Hence, the false assertion on page 350, line 10 from below, which mars  the entire construction it was meant to serve, remains untouched.  Fortunately, Dale Johnson, who detected it, has provided a valid  alternative construction which does the job for which mine was  intended. (See D. M.

The long  history leading to the discovery of non-Euclidean geometry will be  summarized in the first sections of Chapter 2. The present chapter  touches upon other aspects of the historical background of our  subject, which will be useful in our subsequent discussions. In the  first three sections of this chapter, we shall deal with the Greek  beginnings of geometry and philosophy, the uses of geometry in  Greek and early modern natural science, and the metaphysics of  space that was part and parcel of the accepted view of nature from  the 17th to the 19th century. In the fourth and last section, we shall  discuss the method of coordinates introduced by Rene Descartes for  describing geometrical configurations and relations in space.  1.0.1 Greek Geometry and Philosophy  Geometry and philosophy are still called in English and other modern  languages by their Hellenic names and for our present purposes we  need not seek their origins beyond ancient Greece. It is true that the  Greeks themselves liked to trace their sciences back to Oriental  sources, and they credited several of their great philosopher­ geometers with educational trips to the Middle East. The priestly  establishments of the Egyptian and Mesopotamian civilizations had  long enjoyed the kind of leisure which Aristotle regarded as a  prerequisite of the quest for knowledge,1 and had developed a variety  of notions about things in general which no doubt provided a stimulus  and a starting-point for the speculations of the Greeks. But all this  traditional Oriental wisdom was quite foreign to the self-assertive, yet  self-critical and argumentative method of free individual inquiry the  Greeks called philosophy. On the other hand, while the extant  monuments of Egyptian mathematics do not suggest that the Greeks  could have learnt much from them, Babylonian problem-books of the </p><div id="pagenum"><p>17th century B.C. bear witness to a remarkable algebraic ability and </p></div><div id="pagenum"><p>2 CHAPTER 1 </p></div><p id="page">sophistication. Cuneiform texts have also been found which apparently  presuppose acquaintance with the fundamental theorem of Euclidean  geometry generally known as the Pythagorean theorem. However, the  explicit statement of such general propositions is consistently avoided,  at least in the documents which have survived, and no attempt is made to  order mathematical lore in deductive chains. Yet it is mainly because of  the universal scope and the necessary concatenation of its statements  that geometry has time and again commanded the attention of philoso­ phers, challenging their epistemological ingenuity and exciting their  ontological imagination. It is therefore not unjustified, in a book on the  philosophy of geometry, to ignore pre-Greek mathematics and to  assume naIvely that both philosophy and geometry were born together,  say, in the mind of Thales the Milesian, about 600 B.C. Thales, at any  rate, was reportedly the first thinker to derive all things from a single  perennial material principle and also the first to demonstrate geometrical  theorems.2  It is very likely that the first geometrical demonstrations consisted  of diagrams that plainly exhibited the relations they were intended to  prove. A good example of this kind of demonstration is given in the  mathematical scene in Plato's Meno, in which Socrates leads a young  uneducated servant to see that the square built on the diagonal of  another square is twice as large as the latter.3 It is not difficult to  understand how one can arrive at general conclusions by looking at  particular diagrams. An intelligent look is not overwhelmed by the  rich fullness of its object but pays attention only to some of its  features. Any other object which shares these features will also share  all those properties and relations which are seen to go with them  inevitably.4 However, Greek geometers developed, fairly soon after  Thales, a different manner of proof, which does not depend on what  can be seen by looking at the disposition of lines and points in a  diagram or a series of diagrams, but rather on what can be gathered  by understanding the meaning of words in a sentence or a set of  sentences. s Scholars generally agree that one of the earliest instances  of this style of doing mathematics has been preserved almost intact in  Book IX, Propositions 21-34 of Euclid's Elements. These concern  some basic relations between odd and even numbers.6 Proposition 21  says that the sum of any multitude of even numbers is even because  each summand, being even, has an integral part which is exactly one </p><div id="pagenum"><p>half of it; hence, the sum of these halves is exactly one half of the </p></div><div id="pagenum"><p>BACKGROUND 3 </p></div><p id="page">sum of the wholes. Proposition 22 asserts that the sum of an even  multitude of odd numbers is even, because each summand minus a  unit is even, and the sum of the subtracted units is also even, so that  the full sum can be represented as a sum of even numbers. These  results lead to the following elegant proof of Proposition 23:  If as many odd numbers as we please be added together, and their multitude be odd, the  whole will also be odd. For let as many odd numbers as we please, AB, BC, CD, the  multitude of which is odd, be added together; I say that the whole AD is also odd. Let  the unit DE be subtracted from CD; therefore the remainder CE is even. But CA is also  even; therefore the whole AE is also even. And DE is a unit. Therefore AD is odd.?  Though this and the preceding proofs are plainly meant to be illus­ trated by diagrams in which the integers under consideration are  represented by straight segments (Fig. 1), such diagrams will not in  the least aid us to visualize the force of the argument. This rests  entirely on the meaning of the words odd, even, add, subtract, and  cannot therefore 'be seen except by thought'.8 Had they not adopted  this method of exact, forceful, yet unintuitive thinking, Greek  mathematicians could never have found out that there are incom­ mensurable magnitudes, such as, for example, pairs of linear seg­ ments which cannot both be integral mUltiples of the same unit  segment, no matter how small you choose this to be. For, as B.L. van  der Waerden pointedly observes:  When we deal with line segments which one sees and which one measures empirically,  it has no sense to ask whether they have or not a common measure; a hair's breadth  will fit an integral number of times into every line that is drawn. The question of  commensurability makes sense only for line segments which are objects of thought.9  The incommensurability of the side and the diagonal of a square  was discovered in the second half of the 5th century B.C. An early  proof, preserved in Proposition 118 of Book X of Euclid's Elements,1O  is directly linked with the theory of odd and even numbers in Book  IX. The discovery of incommensurables, a fact which plainly eludes,  and may even be said to defy, our imagination, must have powerfully  contributed to bring about the preponderance of that decidedly in­ tellectual approach to its subject matter which is perhaps the most  remarkable feature of Greek geometry. Such an approach was indeed  A B c EO  I ! </p><div id="pagenum"><p>Fig. I. </p></div><div id="pagenum"><p>4 CHAPTER I </p></div><p id="page">unavoidable if, as we have just seen, one of the most basic certainties  concerning the objects of this science could only be attained by  reasoning. After the discovery of incommensurables, geometers were  bound to demand a strict proof of every statement in their field (if  they were not already inclined to do so before). Now, if a statement  can only be proved by deriving (inferring, deducing) it from other  statements, it is clear that the attempt to prove all statements must  lead to a vicious circle or to an infinite regress. It is unlikely that  Greek mathematicians had a clear perception of the inadmissibility of  circular reasoning and infinite regress before Aristotle. But they  instinctively avoided these dangers by reasoning always from  assumptions which they did not claim to be provable. In a well-known  passage of the Republic, Plato speaks disparagingly of this feature of  mathematical practice: Since geometry and the other mathematical  disciplines are thus unable to give a reason (logon didonai) for the  assumptions (hupotheseis) they take for granted, they cannot be said  to be genuine sciences (episternai).11 The name science, bestowed on  them out of habit, should be reserved for dialectic, which "does away  with assumptions and advances to the very principle (auten ten  arkhen) in order to make her ground secure". 12 Having been born too  late to benefit from Plato's oral teaching, I find it very difficult to  determine how he conceived of the dialectician's ascent to the unique,  transcendent principle which he claimed to be the source of all being  and all truth. His great pupil, Aristotle, succeeded in disentangling  Plato's main epistemological insights from his mystical fancies and  built a solid, sober theory of science that has tremendously influenced  the philosophical understanding of mathematics until quite recently.  In Aristotle's terminology, science (episterne) is equated with know­ ledge by demonstration (apodeixis ).13 But it is subordinated to a  different kind of knowledge, which Aristotle calls nous, a word that  literally means intellect and that has been rendered as rational in­ tuition (G.R.G. Mure) and as intuitive reason (W.D. ROSS).14 Nous  gives us an immediate grasp of principles (arkhai), that is, of true,  necessary, universal propositions, which cannot be demonstrated­ except, I presume, by resorting to their own consequences -but  which are self-evident and provide the ultimate foundation of all  demonstrations in their respective fields of knowledge. Intellection of  principles is attained by reflecting on perceived data, but it is </p><div id="pagenum"><p>definitely not an effect of sense impressions modifying the mind. It </p></div><div id="pagenum"><p>BACKGROUND 5 </p></div><p id="page">results rather from the spontaneous mental activity that extricates  from the mass of particular perceptions the universal patterns that  shape them and regulate them. Aristotle, guided perhaps by his sane  Greek piety, readily acknowledged that there were many principles.  He distinguished two classes of them: axioms (axiomata), which are  known to all men and are common to all sciences because they hold  sway over all domains of being, and theses (theseis), which are proper  to a particular science. 15 The foremost example of an Aristotelian  axiom is the principle of contradiction: "The same attribute cannot at  the same time belong and not belong to the same object in the same  respect" .16 Theses are classified into hypotheses Chupotheseis), that  posit the existence or inexistence of something, and definitions  Chorismoi), that say what something is.17 Since circles and infinite  regress are no more admissible in definitions than in demonstrations,  there must be undefined or primitive terms in every deductive  science. There are some indications that Aristotle was aware of this,  but he never made this requirement fully explicit. 18  It is very likely that Aristotle developed his theory of science  prompted by his understanding of the work of contemporary mathe­ maticians, who sought to organize geometry as a deductive system  founded on the least possible number of assumptions. These men  were the forerunners of Euclid, whose famous Elements, written  about 300 B.C., are, in a sense, the fruit of their collective efforts.  Euclid's book, on the other hand, has been regarded since late  Antiquity as a showpiece of Aristotelian methodology. However, I am  not sure that it was originally understood in this way. In particular, it  is not at all clear to me that Euclid and his mathematical predecessors  actually viewed the unproved assumptions on which they built their  deductive systems as true, necessary, self-evident propositions. My  doubts are nourished mainly by the philological analyses of K. von  Fritz and A. Szabo, who have exhibited significant discrepancies  between the terminology of Euclid and that of Aristotle;19 but they  also draw support from philosophical considerations.  The first book of Euclid's Elements begins with a list of assump­ tions classed as horoi (definitions), aitemata (postulates or demands)  and koinai ennoiai (common notions). Additional horoi are given at  the beginning of Books II, III, IV, V, VI, VII and XI. The rest of the  Elements consists of propositions and problems which are supposedly </p><div id="pagenum"><p>proved and solved by means of these assumptions. This structure is, </p></div><div id="pagenum"><p>6 CHAPTER I </p></div><p id="page">of course, strongly reminiscent of Aristotle's blueprint for a deductive  science, a fact that is not surprising, since Euclid's work was prob­ ably fashioned after earlier books of 'elements' with which Aristotle  himself was familiar. Though Euclid does not call his three kinds of  assumptions by the same names chosen by Aristotle for his three  types of principles, it seems natural to equate horoi with horismoi,  koinai ennoiai with axiomata and aitemata with hupotheseis.  However, as soon as one examines Euclid's list one cannot help  feeling that there must be something wrong with these identifications.  Let us take a look at the three parts of that list.  (a) Though Euclid's horoi are far from satisfying the requirements  imposed on definitions by modern logical theory, they do agree with  Aristotelian horismoi in so far as each one of them declares, in  ordinary language sometimes mingled with previously defined tech­ nical terms, the nature of the objects designated by a given expres­ sion. Some horoi are overdetermined, providing alternative logically  non-equivalent characterizations of the same object. Such over­ determination, which makes a horos into a synthetic statement,  reporting factual information of some sort, would be of course  inadmissible in a definition in our modern sense, but may very well  occur in an Aristotelian horismos that says what something is. On the  other hand, horismoi are not supposed to make existential statements.  There is, however, a horos in Euclid which, though it is not ostensibly  a statement of existence, is invoked in a proof as if it had existential  import. This is Definition 4 in Book V, which says that "magnitudes  are said to have a ratio to one another which are capable, when  multiplied, of exceeding one another". This means that whenever two  magnitudes a, b, such that a is less than b, do have a ratio to one  another, there exists a number n, such that a taken n times is greater  than b. Since Definition 4 in Book V does not say that there are  magnitudes which actually have a ratio to one another, it does not  seem to have any existential implications. But in the proof of Pro­ position 1 in Book X it is assumed as a matter of course that any two  unequal but homogeneous magnitudes (two lengths, two areas, etc.)  do have a ratio to one another in the sense of Definition 4 in Book V,  and that consequently the smaller one will exceed the larger one when  mUltiplied by a suitable number. The existence of such a pair of  magnitudes results immediately from Postulates 1 and 2 (quoted </p><div id="pagenum"><p>below under (c)), as soon as we are given two points, but these </p></div><div id="pagenum"><p>BACKGROUND 7 </p></div><p id="page">postulates cannot, by any stretch of the imagination, be understood to  involve the existence of a number such as we described above. This  existential assumption must be regarded as implicit in Definition 4 in  Book V, as this horos is conceived and used by Euclid.  (b) The list of nine or more koinai ennoiai given in the extant  manuscripts of Euclid has been reduced to the following by modern  text criticism:  (1) Things which are equal to the same thing are also equal to one  another.  (2) If equals are added to equals, the wholes are equal.  (3) If equals are subtracted from equals, the remainders are equal.  (4) Things which coincide when superposed on one another are  equal to one another.  (5) The whole is greater than the part.20  In his Commentary on the First Book of Euclid's Elements, Proclus  gives this same list, but under the heading axiomata. Szabo con­ jectures that this, and not koinai ennoiai, was the term originally  employed by Euclid himself. This does not imply that he used axiom a  in its technical Aristotelian sense, since the word, as Aristotle noted,  was current among mathematicians.21 The five statements above are  'common' indeed in the sense that most people would readily ac­ knowledge them, but they are not common to all domains of being.  The first three and the fifth apply at any rate to the whole Aristotelian  category of quantity and may therefore be regarded as axioms ac­ cording to some passages in Aristotle.22 But the fourth is a specifically  geometrical statement and most probably refers only to figures which  can be drawn on a plane.  (c) The aitemata or postulates read as follows:  Let it be postulated: [I) to draw a straight line from any point to any point; and [2] to  produce a straight line continuously in a straight line; and [3] to describe a circle with  any centre and distance; and [4] that all right angles are equal to one another; and [5]  that, if a straight line falling on two straight lines make the interior angles on the same  side less than two right angles, the two straight lines, if produced indefinitely, meet on  that side on which are the angles less than the two right angles.2J  Is aitema just another name for that what Aristotle called hupo­ thesis? This, as the reader will recall, is a self-evident statement of  existence concerning the subject-matter of a particular science. The  five aitemata listed above all pertain specifically to geometry. The </p><div id="pagenum"><p>fifth can be read as an existential statement.24 The first three, on the </p></div><div id="pagenum"><p>8 CHAPTER I </p></div><p id="page">other hand, merely demand that certain constructions be possible (i.e.  performable in a presumably unambiguous manner, so that there is,  for example, only one way of joining two given points by a straight  line). Now, though Greek mathematicians and philosophers would  have generally agreed that any existing geometrical entity ought to be  constructible, this does not imply that every constructible entity must  be regarded as existing. Thus, Aristotle's solution of Zeno's  paradoxes depends essentially on the premise that, even though a  point can always be determined which divides a given segment into  two parts in any assigned proportion, such a point need not exist  before it is actually constructed.25 We cannot therefore view the first  three Euclidean postulates as straightforward existential statements in  an Aristotelian sense. Postulate 4, finally, is not existential in any  sense whatsoever.26 Those who have regarded Euclid's geometry as  an Aristotelian science have usually considered the first four aitemata  to be self-evident; but, as we shall see in Part 2.1, the self-evidence of  the fifth has often been disputed. It is. at any rate, doubtful that  Euclid would have used the expression eitestho to introduce what he  held to be self-evident truths.27 If a proposition is self-evident one  need not beg one's reader to grant it. The shades of meaning which  an educated Greek of the 4th or the 3rd century B.C. would have  associated with that expression can be gathered from Aristotle's own  use of the related noun aitema. In agreement with what apparently  was the customary meaning of these words in dialectics, he contrasts  a item a and hupothesis. "Any provable proposition that a teacher  assumes without proving it, provided that the pupil accepts it, is a  hypothesis; not a hypothesis in an absolute sense, though, but only  relatively to the pupil." An aitema, on the other hand, is "the contrary  of the pupil's opinion, or any provable proposition that is assumed  and used without proof". 28  In the light of the foregoing remarks, it appears unlikely that Euclid  ever regarded his threefold list of assumptions as an inventory of  principles in the sense of Aristotle. The common notions he probably  judged to be true and even necessary. But I do not believe that the  same can be said of the postulates. Some of these are incompatible  with the cosmological system developed by Aristotle in good  agreement with contemporary astronomy. In the closed Aristotelian  world not every straight line can be produced continuously, as </p><div id="pagenum"><p>required by Postulate 2, and not every point can be the centre of a </p></div><div id="pagenum"><p>BACKGROUND 9 </p></div><p id="page">circle of any arbitrary radius, as demanded by Postulate 3. Moreover,  though Postulate 5 is trivially true in such a world (because the  condition that the two lines be produced indefinitely cannot be  fulfilled), in the absence of Postulate 2 it cannot yield its most  significant consequences. Now, there is no reason to think that Euclid  and his immediate predecessors would have opposed the new  cosmology, which was indeed at that time a very reasonable scientific  conjecture. It would rather seem that, as Aristotle once remarked,  Greek mathematicians did not care to determine whether their basic  premises were true or no1.29 I dare say they assumed them, as  mathematicians are wont to do, because of their fruitfulness, that is,  their capacity to support a beautiful and expanding theory. Nineteen  centuries later, as we shall see below, implicit faith in the literal truth  of Euclidean geometry powerfully aided the shift "from a closed  world to the infinite universe" and the establishment of the metaphy­ sics of space that was such an important ingredient of the scientific  world-view from 1700 to 1900.  * Aristotle was well aware that his finite universe might appear to be  incompatible with geometry. But, in his opinion, it was not. "Our  account does not rob the mathematicians of their science", he writes,  "by disproving the actual existence of the infinite in the direction of  increase ... In point of fact they do not need the infinite and do not  use it. They postulate only that the finite straight line may be  produced as far as they wish. It is possible to have divided in the  same ratio as the largest quantity another magnitude of any size you  like. Hence, for the purposes of proof, it will make no difference to  them to have such an infinite instead, while its existence will be in the  sphere of real magnitudes." (Aristotle, Phys., 207b27-34). Aristotle is  wrong, however. Let m be a line and P a point outside it, and let  (P, m) denote the plane determined by P and m. In a finite world there  are infinitely many lines on (P, m) which go through P and do not  meet m even if they are produced as far as possible. This fact, which  is incompatible with Euclidean geometry, cannot be disproved by  reducing alI lengths in some fixed proportion, as Aristotle suggests.  On the other hand, Aristotle's system of the world is based on the  geometrical astronomy of Eudoxus (p.13ff .). This does not make it  inconsistent, however, because the geometry of Eudoxian planetary  models is that of a spherical surface, which does not depend on the </p><div id="pagenum"><p>Euclidean postulates that are false or trivial in the Aristotelian world. </p></div><div id="pagenum"><p>10 CHAPTER I </p></div><p id="page">Such two-dimensional spherical geometry is not really non­ Euclidean -as some philosophical writers claim (Daniels (1972),  Angell (1974» -for it does not rest on the denial of any Euclidean  postulate; but it does not presuppose the full Euclidean system and is  compatible with its partial negation. See Bolyai, SAS, p.21 (§26).  1.0.2 Geometry in Greek Natural Science  Pythagoras of Samos (6th century B.c.), or one of his followers,  discovered that musical instruments that produce consonant sounds  are related to one another by simple numerical ratios. Encouraged by  this momentous discovery, the Pythagoreans sought to establish other  correspondences between numbers and natural processes. They  believed, in particular, that celestial motions stood to one another in  numerical relations, producing a universal consonance or 'cosmic  harmony'. Since, as they observed, "all other things appeared in their  whole nature to be modelled on numbers",JO they concluded that "the  elements of numbers were the elements of things".3!  The Pythagorean programme for an arithmetical physics came to a  sudden end when one member of the school- possibly Hippassus of  Metapontum -discovered the existence of incommensurables, that is,  of magnitudes which can be constructed geometrically but stand in no  conceivable numerical proportion to one another. Since this fact can  be rationally proved but cannot be empirically verified (p.3), it is all  the more remarkable that it should have sufficed to stop the search for  numerical relations in nature, so promisingly initiated by the  Pythagoreans. I surmise that they unquestioningly took for granted  that bodies, their surfaces and edges, as well as the paths they  traverse in their motions, must be conceived geometrically. Hence,  they had little use for arithmology in physics after they learned that  not all geometrical relations can be expressed numerically.  One of the major achievements of classical Greek mathematics was  the creation of a conceptual framework permitting the exact quan­ titative comparison of geometrical magnitudes even if they happen to  be incommensurable. This is set forth in Book V of Euclid's Ele­ ments, which is generally believed to be the work of Eudoxus of  Cnidus (c.408-c.355 B.C.), a contemporary and friend of Plato.  Eudoxus' basic idea is stunningly simple, as is often the case with </p><div id="pagenum"><p>great mathematical inventions. It applies to all kinds of magnitudes or </p></div><div id="pagenum"><p>BACKGROUND 11 </p></div><p id="page">extensive quantities which can be meaningfully compared as to their  size and can be added to one another associatively (e.g. lengths,  areas, volumes). Let a and b be two such magnitudes, which fulfil the  following conditions: (i) a is equal to or less than b; (ii) there exists a  positive integer k such that ka (that is, a taken k times) exceeds b.  Any two magnitudes that, taken in a suitable order, agree with this  description will be said to be homogeneous. Let ai, b' be another  pair of homogeneous magnitudes of any kind. We say that a is to b in  the same ratio as a' is to b' (abbreviated: alb = a'Ib') if, for every  pair of positive integers m, n, we have that  rna < nb whenever ma' < nb',  rna = nb whenever ma' = nb',  rna > nb whenever ma' > nb'.  We say that a has to b a greater ratio than a' has to b' (alb> a'Ib')  if, for some pair of positive integers m, n, we have that rna> nb, but  ma' ::;;;; nb'.32 Using these definitions, we can compare the quantitative  relations between any pair of homogeneous magnitudes with that  between two straight segments. Eudoxian ratios are linearly ordered  by the relation greater than; they can be put into a one-one order  preserving correspondence with the positive real numbers and one  can calculate with them as with the latter. The importance of  Eudoxus' innovation fof geometry is evident and demands no further  comment. It also has a direct bearing on the Pythagorean programme.  This had failed because there are relations between things which  cannot possibly correspond to relations between numbers. But even if  numbers and their ratios were inadequate for representing every  conceivable physical relation, one could still expect Eudoxian ratios  to do this job. After all, the same reasons that had initially supported  physical arithmology could be used to justify the project of a more  broadly-conceived mathematical science of nature. In fact, Eudoxus  himself, as the founder of Greek mathematical astronomy, set some  such project going at least in this branch of physical inquiry. And, in  the following centuries, Archimedes of Syracuse (287-212 B.C.) and a  few others made lasting contributions to statics and optics. But in his  pioneering search for a mathematical representation of ordinary ter­ restrial phenomena, Archimedes -"suprahumanus Archimedes", as </p><div id="pagenum"><p>Galilei would call him -did not gather much of a following until the </p></div><div id="pagenum"><p>12 CHAPTER I </p></div><p id="page">17th century A.D. Greek astronomy, on the other hand, constituted a  strong scientific tradition that lasted almost uninterruptedly from  Eudoxus' time to the end of the 16th century A.D. But as astronomi­ cal theory was perfected and developed into the supple predictive  instrument used by Ptolemy (2nd century A.D.), it also became  inconsistent with the then current understanding of physical proces­ ses. Geometry was used to compute future occurrences from past  observations but was not expected to give an insight into the work­ ings of nature. Thus notwithstanding its auspicious beginnings, Greek  science did not persevere in the pursuit of the modified Pythagorean  programme that Eudoxus' theory of ratios clearly suggested.  It is somewhat puzzling that the Greeks should have failed to  develop a mathematical physics commensurate with their scientific  curiosity and ability. I suspect that this can be traced in part at least  to the intellectual influence of Plato. The last statement may sound  surprising, since Copernicus, Kepler, and GaIiIei professed great  admiration for Plato and often drew inspiration from his writings. Yet  the fact remains that Plato took a stand, clearly and resolutely,  against the very possibility of a mathematical science of nature, in a  well-known passage of the Republic, which the founders of modern  science apparently chose to ignore. perhaps because they felt that it  did not apply to a world created ex nihilo by the Christian God. The  passage in question occurs in a long discussion of a statesman's  education. Would-be rulers ought to be drawn away from the fleeting  sense appearances that capture a man's attention from birth, towards  the immutable intelligible principle whence those appearances derive  their meagre share of being and of value. The conversion of the soul  begins with the study of mathematics. Although the mathematical  sciences sorely need a 'dialectical' foundations Cp.4), they do procure  us our first contact with genuine, that is, exact and changele~s, truth.  The vulgar believe that mathematical statements are about things we  touch or see; but such things lack the permanence and, above all, the  definiteness proper to mathematical objects. These are not ideas, in  Plato's sense, for there are many of a kind (e.g. many circles), but  they are not mere appearances, like the objects we perceive through  our senses. They stand somewhere in between but nearer to the  former than to the latter. Plato displays a hierarchy of mathematical  sciences. After arithmetic, or the science of number, comes geometry, </p><div id="pagenum"><p>both plane and solid. The science of solids as such (auta kath 'auta) is </p></div><div id="pagenum"><p>BACKGROUND 13 </p></div><p id="page">followed naturally by the science of solids in motion. Plato calls it  astronomy, but he warns his readers that this mathematical science of  motion has nothing to do with the stars we see twinkling in the sky,  although it bears their name.33  We should use the broideries in the heaven as illustrations to facilitate that study, just  as we might employ, if we met with them, diagrams drawn and elaborated with  exceptional skills by Daedalus or some other artist (demiourgos); for I take it that  anyone acquainted with geometry who saw such diagrams would indeed think them  most beautifully finished, but would regard it as ridiculous to study them seriously in  the hope of gathering from them true relations of equality, doubleness, or any other  ratio. [ ... J Do you not suppose that a true astronomer will have the same feeling when  he looks at the movements of the stars? He will judge that heaven and the things in  heaven have been put together by their maker (demiourgos) with the utmost beauty of  which such works admit. But he will hold it absurd to believe that the proportion which  night bears to day, both of these to the month, the month to the year, and the other  stars to the sun and moon and to one another can be changeless and subject to no  aberrations of any kind, though these things are corporeal and visible; and he will also  deem it absurd to seek by all means to grasp their truth. J4  Plato obviously countenances a purely mathematical theory of  motion, which it would be more appropriate to call kinematics or  phoronomy. He conceives it quite broadly. "Motion -he says­ presents not just one, but many forms. Someone truly wise might list  them all, but there are two which are manifest to us. ,,35 One is that  which is imperfectly illustrated by celestial motions. The other is the  "musical motion" (enarmonios phora), studied by Pythagorean  acoustics. This science, says Plato, has been justly regarded as  astronomy's "sister science". Exact observation -not to mention  experiment -is completely out of place here too. Plato pours ridicule  on "those gentlemen who tease and torture the strings and rack them  on the pegs of the instrument" .36 Generally speaking,  if anyone attempts to learn anything about the objects of sense, I do not care whether  he looks upwards with mouth gaping or downwards with mouth shut; he will never, I  maintain, acquire knowledge, because nothing of this sort can be the object of a  science.J7  Plato's warning to would-be astronomers, that they should not  expect heavenly bodies to be excessively punctual, nor spend too  much effort in observing them in order to "grasp their truth" was  probably aimed at none other than young Eudoxus, who, while the  Republic was being written, attended Plato's lectures and perhaps </p><div id="pagenum"><p>mentioned his plan for a mathematical theory of planetary motions. </p></div><div id="pagenum"><p>14 CHAPTER I </p></div><p id="page">Eudoxus did not follow the philosopher's advice. He developed a  kinematical model of each 'wandering star' or planet (including the  sun and the moon), which could be used to predict its movements  with a good measure of success. All Eudoxian models are built on the  same general plan. The planet is supposed to be fixed on the equator  of a uniformly rotating sphere whose centre coincides with the centre  of the earth. The poles of this sphere are fixed on another sphere,  concentric with the former, which rotates uniformly about a different  axis. The poles of the second sphere are fixed on a third one, etc. This  scheme can be repeated as many times as you wish, but the last  sphere must, in any case, rotate with the same uniform speed and  about the same axis as the firmament of the fixed stars. Following  Aristotle, Eudoxian spheres are usually numbered beginning with this  one, so that the sphere on which the planet is fixed is counted last;  hereafter, we shall also follow this practice. 38 Eudoxus' models of  the sun and the moon had three spheres each, those of Mercury,  Venus, Mars, Jupiter and Saturn had four. His disciple Callippus added  two spheres to the sun, two to the moon and one to each of the first  three planets, in order to obtain a better agreement with observed  facts.  Eudoxus' models gave a first solution of the problem that was to  dominate astronomy until the Keplerian revolution. As stated by  Simplicius, the 6th-century commentator of Aristotle, this problem  consisted in determining "what uniform, ordered, circular motions  must be assumed to account for the observable motions of the  so-called wandering stars".39 The requirement that phenomena be  'saved' (that is, accounted for) by means of uniform circular motions  was usually justified saying that no other kind of motion could suit  the divine perfection of the heavens. But I wonder whether this was  really the motivation behind Eudoxus' spherical models. After all,  Plato's authoritative opinion should have induced his friend and pupil  to look for something a little less perfect. On the other hand, non­ circular non-uniform motions would have been practically intractable,  with the available mathematical resources, so that, as a matter of fact,  Eudoxus' choice of uniform circular motions was the only one he  could reasonably have made. His success was acknowledged by  Plato, who took a different view of astronomy in his old age. The  anonymous Athenian who is Plato's spokesman in the Laws bears </p><div id="pagenum"><p>witness to this change. </p></div><div id="pagenum"><p>BACKGROUND 15 </p></div><p id="page">It is not easy to take in what I mean, nor yet is it very difficult or a very long business:  witness the fact that, although it is not a thing which I learnt when I was young or very  long ago, I can now, without taking much time, make it known to you: whereas, if it  had been difficult, I, at my age, should never have been able to explain it to you at  yours. [ ... J This view which is held about the moon, the sun, and the other stars, to the  effect that they wander and go astray (planatai), is not correct, but the fact is the very  contrary of this. For each of them traverses always the same circular path, not many  paths, but one only, though it appears to move in many paths.  The whole path and movement of heaven and of all that is therein is by nature akin  to the movement and revolution and calculations of intelligence (no us ).«l  But Plato does not recant his former evaluation of nature and of the  prospects of natural science. He only concludes, in good agreement  with traditional Greek piety, that the heavens must be set apart from  the rest of the physical world. The planets would not follow those  "wonderful calculations with such exactness" if they were soulless  beings, destitute of intelligence.41 The same point is made more  explicitly in the Epinomis, a supplement to the Laws which many  20th-century scholars have attributed to Plato's pupil, the mathema­ tician Philip of Opus, but which in Antiquity was believed to be the  work of Plato himself.  It is not possible that the earth and the heaven, the stars, and the masses as a whole  which they comprise should, if they have no soul attached to each body or dwelling in  each body, nevertheless accurately describe their orbits in the way they do, year by  year, month by month, and day by day.42  The achievements of Eudoxian astronomy were thus used to justify a  complete separation of celestial from terrestrial nature. The former  could be described with mathematical exactitude because it is popu­ lated and ruled by rational souls. But it would be foolish to imitate the  mathematical methods of astronomy when we consider the clumsy,  unpredictable behaviour of the inanimate objects that surround us.  Eudoxian astronomy does not provide what Galilei or Newton  would have called a 'system of the world', because each planet is  treated independently of the others. But there are two features  common to all the planetary models, which can naturally serve to  unify them: (i) all spheres have the same centre, namely, the centre of  the earth; (ii) each model includes one sphere which rotates exactly  like the heaven of the fixed stars. These two features facilitated the in­ corporation of Eudoxian spheres into Aristotle's cosmology. Aristotle  maintained that there are five kinds of 'simple bodies', namely, </p><div id="pagenum"><p>fire, air, water, earth and aether. Each of these has a peculiar nature </p></div><div id="pagenum"><p>16 CHAPTER 1 </p></div><p id="page">(Phusis) or "internal principle of motion and rest". These bodies being  simple, their respective natures prescribe them simple motions: earth  and water move naturally downwards, i.e. towards the centre of the  world; fire and air, upwards, i.e. away from the centre; aether moves  neither downwards nor upwards, but in perfect circles about the  centre of the world. All things beneath the moon are combinations or  mixtures of the first four simple bodies in different proportions, and  are therefore more or less evenly distributed about the centre of the  world (hence this happens to be the centre of the earth as well). On  the other hand, aether is the only material ingredient of heaven.  Heaven consists of a series of concentric, rigid, transparent aethereal  spheres, eternally rotating with different uniform speeds, each one  about its own axis, which passes through the centre of the world. Since  the heavenly spheres are material, they must be nested into one another  like a Russian doll. The outermost sphere rotates once a day, from East  to West, about the North-South axis. Each of the remaining spheres has  its poles fixed on the sphere immediately outside it. Thus each sphere  induces its own motion on all the spheres contained in it. Luminous  ethereal bodies are fixed on some of the spheres. In fact, all except seven  are found on the outermost sphere, which is known for this reason as the  sphere of the fixed stars. The next three spheres move, respectively, like  the last three spheres in the Eudoxian model of Saturn, Saturn itself  being affixed to the equator of the third one. Then come three spheres  whose rotations cancel out those of the former three, so that a point on  the last one moves like a fixed star. The next three spheres move like the  last three spheres of the Eudoxian model of Jupiter, and Jupiter is affixed  to the last. Again, their rotations are cancelled by the motions of the  following three spheres. This scheme is repeated until we come to the  innermost sphere, which is the sphere of the moon. If we base our  construction on the planetary models of Callippus (p.14), the foregoing  scheme gives a total of 49 spheres.43 Each sphere is endowed with a  divine mind that keeps it moving in the same way for all eternity.  Although Aristotle did not hesitate to incorporate in his physical  cosmology the latest results of the new mathematical astronomy and  may even be said to have devised the former to fit the latter, he did  not countenance the use of mathematical methods in other branches  of physical inquiry. Physical science (episteme phusike) was no longer  for him, as it had been for Plato, a contradiction in terms. Indeed, his </p><div id="pagenum"><p>main concern was to develop a conceptual framework for the </p></div><div id="pagenum"><p>BACKGROUND 17 </p></div><p id="page">scientific study of the world of becoming as known through the  senses. He held in fact that there is no other world than this. But he  believed that a strict science is not necessarily an exact science, and  that only a boor can demand of a science more precision than its  subject matter will admit.44 All objects of sense are material in the  Aristotelian sense of this word, that is to say, they have a potentiality  for becoming other than they are. This, according to Aristotle, is a  source of indeterminacy, which must appear as an unavoidable im­ precIsion in scientific concepts. "Exact mathematical speech  (mathematike akribologia) is not to be demanded in all cases, but only  in the case of things which have no matter. Hence it is not the style of  natural science; for presumably the whole of nature has matter.,,45  This Aristotelian dictum would, if taken literally, exclude mathe­ matical exactness even from astronomy. But Aristotle does not ap­ pear to have suggested that, say, the heavenly spheres were only  approximately spherical or that their angular velocities were ap­ proximately constant. He probably thought that, since the aether is,  so to speak, minimally material- its materiality consisting merely in  its disposition to rotate perpetually in the same way about the same  point -aethereal things can take a simple geometrical shape and obey  a simple kinematic law. But such is not the case of the other material  things. Indeed, "physical bodies contain surfaces and volumes, lines  and points, and these are the subject matter of mathematics".46  Aristotle emphatically rejects the Platonic thesis that mathematical  objects are ideal entities, existing apart from their imperfect realiza­ tions in the world of sense. But mathematicians do separate them -in  thought -from matter and motion; and although "no falsity ensues  from this separation" (oude gignetai pseudos khorizonton)47 as far as  the abstract objects of mathematics are concerned, one cannot expect  that what is true of them will apply unqualifiedly to the concrete  objects of physics.  We must not fail to notice the mode of being of the essence [of the object of inquiry) and of  its concept, for without this, inquiry is but idle. Of things defined, i.e., of 'whats', some are  like 'snub' and some like ·concave'. And these differ because 'snub' is bound up with matter  (for what is snub is a concave nose), while concavity is independent of sensible matter. If  then, all physical objects (panta ta phusikal are to be conceived like the snub -e.g. nose,  eye, flesh, bone, and in general, animal; leaf. root, bark, and, in general, plant (for none of  these can be conceived without reference to motion -their concept always involves  matter) -, it is clear how we must seek and define the 'what' in the case of physical </p><div id="pagenum"><p>objects." </p></div><div id="pagenum"><p>18 CHAPTER 1 </p></div><p id="page">One might contend however that, by referring the natural motions of  the four sublunary elements to a dimensionless point, which is also  the centre of the heavenly spheres, Aristotle has prepared the ground  and implicitly granted the need for a geometrical approach to ter­ restrial physics. Thus, one could argue, if a lump of earth is dropped  right under the moon and there is nothing beneath it, it should move,  according to Aristotle, in a perfectly straight line towards the centre  of the world. This style of thinking is very familiar to us, but was  quite foreign to Aristotle. To someone proposing the foregoing  analysis he would probably have objected that, since a void cannot  possibly exist, the situation described, in which there is nothing  beneath our lump of earth, makes no physical sense. In real life, a  heavy body must always find its way to its natural resting place by  pushing aside other lighter bodies that stand in its path. This ensures  that its trajectory will never be rectilinear. Moreover, its actual shape  is utterly unpredictable, since it depends on the particular nature of  the obstacles that the falling body chances to meet.  The Aristotelian synthesis of mathematical astronomy and physical  cosmology broke down very soon, because the planetary models of  Eudoxus could not be reconciled with all observed facts. Sosigenes  (1st century B.C.) mentions two facts that were known to Eudoxus  himself, which his theory was incapable of explaining:  (i) The sun does not traverse all four quadrants of the Zodiac in the  same time -the period from a solstice to the next equinox is not equal  with that from that equinox to the other solstice; hence, the angular  velocity of the sun about the earth cannot be constant.  (ii) The apparent luminosity of the planets and the apparent size of  the moon are subject to considerable fluctuations; hence their  distances from the earth cannot be constant.  Callippus sought to cope with fact (i) by adding two more spheres to  Eudoxus' solar model, but fact (ii), of course, was totally in­ compatible with the Aristotelian system of concentric spheres. Third­ century astronomers managed to account, on a first approximation,  for both facts by assuming that each planet moves with constant  angular speed on an eccentric, that is, on a circle whose centre is not  the centre of the earth but which contains the latter in its interior.  Then. towards the end of that century, some hundred years after the </p><div id="pagenum"><p>death of Aristotle, Apollonius of Perga (265?-170 B.C.) introduced an </p></div><div id="pagenum"><p>BACKGROUND 19 </p></div><p id="page">extraordinarily pliable kinematical device: epicyclical motion. Let us  define:  A body moves with simple or first degree epicyclical motion if it  describes a circle (the epicycle) whose centre moves on another  circle (the deferent) about a fixed point.  A body moves with nth degree epicyclical motion (n > 1) if it  describes a circle (the nth epicycle) whose centre moves with  (n -1)th degree epicyclical motion.  nth degree epicyclical motion (n ~ 1) is said to be uniform if the  body moves with constant angular velocity about the centre of the  nth epicycle and the centre of the jth epicycle (1::; j ::; n) moves  with constant angular velocity about the centre of the (j -l)th  epicycle (or the centre of the deferent, if j = 1). Epicyclical motion  is said to be geocentric (heliocentric) if the centre of the deferent  coincides with the centre of the earth (sun).  Hipparchus (lst century B.C.) proved that the trajectory of any planet  moving with constant speed on an eccentric will also be described by  a body moving with a suitable geocentric uniform simple epicyclical  motion. A more breathtaking result, that neither Apollonius nor  Hipparchus could prove but that they have surmised, is that every  imaginable planetary trajectory can be approximated within any arbi­ trarily assigned margin of error by some geocentric uniform nth  degree epicyclical motion (where n is a positive integer generally  depending on the assigned margin of error).49 Epicyclical motion  furnishes, therefore, a general solution of the main problem of Greek  astronomy; to 'save the phenomena' by postulating 'uniform regular  circular motions' (p.14). This universal scheme can be adjusted to fit  any set of astronomical observations if one chooses the right  parameters. However, ancient and medieval astronomers never  availed themselves of the full power of Apollonius' invention. Both  Ptolemy (2nd century A.D.) and Copernicus (1473-1543), the two  acknowledged masters of epicyclical astronomy, postulated eccentric  deferents, thereby decreasing in one the number of epicycles needed  for each planetary model. Ptolemy also resorted to the infamous  hypothesis of the equant or 'equalizing point' (punctum aequans),  which he could, in principle, have dispensed with by suitably increas­ ing the epicycles. This hypothesis is applied by Ptolemy to all the  wandering stars except the sun. According to it, all circular motions </p><div id="pagenum"><p>involved in the epicyclical motion of the star are uniform, except that </p></div><div id="pagenum"><p>20 CHAPTER I </p></div><p id="page">of the centre K of the first epicycle. K moves on the deferent with  variable speed, but there is a fixed point A, the equant, such that the  line AK turns about A describing equal angles in equal times. The  star's epicyclical motion is therefore not uniform in the sense defined  earlier, and this deviation from 'Platonic' orthodoxy was indeed one  of Copernicus' chief complaints against Ptolemy. All equants postu­ lated by Ptolemy turn out to be collinear with the centre of the  respective deferent and with the centre of the earth. Due to the low  eccentricity of the earth's elliptical orbit, the Ptolemaic astronomer  could achieve a remarkably accurate representation of the trajectories  of the planets without having to postulate many epicycles. Let P  stand for Venus, Jupiter or Saturn, and let P' be a fictitious body  moving with simple epicyclic motion on an eccentric deferent about  the earth, with its angular velocity regulated by a suitably placed  equant. D.J. de S. Price has calculated that, if the riirameters are  chosen optimally, the predicted position of P' will always fall within  6' of arc of the observed position of P. This approximation compares  favourably with the best precision attained by naked eye astronomers  before Tycho Brahe (1546-1601). On the other hand, if P stands for  Mars, P' may deviate up to 30' from p.50  Epicyclical astronomy was the highest achievement of applied  mathematics before the advent of modern astronomy and modern  mathematical physics in the 17th century. In a sense, it may be said to  have cleared the way for them, insofar as it led to the development of  many useful mathematical techniques and fostered the habit of deal­ ing with time as with a magnitude or extensive quantity. But the aims  and what we might call the epistemic attitude of epicyclical  astronomy were diametrically opposed to those of 17th-century  science. Epicyclical astronomy produced kinematical models of the  planetary motions that could, in principle, be indefinitely adjusted to  account for new and better observations. But these models had not  the slightest semblance of physical plausibility. From this point of  view, epicyclical models compare unfavourably with Eudoxus'  homocentric spheres, which had been so aptly integrated by Aristotle  into an intelligible cosmos, nicely arranged about the centre of the  world. The many centres that regulate celestial motions in epicyclical  astronomy -the moving centres of the epicycles, the fixed but empty  centres of the deferents, the equants or centres of uniform angular </p><div id="pagenum"><p>velocities -are arbitrary geometrical points, altogether independent </p></div><div id="pagenum"><p>BACKGROUND 21 </p></div><p id="page">from the distribution of matter in the universe, and their dynamical  significance is all but transparent. Indeed, to anyone who views the  heavens as a ballet of angels, the intricate, geometrically sophisticated  evolutions of a Ptolemaic planet ought to appear as a worthier display  of divine choreography than Aristotle's artless merry-go-round. And  yet, many Greek thinkers of late Antiquity and most Arab and Latin  philosophers of the Middle Ages were wary of accepting the kinema­ tic models of epicycIical astronomy as a faithful picture of the real  motions of the stars and tended to regard them merely as compu­ tational device, i.e. as a formalism for predicting (or retrodicting) the  future (or past) positions of the heavenly bodies from observed data.  Forgetting or deliberately ignoring that Aristotelian cosmology was  itself largely based on the mathematical astronomy of an earlier age,  the Andalusian philosopher Averroes (c.1126-c.1198) rejected the  astronomical theories of his time because they clashed with the  teachings of the Philosopher.  The astronomer must construct an astronomical system such that the celestial motions  are yielded by it and that nothing physically impossible is implied. [ ... J Ptolemy was  unable to place astronomy on its true foundations. [ ... J The epicycle and the eccentric  are impossible. We must therefore apply ourselves to a new investigation concerning  that genuine astronomy whose foundations are the principles of physics. [ ... J Actually,  in our time, astronomy is non-existent; what we have is something that fits calculation  but does not agree with what is.sl  His Jewish countryman Maimonides (1135-1204) speaks more cau­ tiously:  If what Aristotle has stated with regard to natural science is true, there are no epicycles  or eccentric circles and everything revolves round the centre of the earth. But in that  case how can the various motions of the stars come about? [ ... J How can one conceive  the retrogradation of a star, together with its other motions, without assuming the  existence of an epicycle?s2  This 'perplexity' motivates Maimonides' agnosticism in astronomical  matters. The heavens are the heavens of the Lord but the earth hath  He given to the son of man. (Psalm 114: 16). Man can attain knowledge  of sublunary physics, but he cannot expect to grasp "the true reality,  the nature, the substance, the form, the motions and the causes of the  heavens", These can be known by God alone.53 A similar astronomi­ cal agnosticism must have been at the root of the 'as if' philosophy  professed by some late medieval Christian writers. John of Jandun (c. </p><div id="pagenum"><p>1286-c.1328) stated this viewpoint very neatly. According to him, an </p></div><div id="pagenum"><p>22 CHAPTER I </p></div><p id="page">astronomer need only know that if the epicycles and eccentrics did  exist, the celestial motions and the other phenomena would exist as  they do now.  The truth of the conditional is what matters, whether or not such orbits really exist  among the heavenly bodies. The assumption of such eccentrics and epicycles is  sufficient for the astronomer qua astronomer because as such he need not trouble  himself with the reason why (unde). Provided he has the means of correctly determin­ ing the places and motions of the planets, he does not inquire whether or not this means  that there really are such orbits as he assumes up in the sky [ ... J. For a consequence  can be true even when the antecedent is false.54  If we understand this passage literally, we shall conclude that in  landun's methodology, the epicyclical models employed by  astronomers for the calculation of celestial motions are only an aid to  knowledge, a sort of scaffolding required for attaining it, which  cannot claim to be true; but that the trajectories yielded by those  models, i.e. the predicted paths of the bodies that are assumed to  move epicyclically, are, or ought to be, the true trajectories of the  wandering stars. However, some Renaissance writers, who espoused  methodological principles akin to landun's, apparently understood  them in a more radical sense. Their words suggest that the mathema­ tical models of astronomy need not yield the true celestial tra­ jectories; it is enough that they enable us to predict the course of  each star in good agreement with its observed positions. This implies,  for instance, that a model for Mercury need not agree with the true  path of this planet except during the periods of maximum elongation  (maximum apparent separation from the sun), since it can be obser­ ved with the naked eye only at such times. One does not need to look  far to find the reason for this shift of meaning. landun is obviously  right if astronomy is content to give an accurate reconstruction of  celestial kinematics but does not provide a truly illuminating theory of  celestial dynamics. For only a theory that derives the actual motions  of the heavenly bodies from their natural properties will enable the  astronomer to choose between two kinematically equivalent devices,  such as two different combinations of epicycles and eccentrics that  yield the same trajectory. But if the astronomer lacks a dynamical  theory of celestial motions, he can only rely on actual observations  to distinguish between planetary models that predict different tra­ jectories. Consequently, in the absence of such a theory, astronomy </p><div id="pagenum"><p>cannot decide between the many discrepant kinematical hypotheses </p></div><div id="pagenum"><p>BACKGROUND 23 </p></div><p id="page">that happen to be observationally equivalent. A purely kinematic  astronomy, that aimed only at description and prediction, but left to  angelo logy the task of understanding astronomical phenomena, was  bound to lead to a retreat from truth.  1.0.3 Modern Science and the Metaphysical Idea of Space  Johannes Kepler (1571-1630), bent as he was on learning how things  really are, had to break away from this tradition. For him, astronomy  "is a part of physics, because it inquires about the causes of natural  things and events".55 It does not merely seek to foretell the changing  configurations of the heavens, but tries to make them intelligible.  "Astronomers should not be free to feign anything whatever without  sufficient reason. You ought to be able to give probable reasons for  the hypotheses you propose as the true causes of appearances.,,56 "I  offer a celestial physics or philosophy in lieu of Aristotle's celestial  theology or metaphysics" ,57 he proudly wrote to Brengger after  finishing the Astronomia nova. But Kepler's celestial physics is the  same as terrestrial physics. There is no essential difference between  heaven and earth. Hence, the astronomer's hypotheses concerning the  causes of what happens there can be tested here. Moreover, in order  to understand the phenomena in the sky, one must stop regarding the  stars as self-willed beings, and look for the analogies between their  behaviour and the more familiar processes of inanimate nature. "My  aim", Kepler wrote in 1605, "is to show that the fabric of the heavens  (coelestis machina) is to be likened not to a divine animal but rather  to a clock (and he who believes that a clock is animated attributes to  the work the glory that befits its maker, insofar as nearly all its  manifold motions result from a single quite simple, attractive bodily  force (vis magnetica corporaiis), just as in a clock all motion pro­ ceeds from a simple weight). And 1 teach how to bring that physical  cause under the rule of numbers and of geometry".58 Geometry is  indeed the key to universal physics. The mathematical analysis and  reconstruction of phenomena is our only source of insight into the  workings of nature. "God always geometrizes."s9 "We see that the  motions [of the planets] occur in time and place and that the force  [that binds them to the sun1 emanates from its source and diffuses  through the spaces of the world. All these are geometrical things. </p><div id="pagenum"><p>Must not that force be subject also to other geometrical necessities?,,60 </p></div><div id="pagenum"><p>24 CHAPTER I </p></div><p id="page">"Geometry furnished God with models for the Creation and  was implanted in man, together with God's own likeness.,,61 "God,  who created everything in the world according to the norms of  quantity, also gave man a mind that can understand such things. For  as the eye is made for colours, and the ear for sounds, so is the mind  of man created for the intellection, not of anything whatever, but of  quantities; and it grasps a subject the more correctly, the closer that  subject is to pure quantity.,,62 Similar thoughts were voiced in­ dependently, at about the same time, by Galileo Galilei (1564-1642)  and thereafter provided the methodological groundwork of early  modern science. None of these ideas was wholly new, but not until  the 17th century did they become the mainstay of a sustained syste­ matic search for comprehensive physical knowledge.  We need not dwell on Kepler's long laborious quest for the laws of  planetary motion, nor on the subsequent development of the new  science of nature. What interests us here is a far-reaching implication  of the ontological significance which Kepler and his successors  ascribed to geometry. If geometry furnished the model of God's  Creation and if "triangles, squares, circles, spheres, cones, pyramids"  are the characters in which Nature's book is written,63 then every  point required for the constructions prescribed by Euclid's postulates  must somehow exist. Neither Kepler nor Galilei drew this inference;  they both held to the Aristotelian belief in an outward limit of the  world, beyond which there is nothing. But Rene Descartes (1596- 1650) taught that "this world, or the entirety of the corporeal  substance has no limits in its extension", for "wherever we imagine  such limits we always not only imagine some indefinitely extended  spaces beyond them, but perceive those spaces to be real',.64 Indeed,  if a limit of the world existed, Descartes 'second law of nature' could  not be true. For according to this law, a freely moving body will  always continue to move in a straight line -thereby perpetually per­ forming the construction demanded by Euclid's second postulate­ and this would be impossible if every distance in the world were less  than or equal to a given magnitude. While Descartes cautiously  formulated his thesis saying that "the extension of the world is  indefinite" ,65 most scientists and philosophers after him did not hesi­ tate to proclaim the infinitude of extension -though they generally did  not equate extension with matter, as Descartes had done. </p><div id="pagenum"><p>The set of all points required by Euclid's postulates, endowed with </p></div><div id="pagenum"><p>BACKGROUND 25 </p></div><p id="page">all the mutual relations implied by Euclid's theorems, is known in  current mathematical parlance as Euclidean space. We may say,  therefore, that the assumption that geometry is the basis of physics  and that the world is a realization of Euclidean theory implies the  existence of Euclidean space. Since a structured point-set is not the  sort of thing that one would normally expect to exist 'really' or  'physically' as a self-subsisting entity, modern philosophy was beset  with a novel ontological problem, the problem of space, which  consisted in determining the mode of existence of Euclidean space.  This problem was not conceived at first in the clear-cut way in which  I have stated it. Not until the 19th century was the word 'space'  defined to mean a structured point-set, and even then philosophers  were not quick to adopt the new usage. Before that time, 'space'  (' spatium', 'Raum ') designated an immaterial medium in which the  points of geometry were supposed to be actually present or per­ haps only potentially discernible (somewhat in the manner in which  Aristotle had said that they could be distinguished as limits in material  things). The problem of space concerned therefore the ontological  status of this medium. Was it a construct, an ens rationis, abstracted  from matter by the thinking mind? Or did it enjoy real existence  independent of matter? The latter alternative need not imply that pure  space was a substance or self-subsisting entity, like mind or matter;  being immaterial, it could still be conceived as something somehow  inherent in the divine or in the human mind. In any case, all philoso­ phers bent on establishing the truth of mathematical physics on solid  grounds -and that includes Leibniz and Newton, Malebranche and  Kant -implicitly agreed that space was -in Poincare's words­ continuous, infinite, three-dimensional, homogeneous and isotropic,66  and that all the points contained or discernible in it satisfy the  theorems of Euclidean geometry.  This idea of space is certainly not a part of pre-philosophical  common sense. The habit of rendering the Greek words topos (place)  and kenon (void) as space has fostered the illusion that some such  idea was familiar to Greek philosophers. The only word in classical  Greek that can be regarded as equivalent to our word 'space' is khora,  in the special metaphysical sense in which it is used in Plato's  Timaeus (in ordinary Greek, khiJra meant 'land', 'territory', but also  'the space or room in which a thing is'); and even this equivalence is </p><div id="pagenum"><p>imperfect.67 Topos or 'place' cannot by any stretch of the philological </p></div><div id="pagenum"><p>26 CHAPTER 1 </p></div><p id="page">imagination be equated with what the moderns call 'space'. Place is  always the place of a body and, as any child knows, it is determined  by the body's relationship to other, usually adjacent bodies. Aristotle  proposed the following explication of this commonsense notion: The  place of a body surrounded or contained by another is "the boundary  of the containing body at which it is in contact with the contained  body".68 The place of a body is, according to this, a surface. The  Aristotelian philosopher Strato of Lampsacus (3rd century B.C.)  believed that the place of a three-dimensional body must also be  three-dimensional and defined it as the interval (diastema) between  the inner boundaries of the containing body.69 John Philoponus (6th  century A.D.), commenting on Aristotle's Physics, again introduced  this definition eight centuries later: "Place is not the boundary of the  containing body [ ... ], but a certain three-dimensional incorporeal  interval, different from the bodies that fall into it. It is the dimensions  alone, devoid of any body. Indeed, with regard to the underlying  reality, place and the void are the same.,,70 Strato must also have  suggested this identification of place with the void, at least on a  cosmic scale, for, according to our sources, he declared the void (to  kenon) to be "isometric" with the body of the world (to kosmikon  soma), so that "it is void indeed by its own nature, but it is always  filled with bodies, and only in thought can it be regarded as self­ subsisting" .71 Although this description is strongly reminiscent of the  modern idea of space as an empty receptacle which is occupied by  matter, I frankly do not think that we can regard Strato as the first  proponent of a concept of absolute space. Not only is his "void"  always full, but it is finite, like the "cosmic body" with which it is said  to coincide and from which it can be separated "only in thought".  F.M. Cornford (1936) ascribed the invention of the modern idea of  space to the 5th-century atomists Leucippus and Democritus, who  were the first to introduce the philosophical concept of the void (to  kenon). According to Cornford, these authors had sought to provide  thereby a physical realization of geometrical space. Though I  certainly approve of the philosophical purpose of Cornford's paper,  which is to show that the modern idea of space is a datable -and  dated -figment of philosophy, J am not persuaded by his historical  argument. The atomists who, like most 5th-century philosophers, had  been strongly impressed by Parmenides, contrasted the atoms and </p><div id="pagenum"><p>the void as "being" and "not-being", respectively, and never spoke of </p></div><div id="pagenum"><p>BACKGROUND 27 </p></div><p id="page">the former as of something that occupies a part of the latter. Since the  atoms are eternal and uncreated, there can be no question of their  'taking up' or 'being received by' the void. The void surrounds the  atoms and these move about in it: but the void is not conceived as an  underlying continuum that is partly empty and partly full. While the  atomists allowed the void to permeate the infinity of atoms, which  coalesced in infinitely many independent systems or kosmoi  (,worlds'), the Stoic school, founded towards 300 B.C. by Zeno of  Citium, maintained that there is but one kosmos, which is finite and  tightly packed with matter, and is surrounded by a boundless void  (kenon). The union of void and kosmos they called to pan, i.e. the All.  The Stoic All can be said to contain all the points demanded by  Euclid, but there is no evidence that the Stoics had geometry in mind  when they developed their doctrine.  A likelier antecedent of the modern connotations of 'space' can be  found in the use of spatium by Lucretius (98-55 B.C.) in his  didactic poem De rerum natura. Here, to kenon becomes "locus ac  spatium quod inane vocamus" (the place and space that we call  void -1,426, etc.). The adjective inanis ('empty', 'void') immediately  suggests the contrast with a "locus ac spatium plenum", a full place  and space. If this or a similar expression were used in the poem 1  would not doubt that Lucretius did conceive spatium as a medium  that was partly empty and partly filled with bodies. The best examples  I have chanced upon are line 1,522, where bodies are said to hold and  fill places, not space ("[corpora] quae loca complerent quacumque  tenerent"); and lines 1,526 f., which W.H.D. Rouse translates: "There  are therefore definite bodies to mark off empty space from full." The  last passage would satisfy my requirements if the translation were  exact. But Lucretius wrote  sunt ergo corpora certa  quae spatium pleno possint distinguere inane,  and it seems more natural to read plenum as a noun -'the full'­ standing for that which bodies are said to mark off from spatium  inane, 'the void'. On the other hand, several passages contrast, in the  best atomist tradition, body as such -not space occupied by body­ with the void, the empty void, empty space or simply space. But even  if Lucretius never meant to sing the modern idea of space, some of  his hexameters must have conjured it up in the minds of his modern </p><div id="pagenum"><p>readers.72 </p></div><div id="pagenum"><p>28 CHAPTER I </p></div><p id="page">Turning now to the medieval background of modern science and  philosophy, we find that the better-known scholastic writers believed  in the finite world and generally rejected the existence of the void  inside or outside it. However, some of them were led to countenance  its possibility by the consideration of divine omnipotence, which, they  granted, involved the power of annihilating the earth without altering  the heavens and of creating another world outside ours. The English  mathematician and theologian Thomas Bradwardine (c.1290-1349)  found a manner of providing all the points required by geometry by  lodging them in God's imagination. God must imagine the site of the  world before creating it; and since it is absurd to imagine a limited  empty space, what God imagines is the infinite space of geometry.  God is said to be eternally present in every part of this infinite  imaginary site. "Indeed, He coexists wholly and fully with infinite  magnitude and imaginary extension and with each part of it. ,m Hasdai  Crescas (1340-1410), a Catalonian rabbi, asserted the existence of an  infinite vacuum consisting of "three abstract dimensions, divested of  body". Such incorporeal dimensions "mean nothing but empty place  capable of receiving corporeal dimension", whereby it becomes the  place of a body.74 But not until the Italian cinquecento did such ideas  gain currency among Christian writers. The independent subsistence  of space as an infinite incorporeal receptacle for all bodies was a  common tenet of the natural philosophers Bernardino Telesio (1509- 1588), Francesco Patrizzi (1529-1597), Giordano Bruno (1548-1600)  and Tommaso Campanella (1568-1639). In Bruno's words, "space is a  continuous three-dimensional natural quantity, in which the magni­ tude of bodies is contained, which is prior by nature to all bodies and  subsists without them but indifferently receives them all, and is free  from the conditions of action and passion, unmixable, impenetrable,  unshapeable, non-locatable, outside all bodies yet encompassing and  incomprehensibly containing them all".7s  The most influential 17th-century solutions of the problem of space  are the relationist doctrine of Leibniz (1646-1716) and the absolutist  view favoured by English writers, that was incorporated by Newton  (1643-1727) into the framework of his mechanics. Leibniz charac­ terized space as the order of coexistence, meaning, I presume, that it  is nothing but a mathematical structure embodied in coexisting things  (or in their simultaneous states). Leibniz conceived this structure as </p><div id="pagenum"><p>resting entirely on distance, which he apparently regarded as a </p></div><div id="pagenum"><p>BACKGROUND 29 </p></div><p id="page">physical relation between coexistent things.76 Absolutists, on the  other hand, conceived of space as "infinite amplitude and  mensurability", existing by itself even "after the removal of corporeal  matter out of the world" and before the creation of such matter.77  Though this incorporeal entity could not be directly perceived,  Newton claimed that motion, or rather acceleration relative to it had  tangible effects on bodies.  The problem of space had an important role in the development of  Kant's critical philosophy. Kant (1724-1804), ever wary of Schwiir­ mere;, rejected real infinite pure self-subsisting space as an Unding,  that is, a non-entity or chimera.78 In his early writings, he upheld a  relationist theory of space. There would be no space, he wrote in  1746, if material particles were not the site of forces, with which they  act upon each other. For "without force there is no connection  (Verbindung), without connection there is no order and without order  there is no space".79 The dynamic interaction between the particles is  held responsible for the structural properties of space. Thus, the fact  that space has three dimensions follows from the fact that the forces  of interaction are inversely proportional to the square of the distance  between the interacting particles. (Note that young Kant, like Leibniz,  regards distance as a property of matter, prior to the constitution of  space.) This is a contingent fact. A different law of interaction would  yield a space having more or less than three dimensions. "A science  of all the various possible kinds of space would certainly be the  highest geometry that a finite understanding might undertake."so In  1768, however, Kant came to the conclusion that his relationist views  were untenable, because space, far from being an attribute of matter  or a construct derived from its consideration, was ontologically prior  to spatial things. Some essential properties of the latter, he argued,  depend on the manner of their imbedding in universal space.81 But  Kant would not naIvely accept the usual absolutist theory of space,  which, to his mind, was laden with absurd implications. He was  driven therefore to develop a radically new interpretation of the  ontological status of space (and of time).  Kant's ontology of space is, at the same time, an epistemology of  geometry. As such, it provided the starting-point and, so to speak, the  conceptual setting for many of the philosophical discussions of  geometry in the 19th century. We must therefore say a few things </p><div id="pagenum"><p>about it. Kant first presented his new philosophy of space and time in </p></div><div id="pagenum"><p>30 CHAPTER 1 </p></div><p id="page">the Latin dissertation On the fonn and the principles of the sensible  and the intelligible world (1770). It is, in fact, the core of the  platonizing theory of the principles of human knowledge outlined in  that work. The problems raised by this theory forced its abandonment  and led Kant to his vaunted revolution in philosophy. The theory of  space and time is presented in the Transcendental Aesthetic, the first  part of the Critique of pure reason (first edition, 1781; second,  revised, edition, 1787), almost in the same terms as in the Latin  dissertation. A consistent reading of Kant's critical philosophy  requires however that those terms be qualified in the light of the next  two parts, the Transcendental Analytic and the Transcendental  Dialectic. Since most philosophers, outside the narrow circle of Kant  specialists, have paid scarcely any attention to this requirement, the  straightforward, precritical philosophy of space and geometry  developed by Kant in 1770 has played a much greater role in the  history of thought than the subtler, more elusive doctrine that might  be gathered from the entire Critique of 1781 and 1787 and from his  other critical writings.  The doctrine of 1770 follows a familiar metaphysical scheme. The  human mind is regarded as a substance that interacts with other  substances. The capacity of the human mind to have its state of  consciousness (status repraesentativus) modified by the active  presence of an object is called sensibility (sensualitas). The  modifications caused thereby are called sensations. The modifying  object can be the mind itself or another substance; in the latter case,  it is said to be outwardly or externally sensed. s2 Sensations are a  source of knowledge of the sensed object; indeed, they are the only  source of direct knowledge of individual objects that is available to  man. Such knowledge by direct acquaintance is called by Kant  intuition (intuitus, Anschauung). Human knowledge of reality rests  therefore entirely on sense intuition. Intuitive knowledge of an object  is brought about by the combination of sensations arising from the  object's presence into a coherent presentation of the object itself.  Such a combination of sensations is governed by a "law inherent in  the mind"s3 of which space is a manifestation. For "space is not  something objective and real, neither a substance, nor an attribute,  nor a relation, but a subjective and ideal schema for coordinating  everything that is externally sensed in any way, which arises from the </p><div id="pagenum"><p>nature of the mind according to a stable law".84 We shall not discuss </p></div><div id="pagenum"><p>BACKGROUND 31 </p></div><p id="page">here the arguments given by Kant in support of this extraordinary  assertion. If they are valid, it follows at once that externally sensed  objects are spatial insofar as they are presented to us in sense  intuition, but that no spatial properties and relations need be ascribed  to them as they exist in themselves, independently of their presen­ tation to the human mind. Kant can therefore uphold the ontological  priority of space over bodies without having to admit "that inane  fabrication of reason",85 real self-subsisting empty infinite space.  We have an idea of universal space which is not, however, a  general concept under which all particular spaces are subsumed, but a  'singular representation' that comprises such spaces as its parts.  Moreover, in Kant's opinion, the idea of space cannot be fully  conveyed by concepts, since such spatial relations as the difference  between a glove and its mirror-image can only be felt, not understood.  He therefore calls our idea of space an intuition, although it obviously  does not acquaint us with a real object. It is said to be a pure  intuition, because it does not depend on the sensations that are  coordinated in space. Surprisingly enough, this non-conceptual idea,  which one would naturally expect to be ineffable, is said to be  manifest "in the axioms of geometry and in any mental construction  of postulates and problems".  That space has only three dimensions, that there is but one straight line joining two  given points, that a circle can be drawn on a plane about a given point with any given  radius, etc., these facts cannot be inferred (concludi) from some universal notion of  space, but can only be perceived (cemi) concretely in space itself.86  Geometrical propositions are therefore not logically true, and they  can be denied without fear of contradiction. Nevertheless, "he who  exerts himself to feign in his mind any relations different from those  prescribed by space itself, labours in vain, for he is compelled to  employ this very idea in support of his fiction".87 Kant obviously  assumed that "the relations prescribed by space itself" are those  stated in Euclid's Elements. He was persuaded that his new theory of  space guarantees and explains the objective validity of (Euclidean)  geometry, i.e. the alleged fact that this science, which is not nourished  by experience, is nevertheless true of every imaginable physical  object.  Nothing at all can he given to the senses unless it agrees with the primitive axioms of  space and their consequences (according to the prescriptions of geometry), even though </p><div id="pagenum"><p>their principle is purely subjective. Therefore, anything that is thus given will, if </p></div><div id="pagenum"><p>32 CHAPTER 1 </p></div><p id="page">self -consistent, necessarily be consistent with the latter, and the laws of sensibility will  be laws of nature insofar as it can be perceived by the senses (quatenus in sensus cadere  potes!). Hence nature complies exactly (ad amussim) with the precepts of geometry  regarding alI the properties of space demonstrated in this science, on the strength not of  a feigned presupposition (hypothesis), but of one that is intuitively given as the  subjective condition of alI phenomena that nature can exhibit to the senses."  Two aspects of the foregoing doctrine must be modified in order to  adjust it to Kant's mature philosophy. According to the latter, human  knowledge is restricted to the objects of sense, as they appear to us in  space and in time. Outside this context, no property or relation can be  cognitively predicated of anything. Therefore, the metaphysical  scheme of 1770 is no longer tenable. Space cannot be regarded as an  attribute of a substance, the mind, which coordinates the  modifications that this substance suffers through the action of other  substances. The philosophy of space and time must now rest on an  analysis of human experience and its presuppositions as revealed  from within. In the light of this analysis, ordinary self-awareness is  seen to presuppose the perception of objects in space. 89 Space does  not therefore depend on the human psyche, not at any rate as it is  known to us, through its phenomenal manifestation, since it is indeed  the latter that requires the prior availability of space. If objective  space still is said to be sUbjective it must be because of the 'egotistic'  or -sit venia verbo -self-like features of the process through which  space itself becomes manifest, of that "progress in time, [which] deter­ mines everything, and is not in itself determined by anything else".90  The second adjustment that must be introduced into the doctrine of  1770 in order to incorporate it into critical philosophy, is more  relevant to geometry. According to the Critique of pure reason all  connection (Verbindung) and hence all ordering of a manifold of  sense-data is the work of the understanding,91 and must therefore be  regulated by concepts. Hence, preconceptual intuitive space should  no longer be described as "that which causes the manifold of ap­ pearance to be intuited as ordered in certain relations", but rather as  "that which makes it possible that the manifold of appearance be  ordered in certain relations".92 This 'form of outer intuition' does not  therefore by itself possess the structure described by the propositions  of geometry. "Space, represented as object (as we are actually  required to do in geometry), contains more than the mere form of </p><div id="pagenum"><p>intuition. ,,93 </p></div><div id="pagenum"><p>BACKGROUND 33 </p></div><p id="page">Space is something so uniform and as to all particular properties so indeterminate, that  we should certainly not seek a store of laws of nature in it. Whereas that which  determines space to assume the form of a circle or the figures of a cone and a sphere, is  the understanding, so far as it contains the ground of the unity of their constructions.  The mere universal form of intuition, called space, is therefore the substratum of all  intuitions determinable to particular objects, and in it lies, of course, the condition of  the possibility and of the variety of those intuitions. But the unity of the objects is  entirely determined by the understanding."  Since Kant conceived the "manifold of a priori intuition" called  space, not as a mere point-set, but as a (presumably three-dimen­ sional) continuum, we must suppose that he would have expected  "the mere form of intuition" to constrain the understanding to bestow  a definite topological structure on the object of geometry. But, apart  from this, the understanding may freely determine it, subject to no  other laws than its own. Since the propositions of classical geometry  are not logically necessary, nothing can prevent the understanding  from developing a variety of alternative geometries (compatible with  the prescribed topology), and using them in physics.  Though this conclusion is clearly implied by the foregoing Kantian  texts it is unlikely that we would ever light on them if we did not  enjoy the benefit of hindsight, that is, if we had not been familiar with  the multiplicity of geometrical systems before reading Kant. When  the non-Euclidean geometries became a subject of philosophical  debate in the second half of the 19th century, the self-appointed  custodians of Kantian orthodoxy were among its fiercest opponents.  They dismissed the new geometries as interesting, possibly even  useful, intellectual exercises that had nothing to do with the true  science of space. For this science -as Kant had taught in 1770, and  again in the Transcendental Aesthetic of the Critique of pure reason  and in the chapter on pure mathematics in the Prolegomena -was  revealed through pure intuition in full agreement with the Elements of  Euclid.  1.0.4 Descartes' Method of Coordinates  The conception of space as a medium containing every point referred  to by the propositions of geometry, naturally motivates the view that  regards geometry as the science of space. If space is assumed to exist  somehow in rerum natura, it is almost inevitable to think of geometry </p><div id="pagenum"><p>as a natural science, that must determine its object in successive </p></div><div id="pagenum"><p>34 CHAPTER I </p></div><p id="page">approximations, under the guidance and control of experience. This is  a hard task indeed, for space is a shy god, who shuns the sight of his  believers.  The tendency to view geometry as the science of space was greatly  strengthened by Descartes' method of coordinates, which rev­ olutionized the treatment of geometrical problems and provided the  appropriate instrument for the description of the phenomena of  motion in modern physics. Descartes' method, introduced in his  Geometry (1637), may be roughly described as follows: Each point in  space is labelled with an ordered triple of (directed) lengths; their  relations can then be determined by investigating quantitative rela­ tions between their labels; every line and surface can be defined as  the locus of all points whose labels are related by a given equation.  Following this approach, the primary objects of geometry are points  and their relations, and it is reasonable to define geometry as the  science of space if the latter is equated with the set of its points or if  it is regarded as a medium that can be analyzed into them.  Descartes' method of coordinates probably contributed more than  anything else to shape the views on space and geometry of most  19th-century mathematicians. The two boldest conceptual innovations  of the 19th century that we shall subsequently have to discuss,  namely, Riemann's theory of manifolds (Sections 2.2.8ff) and Lie's  theory of continuous groups (Sections 3.1.4, 3.1.5), can be considered  in a sense as natural extensions of that method. It is important,  therefore, that we have a clear grasp of its foundations. The crucial  step in Descartes' method is the construction of an algebra of (direc­ ted) lengths. After this is secured, the labelling of points is an easy  and fairly obvious matter. We tend to take that step for granted,  because we regard directed lengths as real numbers, i.e. as the  elements of a complete ordered field. But Descartes did not have such  p.eat concepts at his disposal and had to work them out for himself. In  order to make his construction intelligible to contemporary readers, I  shall explain it in my own terms, in agreement with today's standards  of precision. But I shall avoid every assumption that does not seem to  be clearly involved by Descartes' procedure. Anyhow, the reader will  do well to take a look at Descartes' text in Book I of his Geometry.  We shall define an algebraic structure on the set of directed lengths  or, as we shall prefer to say, of directed linear magnitudes of </p><div id="pagenum"><p>Euclidean space. This structure will turn out to be that of an ordered </p></div><div id="pagenum"><p>BACKGROUND 35 </p></div><p id="page">field and, if a strong but historically plausible assumption is allowed,  that of a complete ordered field. Let m be a Euclidean straight line,  produced to infinity. We use capital letters A, B, C ... to denote  points on m. The reader is presumably familiar with the relation of  betweenness that holds for such points. This may be characterized as  follows:  (i) If B lies between A and C, then A#- B #-C #-A and B lies  between C and A.  (ii) If A #-C, there exist on m points- Band D, such that B lies  between A and C and C lies between A and D.  (iii) If A, B, C are three different points on m, one and only one of  them lies between the other two.  (iv) If AI> Az, A3, A4 are four different points on m, there is a  permutation (T of {l, 2, 3, 4} such that Au(2) lies between Au(1) and Au(3)  and also between Au(l) and Au(4)o while Au(3) lies between Au(l) and Au(4)  and also between A<T(2) and A<T(4)'  We shall assume that the Euclidean line m has the following property:  (D) If the points on m all belong to either of two mutually disjoint sets, at and a2,  which are such that whenever two points P and Q belong to the same set a; (i = 1,2)  every point lying between P and Q also belongs to a;, there exists a unique point X  which lies between each point in at -{X} and each point in a2 -{X}.  This is the strong assumption that I mentioned above. I said that it is  historically plausible because there is every reason to believe that  Descartes would have readily admitted it.95  Henceforth, we shall write b(ABC) for 'B lies between A and C'.  Let 0 and E be two fixed points on m. We shall refer to 0 as the  'origin'. We shall now define a linear order on the points of m.'!6 If X  and Yare two points of m such that X precedes Y in this linear order,  we write 'X < Y', The linear order is characterized by the following  three conditions:  (i) X < 0 if and only if b(XOE).  (ii) 0 < X if and only if b(OXE) or X = Ear b(OEX).  (iii) X < Y (X, Y #-0) if and only if X< 0 and b(XOY), or Y < 0  and b(XYO) or 0 < X and b(OXY).  An ordered pair (X, Y) of points on m will here be called a directed  segment. We denote it by XY. X and Yare, respectively, the first and  the last endpoint of XY. XY is positive if X < Y, negative if Y < X </p><div id="pagenum"><p>and null if X = Y. Two directed segments XV, X'Y' are congruent if </p></div><div id="pagenum"><p>36 CHAPTER 1 </p></div><p id="page">(K 1) they are both positive or both negative and the Eudoxian ratios  XY/OE and X'Y'IOE are equal, or if (K2) they are both null. These  definitions can be extended to any other Euclidean line m'. Choose  0' and E' on m' so that the Eudoxian ratio O'E'IOE equals  OE/OE. Define linear order on m' as before. Let.Jl be the set of all  Euclidean lines ordered in this way. Two directed segments belonging  to the same or to different lines of .Jl are said to be congruent if they  satisfy (Kl) or (K2). The reader ought to verify that congruence of  directed segments is an equivalence. A directed linear magnitude  (dIm) is an equivalence class of congruent directed segments. If XY is  any directed segment, we let [XY] denote the dIm to which it belongs.  [XY] is positive, negative or null if XY is, respectively, positive,  negative or null. It will be easily seen that, for every point X on an  ordered line m, each dim has one and only one member whose first  endpoint is X and whose last endpoint lies on m. In par .. icular, this is  true of the origin O. Consequently, as X ranges over the set of points  of m, [OX] ranges over the set of dIm's. Let X and Y be points of m.  We say that [OX] is less than rOY] (abbreviated: [OX] < rOY]) if and  only if X < Y. If [OX] < rOY] we also say that rOY] is greater than  [OX]. The relation < obviously defines a linear ordering of the set of  dIm's.  Let I denote the set of dIm's 'gauged' by the choice of a segment  OE. I will be endowed with a field structure. Let [OX], rOY] be two  dIm's. Let m be the line through a and X (Fig. 2). There is one and  only one member of rOY] whose first endpoint is X and whose last  endpoint lies on m. Let W be this last endpoint. We define [OW] to be  the sum ([OX] + rOY]) of [OX] and rOY]. The reader should satisfy  himself that '+' is an operation on I and that (1, +) is an Abelian  group. It should be clear, in particular, that [00] is the neutral  v [ow] =[ox] + [Ov]  [ov]=[xw]  o w </p><div id="pagenum"><p>Fig. 2. x </p></div><div id="pagenum"><p>BACKGROUND </p></div><p id="page">[oz) =[ox)· rOY)  [OE)=[OE')  rOY) = [OY')  E'X II v'z  Fig. 3. 37  z  element of the group and that [XO) is the inverse -[OX) of [OX). To  define the second field operation or product of two dIm's we shall use  the fact that our ordered lines are embedded in ordinary Euclidean  space. Descartes based his own construction on Euclid VI, 2: "If a  straight line be drawn parallel to one of the sides of a triangle, it will  cut the other sides [or those sides produced) proportionally." Let m  be a line ordered as above, with respect to points 0 and E. Let line  m' meet m at 0 (Fig. 3). Choose E' on m' so that OE'/OE =  OE/OE. We now define the product [OX) . rOY) of two dIm's [OX),  rOY), as follows: Let OY' be the member of rOY) whose first  endpoint is 0 and whose last endpoint lies on m'; let Z be the point  where m meets the parallel to E'X through point Y'; then [OZ) =  [OX) . rOY). It can be easily verified that '.' is indeed an operation  on I; that for every dim [OX), [OX), rOE) = rOE)' [OX) = [OX); and  that every non-null dIm [OX) has a reciprocal dim [OXr' such that  [OX) . [OXr' = [OXr' . [OX) = rOE). The reciprocal of [OX) can be  constructed thus: Let Z' be the point where m' meets the parallel to  E'X through E; then [OZ') = [OXr'. The reader should verify that  the operation '.' is commutative and associative, so that (I, +,.) is  indeed a field, with zero element [00) and unity rOE). (I, +,.) is  ordered by the relation <. It can be shown moreover that, if line  m has the property (D), (I, +, .) is complete. Since all complete  ordered fields are structurally equivalent, they are indistinguishable  from a mathematical point of view. Any such field is usually called  the real number field and is designated by the symbol R. Its elements,  qua elements of R, are called real numbers.97  The set of all ordered triples of elements of R is denoted by R3. We  shall show how to label each point of Euclidean space with an </p><div id="pagenum"><p>element of R 3. In other words, we shall define a bijective mapping of </p></div><div id="pagenum"><p>38 CHAPTER 1 </p></div><p id="page">the set of Euclidean points onto R3. To do this, we first define the  directed distance from a plane to a point. Let 7T be a plane. 7T has two  sides, which we conventionally label the positive and the negative  side, respectively. Let P be a point not on 7T, and Q its perpendicular  projection on 7T (i.e. the point where a line through P meets 7T at right  angles). There is one and only one positive dIm [OX], such that  PQ/OX = OX/PQ. The directed distance from 7T to P is [OX] if Plies  on the positive side of 7T; -[OX] if P lies on the negative side of 7T. If  P lies on 7T, its directed distance from 7T is [00]. Now, let 7Th 7T2, 7T3  be three mutually perpendicular planes. Let l(p) be the directed  distance from 7Tj to point P (i = 1,2,3). We assign to P the ordered  triple (t(P), [2(p}, p(P». It will be easily seen that this rule defines a  bijection of the set of all Euclidean points onto R3. For the points at  directed distance l(p) from 7Tj lie all on a plane on a definite side of  7Tj and at a definite distance from that plane; our ordered triple  determines therefore three mutually perpendicular planes which meet  only at P. On the other hand, for every ordered triple of dIm's ([OXIl,  lOX 2] , [OX 3]) there is a point X whose directed distance from 7Tj is  [OX;].  We shall hereafter use the following terminology: A bijective  mapping p,...... (fl(p), p(P), F(p)} of Euclidean space onto R3, con­ structed according to the above directions, will be called a Cartesian  mapping. Please observe that the definition of a Cartesian mapping  involves the arbitrary choice of an ordered triple of planes, of the  positive side of each of these planes and of a segment OE as a gauge  for distances. The ordered triple of planes that enter into the  definition of a Cartesian mapping is the frame, their point of inter­ section, the origin of the mapping. The frame (7Th 7T2, 7T3) of a  Cartesian mapping is said to be right-handed if the following condi­ tion is fulfilled: If I place my right hand at the origin, with the thumb  pointing toward the positive side of 7Tt. and the index finger pointing  toward the positive side of 7T2, I can bend the middle finger so that it  points toward the positive side of 7T3. The frame is left-handed if the  foregoing condition is fulfilled with the word 'left' substituted for  'right'. All frames of Cartesian mappings are either left-handed or  right-handed. In this book, unless otherwise stated, we assume that  they are right-handed. The three real numbers assigned to a point P  by a Cartesian mapping are called the coordinates of P by this </p><div id="pagenum"><p>mapping. If [ and g are two Cartesian mappings, the composite </p></div><div id="pagenum"><p>BACKGROUND 39 </p></div><p id="page">mapping g . rl is a (Cartesian) transformation of coordinates. If P is  any point of space, g . rl maps f(P) on g(P). Let x = (Xl, x2, x3) and  y = (y I, Y 2, l) be the coordinates of points P and Q, respectively, by  some Cartesian mapping. The positive square root of (Xl_- yl)2+  (X2_y2)2+(X 3_y3)2 (where we write '._yj, for '+(-yj)') is called  the distance between points P and Q or the length of segment PQ and  will be denoted by Ix -yl or by IPQI. It follows from the theorem of  Pythagoras that Ix -yl is a real number which does not depend on the  particular choice of a Cartesian mapping (it is, as we shall often say,  invariant under Cartesian transformations of coordinates). If Q  happens to be the origin of the mapping, yi = [00] (i = 1,2,3) and we  write Ixl instead of Ix -yl. Generally, if x = (Xl, ... , x·) is any n-tuple  of real numbers, we shall use the symbol Ixl to represent the positive </p><div id="pagenum"><p>square root of ~ 7=1 (Xi)2. </p></div><div id="pagenum"><p>CHAPTER 2 </p></div><p id="page">NON-EUCLIDEAN GEOMETRIES  It is unlikely that Euclid ever held his five postulates to be self­ evident. Mathematicians sharing the Aristotelian conviction that only  manifest truths may be admitted without proof in geometry usually  did not find the fifth postulate quite so obvious as the other four.  From Antiquity, many attempts were made to prove it, but the proofs  proposed depended always explicitly or implicitly upon new assump­ tions, no less questionable than the postulate itself. In the 1820's,  Janos Bolyai and Nikolai I. Lobachevsky independently of each other  developed two versions of a system of geometry based at once on the  denial of Postulate 5 and on the assertion of all the propositions of  Euclid's system which do not depend on it. We shall call this system  BL geometry. In a BL plane, for any straight line and any point  outside it there are infinitely many straight lines through the latter that  do not meet the former, while in a Euclidean plane, for any straight  line and any point outside it there is exactly one straight line through  the latter which does not meet the former. Coplanar straight lines  which do not meet each other Euclid calls parallel lines. Although  Postulate 5 does not mention parallels, it is applied by Euclid for the  first time in the proof of an important theorem concerning them. The  theory of parallels therefore provided the immediate context for the  debate over Postulate 5 and the eventual development of a geometry  based on its denial. We shall deal with this matter in Part 2.1.  In 1827, Carl Friedrich Gauss published his General Disquisitions  on Curved Surfaces, doubtless the main source of inspiration for the  remarkable generalization of the fundamental concepts of geometry  proposed by Bernhard Riemann in 1854. From Riemann's point of  view, Euclidean geometry is merely a special case among the  infinitely many metrical structures that a three-dimensional  continuum may possess. BL geometry, on the other hand, cor­ responds to a whole (infinite) family of cases. Still other, infinitely  many, cases are covered by neither of these two systems. In Part  2.2, we shall refer to Gauss's work and comment on Riemann's  insights. </p><div id="pagenum"><p>40 </p></div><div id="pagenum"><p>NON-EUCLIDEAN GEOMETRIES 41 </p></div><p id="page">Part 2.3 is concerned with another way of incorporating the  multiplicity of geometries into a unitary system, that was proposed by  Felix Klein in 1871. Riemann's conception is indeed deeper and has  exerted a much stronger influence on the use of geometry in physics  and on the philosophers who have reflected upon it; but Klein's idea,  together with the 19th-century development of projective geometry  that led to it, contributed to shape the abstract axiomatic approach  that has prevailed in foundational studies since the 1890's.  2.1 PARALLELS  2.1.1 Euclid's Fifth Postulate  Euclid's Postulate 5 ('Axiom XI' in some manuscripts and in the older  editions) has been translated thus:  If a straight line faIling on two straight lines make the interior angles on the same side  less than two right angles, the two straight lines, if produced indefinitely, meet on that  side on which are the angles less than the two right angles.'  In order to understand what this means we must assume that a  straight line divides each plane on which it lies into two half-planes. A  half -plane is determined unambiguously by a point on it and the  limiting straight line. Thus, if P is a point on a half-plane limited by  line s, we may denote the half-plane by (s, P). Euclid speaks about  two arbitrary straight lines m, n -which we must assume to be  coplanar -and a third straight line, the transversal t, that intersects  them, say at M and N, respectively. Interior angles are the two angles  made by t and m at M in the half-plane (m, N) and the two angles  made by t and n at N in the half-plane (n, M). One interior angle at M  al'~ one at N are on one side of t, the other two are on the other.  Si :.! the four interior angles add up to four right angles or 21T, and  tt;:; (Wo at each point add up to two right angles or 1T, the sum of the  two angles on one side of t is less than 1T if and only if the sum of the  other two is greater than 1T. Euclid postulates that if one of these  sums is less than 1T, the straight lines m and n meet at some point of  the half-plane limited by t which comprises the two angles that make  up the said sum. In other words, if two coplanar straight lines m and  n together with a transversal t make on the same side of t interior </p><div id="pagenum"><p>angles whose sum is less than 1T, the three lines m, nand t form a </p></div><div id="pagenum"><p>42 CHAPTER 2 </p></div><p id="page">triangle, with one of its vertices on the half-plane defined by t which  comprises those interior angles. In thus proclaiming the existence,  under certain conditions, of a triangle and consequently the ideal  possibility of constructing it, Postulate 5 follows the pattern of the  first three, all of which are statements of constructibility. It follows  this pattern only up to a point, however, for the constructions  postulated in the former postulates are not subject to any restrictions.  Postulate 5 says nothing about an alternative possibility, namely, that  the interior angles made by m and n on either side of t be equal to 7T.  In this case, the figure formed by t and the parts of m and n on one  side of t is congruent with the figure formed by t and the parts of m  and n on the other side of t. Therefore, if we assume that two straight  lines cannot meet at more than one point, it is obvious that in this  case m and n are parallel.  Euclid proves in Proposition 1.28 that two (coplanar) straight lines  are parallel if a transversal falling on them makes the interior angles  on the same side equal to 7T. Neither this proposition nor any other of  the twenty-seven preceding ones, depends on Postulate 5. The latter  is used for the first time in the proof of 1.29, which includes, among  other things, the converse of the preceding statement: if two straight  lines are parallel, any straight line falling on them makes interior  angles on the same side equal to 7T. In other words, given a straight  line m and a point P outside it, we can prove without using Postulate  5 that the flat pencil of straight lines through P on the same plane as  m include at least one line parallel to m, namely, the normal to the  perpendicular from P to m. By means of Postulate 5, we can prove  that this is the only line through P which is parallel to m. The  uniqueness of the parallel to a given straight line through a point  outside it plays an essential role in Euclid's proof of one of the key  theorems of his system, namely, Proposition 1.32: "The three interior  angles of a triangle are equal to two right angles."  2.1.2 Greek Commentators  Postulate 5 was probablY introduced by Euclid himself or by one of  his predecessors in order to solve those difficulties in the older theory  of parallels to which Aristotle referred in several passages.2 Its  meticulously precise formulation, as compared with the bluntness of </p><div id="pagenum"><p>the first four postulates, is easily understandable if it is true that the </p></div><div id="pagenum"><p>NON-EUCLIDEAN GEOMETRIES 43 </p></div><p id="page">postulate was consciously designed to provide a missing link in a  deductive chain: Euclid put into it exactly what he needed to prop up  his proofs. The contrast in style between the long-windedness and the  technicalities of Postulate 5 and the conciseness and apparent  simplicity of the other four must have perplexed Euclid's readers,  especially if they were wont to regard his aitemata or 'demands' as  the self-evident principles of an Aristotelian science. Our sources  indicate that some of the oldest commentators of the Elements  questioned the wisdom of including Postulate 5 among the statements  assumed without proof, and attempted to demonstrate it. Proclus had  no doubts on this matter. Postulate 5, he says, "ought to be struck  from the postulates altogether. For it is a theorem -one that invites  many questions, which Ptolemy proposed to resolve in one of his  books -and requires for its demonstration a number of definitions as  well as theorems".3 Proclus adds that Euclid himself has proved the  converse as a theorem (1.17). Of course, this is not a very cogent  argument. More significant is Proclus' objection to some authors who  maintained that Postulate 5 was self-evident. They had apparently  shown that it was really equivalent to a very simple statement, which  we might render, in mock-Greek no less laconic than the language of  the earlier postulates, eutheiai suneousai sumpiptousin, 'convergent  straight lines meet'. Proclus allows that two coplanar straight lines  that make internal angles less than 7T on one side of a transversal, do  indeed converge on that side, i.e. do indefinitely approach each other.  But he observes that it is not at all evident that convergent straight  lines should eventually meet, for it is a well-established fact that there  are lines -e.g. hyperbolae and their asymptotes -which approach  each other indefinitely but never meet. "May not this, then, be  possible for straight lines, as for those other lines? Until we have  firmly demonstrated that they meet, the facts shown about other lines  strip our imagination of its plausibility. And although the arguments  against the intersection of these lines may contain much that surprises  us, should we not all the more refuse to admit into our tradition this  unreasoned appeal to probability?,,4 Further on, in his commentary on  the basic propositions of parallel theory, Proclus reproduces  Ptolemy's proof of Postulate 5 and shows it is inadequate. He tries to  complete it but is no more successfu1.5 Nevertheless, these efforts  should not be dismissed as worthless, for they have helped to bring </p><div id="pagenum"><p>out the implications and equivalents of Postulate 5. </p></div><div id="pagenum"><p>44 CHAPTER 2 </p></div><p id="page">2.1.3 Wallis and Saccheri  We shall not review the history of the alleged demonstrations of  Postulate 5 through the medieval and renaissance periods until 1800.  We shall only refer briefly to the contribution of John Wallis (1616- 1703) and, more extensively, to the work of Girolamo Sac cheri  (1667-1733).  John Wallis published, in the second volume of his Mathematical  Works (1693), two lectures on our subject, which he had delivered in  1651 and 1663 from his Savilian Chair of Mathematics at Oxford  University. The first lecture is just an exposition of the proof of  Postulate 5 given by the Arabian mathematician Nasir-Eddin (1201- 1274), but the second one contains an original demonstration. At both  the beginning and the end of his lecture, Wallis declares that any such  proof is unnecessary and that we cannot take Euclid to task for  having tacitly assumed or openly postulated self-evident truths such  as that "two convergent [coplanar] lines finally meet".6 Nevertheless,  since so many have believed that Postulate 5 needs proof, Wallis sets  forth his own, hoping that it will be more persuasive than those  preceding it. It is based on eight lemmata. The first seven are  propositions proved by the usual methods, and under the familiar  assumptions, of geometry; but the eighth is a basic principle which  Wallis attempts not to prove but only to clarify so that it will appear  self-evident. He states it thus: "For every figure there exists a similar  figure of arbitrary magnitude".7 Wallis observes that, since magni­ tudes may be subjected to unlimited mUltiplication and division,  Lemma VIII follows from the very essence of quantitative relations,  inasmuch as every figure, while preserving its shape, may be in­ creased or reduced without limit. He adds that Euclid in fact assumes  this principle in his Postulate 3 ("to describe a circle with any centre  at any distance"), for "you may continuously increase or reduce a  circle in any way you wish without altering its shape, not because of  its superiority to the other figures, but because of the properties of  continuous magnitudes which the other figures share with the circle".8  In several passages, Wallis's text shows that the author was well  aware of the use of tacit assumptions in Euclid's proofs. It shows also  that Wallis was convinced that Postulate 5 cannot be demonstrated  unless we introduce another postulate in its place. He apparently  expected that his own postulate, i.e. Lemma VIII, would shine forth </p><div id="pagenum"><p>with greater evidence. He probably felt that it would be absurd to </p></div><div id="pagenum"><p>NON-EUCLIDEAN GEOMETRIES 45 </p></div><p id="page">deny it, since that would imply that there are no similar figures of  arbitrarily different sizes -in particular, no cubes or squares, for these  figures can obviously be mUltiplied through mere juxtaposition.  In 1733, Girolamo Saccheri, a jesuit well versed in the literature on  the problem of parallels, published a treatise whose Book I deals with  the subject.9 He proposes to prove Postulate 5 by a method not yet  tried, that of indirect proof. Saccheri attempts to show that the denial  of Postulate 5 is incompatible with the remaining familiar assump­ tions of geometry. Since he was probably aware that the proofs in  Book I of the Elements often depend on unstated premises, he  chooses to treat the first 26 propositions of that book, which, as we  know, do not depend on Postulate 5, as undemonstrated principles in  his argument. In fact, he also employs as implicit assumptions the  Archimedean postulate -if a and b are two straight segments, there  exists an integer n such that na > b -and a principle of continuity  that may be stated as follows: If a continuously varying magnitude is  first less and then greater than a given magnitude, then at some time it  must be equal to it. Sac cheri considers a certain plane figure, now  known as a Saccheri quadrilateral. To construct one, take a straight  segment AB and draw two equal perpendiculars AD and BC; the  four-sided polygon ABCD is a Saccheri quadrilateral. It is easily  proved that the angles at C and at D are equal. Saccheri proposes  three alternative hypotheses: that both angles are right angles, or that  DOC I  A B  ~OC II  A 8  ~OC ill  A B </p><div id="pagenum"><p>Fig. 4. </p></div><div id="pagenum"><p>46 </p></div><p id="page">x p CHAPTER 2  L  Fig. 5. H  both are obtuse, or that both are acute. We shall, for brevity, speak of  Hypotheses I, II and III. (Fig. 4.) Sac cheri shows that if one of them is  true in a single case, it is true in every case. Postulate 5 obtains under  Hypotheses I and II (Proposition XIII), but Hypothesis II happens to  be incompatible with some of the propositions initially admitted by  Saccheri. Postulate 5 will be proved if we manage to show that  Hypothesis III is also incompatible with that set of propositions. This  is a long and laborious enterprise that takes up most of Saccheri's  book.  The incompatibility of Hypothesis II with the set of initial assump­ tions is established in Proposition XIV. Its proof depends on Pro­ position IX, which states that, in a right triangle, the sum of the two  angles adjacent to the hypotenuse is equal to, greater than or less than  the remaining angle if Hypothesis I, II or III is true. Let APX be a  right triangle (Fig. 5). If Hypothesis II is true, the angles at X and A  are together greater than a right angle. We can find therefore an acute  angle PAD such that all three angles together are equal to two right  angles. Under Hypothesis II, Postulate 5 obtains; consequently PL  and AD meet at a point H. Triangle XAH has two interior angles  adjacent to side AX which are together equal to two right angles. This  contradicts Euclid 1.17. Hypothesis II is therefore incompatible with  the set of initial assumptions.  In the course of his fight against Hypothesis III, Sac cheri draws  from it several conclusions which today are well-known propositions  of BL geometry. The existence of one triangle whose three internal  angles are equal to, more than or less than 7r, is sufficient to validate  Hypothesis I, II or III, respectively (Proposition XV). If AB is a  straight segment, AK a straight line normal to AB, and BD a rayon  the same side of AB as K and making with AB an acute angle on the  side of AK, it may, under Hypothesis III, very well happen that BD </p><div id="pagenum"><p>does not meet AK. (Fig. 6.) Let BR be normal to AB (with R on the </p></div><div id="pagenum"><p>NON-EUCLIDEAN GEOMETRIES 47 </p></div><p id="page">B R  A K  Fig. 6.  same side of AB as K). All rays BD fitting the above description fall  within angle ABR. Saccheri proves that, under Hypothesis III, some  of these rays meet AK while others share with it a common perpen­ dicular. If we order the former group of rays according to the  increasing size of the angle they make with AB, and the latter group  according to the increasing size of the angle they make with BR, we  shall find that none of these two sequences of rays possesses a last  element. For reasons of continuity, Saccheri concludes that between  the two sequences there exists one and only one ray which does not  meet AK and does not share with it a common perpendicular. The  straight line comprising this ray approaches AK indefinitely. There­ fore, under Hypothesis III, there exist asymptotical straight lines as  Proclus surmised.  Saccheri chooses to state these results with the help of the some­ what tricky notion of an infinitely distant point. Let T be such a point  on AK, i.e. a point beyond K and beyond every other point of AK  which is at a finite distance from A. The rays of one of our sequences  meet AK at points increasingly distant from A; consequently, argues  Saccheri, the limiting ray of that sequence meets AK at T. The rays  of the other sequence are met by perpendiculars which meet AK  orthogonally at points ever more distant from A; consequently, the  limiting ray of this sequence must have a perpendicular which meets  AK orthogonally at T. But the limiting ray of both sequences is the  same ray BT. Therefore BT and AK have a common perpendicular at  one and the same point. But this is absurd, for two different straight  lines cannot both meet another line perpendicularly at one point -if it  is true that all right angles are equal (Euclid, Postulate 4) and that two  different straight lines cannot have a common segment. Saccheri does  not ask himself whether everything that is true of ordinary points is </p><div id="pagenum"><p>necessarily true of an infinitely distant point. It would have been </p></div><div id="pagenum"><p>48 CHAPTER 2 </p></div><p id="page">safer, of course, to leave such a point entirely out of this discussion,  as it was done above. But then Saccheri's first refutation of Hypo­ thesis III would not have come about. However, he gives a second  one, based this time on the notion of an infinitely short segment. We  shall not go into it.  In Note II to Proposition XXI, Saccheri proposes three "physico­ geometrical" experiments that might confirm Postulate 5. It is no  longer necessary to travel indefinitely along two straight lines making,  on the same side of a third, interior angles less than 7T, in order to  know whether they meet or not. In the light of the theorems proved  by Saccheri this question can be decided on the basis of the proper­ ties of a finite spatial configuration. The existence of one Saccheri  quadrilateral with four right angles suffices to verify Postulate 5. Its  truth is guaranteed also by the existence of a right triangle whose  hypotenuse coincides with the diameter of a circle while its opposite  vertex lies on the circumference of this circle; or of a polygonal line  which is inscribed in a circle and consists of three segments, each  equal to the radius of the circle, joining the extremities of one of its  diameters. While Saccheri claims correctly that anyone of these three  figures is very easy to construct, he makes no reference at all to the  fact that exact measurements are physically impossible. Yet he must  have known that a piece of flat land can be divided into lots whose  shape everybody would call rectangular but that nevertheless the  earth is round and Postulate 5 is not applicable to the straightest lines  that join points on its surface.  2.1.4 Johann Heinrich Lambert  Saccheri's work was not unknown to his contemporaries. Stacke! and  Engel have verified its presence, since the 18th century, in several  public libraries in Germany. It is mentioned in the histories of  mathematics of Heilbronner (1742) and Montucla (1758). G.S. Klugel  (1739-1812) studies it carefully in his doctoral dissertation on the  main attempts to prove Postulate 5. Kluge! concludes that Saccheri's  alleged proof is not more cogent than the other thirty or so he  examines. He observes that "it is possible that non-intersecting  straight lines are divergent", and adds: "That this is absurd we know  not by strict inferences nor by any distinct notions of the straight line  and the curved line, but by experience and the judgment of our </p><div id="pagenum"><p>eyes".10 Indeed, our eyes would be hard put to pass judgment on the </p></div><div id="pagenum"><p>NON-EUCLIDEAN GEOMETRIES 49 </p></div><p id="page">absurdity of that statement if two straight lines diverge and hence  converge very, very slowly, for then the intersection, if it occurs, will  be hopelessly beyond their reach. But perhaps K1ugel could not carry  his sceptical remarks any further while contending for a university  degree.  K1iigel's dissertation is praised by the Swiss philosopher and  mathematician Johann Heinrich Lambert (1728-1777) in his Theory of  Parallels, published posthumously in 1786 but apparently written in  1766. Reading K1ugel, Lambert learned about Saccheri, if he had not  already had direct access to the latter's book. His own work, we shall  see, may be regarded as a continuation of Saccheri's. The first section  of Lambert's essay deals with methodology. It culminates in the  following passage:  The difficulties concerning Euclid's 11th axiom [i.e. Postulate 5] have essentially to do  only with the following question: Can this axiom be derived correctly from Euclid's  postulates and the remaining axioms? Or, if these premises are not sufficient, can we  produce other postulates or axioms, no less evident than Euclid's, from which his 11th  axiom can be derived? In dealing with the first part of this question we may wholly  ignore what I have called the representation of the subject-matter [Vorstellung der  Sachel. Since Euclid's postulates and remaining axioms are stated in words, we can  and should demand that no appeal be made anywhere in the proof to the matter itself,  but that the proof be carried out -if it is at all possible -in a thoroughly symbolic  fashion. In this respect, Euclid's postulates are, so to speak, like so many given  algebraic equations, from which we must obtain x, y, z, etc., without ever looking back  to the matter in discussion [die Sache selbst]. Since the postulates are not quite  such formulae, we can allow the drawing of a figure as a guiding thread [Leitfaden I to  direct the proof. On the other hand, it would be preposterous to forbid consideration  and representation of the subject-matter in the second part of the question, and to  require that the new postulates and axioms be found without reflecting on their  subject-matter, off the cuff, so to speak."  Lambert's mathematical methodology combines a would-be total  formalism in the derivation of theorems with a healthy appeal to  intuition in the search for, and the statement of, postulates and  axioms. Lambert apparently does not countenance the possibility that  "the representation of the subject-matter" might prove insufficient or  ambiguous with regard to the truth of Postulate 5.  The programme sketched in the passage quoted above will aid us in  understanding some novelties in Lambert's treatment of the theory of  parallels. His starting-point is a quadrilateral with three right angles. </p><div id="pagenum"><p>He examines three hypotheses, called by him the first, the second and </p></div><div id="pagenum"><p>50 CHAPTER 2 </p></div><p id="page">the third, which are, that the fourth angle is a right angle, that it is  obtuse, or that it is acute.12 In three separate sections, Lambert  derives consequences from each of these hypotheses. In the proofs  based on the second one, he studiously avoids using any of the  propositions in Euclid which are incompatible with it (1.16 and its  consequences): only towards the end of the section does he appeal to  one of those propositions, and this just in order to carry out the  refutation of the 2nd hypothesis. I think that this procedure ought to  be understood in the light of Lambert's formalism which naturally  leads him to explore the possibility of a consistent deductive system  based on the 2nd hypothesis, no less than that of one based on the  3rd. On the other hand, Lambert the intuitionist knows of a  "representation of the subject-matter" which satisfies the 2nd hypo­ thesis, if only we agree to give an appropriate interpretation to the  intrinsically meaningless terms of the corresponding formal system.  "It seems remarkable to me" -he writes -"that the 2nd hypothesis  should hold when we consider spherical triangles instead of plane  triangles",!3 in other words. when we understand by 'straight lines'  the great circles on a sphere. These. as is well known. always contain  the shortest path between any two points lying on them. But they are  closed lines. and they intersect each other at more than one point; so  they do not share those properties of ordinary straight lines used in  the refutation of the 2nd hypothesis. Even more surprising are the  next two remarks of Lambert: (i) The geometry of spherical triangles  does not depend upon the solution of the problem of parallels. for it is  equally true under any of the three hypotheses; (ii) the 3rd hypo­ thesis. in which the fourth angle of Lambert's quadrilateral is  assumed to be less than a right angle, might hold true on an imaginary  sphere. i.e. on a sphere whose radius is a pure imaginary number.14  We have seen that Lambert had a formalist conception of mathema­ tks which likened the premises of a deductive system to a set of  algebraic equations whose terms may denote any object satisfying the  relations expressed therein. He also discovered the modern idea of a  model, that is. of an object or domain of objects which happens to  fulfil precisely the conditions abstractly stated in the hypotheses of  the system. Such content is supplied by the "representation of the  subject-matter". which, according to Lambert, ought to guide the  selection of hypotheses. Lambert's last remark shows how broadly he </p><div id="pagenum"><p>conceived of this kind of "representation". for an imaginary sphere is </p></div><div id="pagenum"><p>NON-EUCLIDEAN GEOMETRIES 51 </p></div><p id="page">not something we could visualize or mould in clay or in papier machi,  but a purely intelligible entity.  Under the 3rd hypothesis the fourth angle of a Lambert quadrila­ teral is always acute; the bigger the quadrilateral, the more acute the  angle. This makes it possible to transfer the absolute system of  measurement, which is familiar in the case of angles, to the  measurement of distances, areas and volumes. Indeed, it is enough to  take as the absolute unit of length the base of a Lambert quadrilateral  whose fourth angle has a given size and whose two sides not adjacent  to that angle stand in a fixed proportion to each other. Lambert  observes that "there is something alluring about this consequence  which readily arouses the desire that the 3rd hypothesis be  true!,,15 Such advantage, however. would have to be paid for by many  inconveniences, the worst of which would be the elimination of the  similarity and proportionality of non-congruent figures, which  Lambert believes would be ruinous to astronomy. Saccheri showed  that under the 3rd hypothesis the sum of the three interior angles a, {3,  'Y of an arbitrary triangle are less than 7T. Lambert shows that the  'defect'. 7T -a -{3 -'Y, is proportional to the area of the triangle.  Stackel and Engel suggest that this result prompted Lambert's remark  about the fulfilment of the 3rd hypothesis on an imaginary sphere.  Indeed, the above expression for the 'defect' is obtained from the  familiar formula for the area of a spherical triangle with angles a, {3, 'Y  upon a sphere of radius r, i.e. r2(a + (3 + 'Y -7T), by substituting \1(-1)  for r. Lambert's refutation of the 3rd hypothesis is based only on the  following: if it were true, two mutually perpendicular straight lines  would be parallel to the same line. Lambert finds this an intolerable  paradox. The 2nd hypothesis is easier to refute, for it implies that  some pairs of straight lines intersect at more than one point. This  consequence can be avoided if we allow for straight lines that close  upon themselves, but this is, of course, just as paradoxical. Max Dehn  has shown that Saccheri's and Lambert's second hypotheses -which  are indeed equivalent -do not imply any of these paradoxical  consequences once we strike out from our assumptions the postulate  of Archimedes. 16  Many treatises and memoirs on the theory of parallels were pub­ lished in the late 18th and early 19th centuries. The most influential  were probably those by Adrien Marie Legendre (1752-1833), which </p><div id="pagenum"><p>excelled more in the, often deceptive, elegance and clarity of the </p></div><div id="pagenum"><p>52 CHAPTER 2 </p></div><p id="page">proofs, than in the novelty of the results.17 The contribution of F.A.  Taurinus (1794-1874), in his Theory of Parallels (1825) and in an  appendix to his Elements of Geometry (1826), is more interesting. The  author, who was induced to study the subject by his uncle, F.K.  Schweikart (1780-1857), a professor of jurisprudence, gives  unqualified assent to Euclidean geometry, but admits the possibility  of developing in a purely formal way a consistent system of geometry  where the three interior angles of a triangle are less than 7r. (This  condition is equivalent to Saccheri's Hypothesis III.) Taurinus carries  the analytical development of this system -which, in his opinion,  "might not lack significance in mathematics,,18 -much further than  Saccheri or Lambert, anticipating some important results published  later by Lobachevsky.  In a memorandum to Gauss of December, 1818, F.K. Schweikart  had set forth the main theses of a new geometry which he called  Astralgeometrie, probably to suggest that it might be true on an  astronomical scale. 19 In this geometry, the three angles of a triangle  are less than 77', the more so the larger the triangle. Also there exists a  characteristic constant, which Schweikart defined as the upper bound  of the height drawn from the hypotenuse of an isosceles right triangle.  (This is, of course, equal to the distance from the vertex of a right  angle to the straight line parallel to both its sides; the existence of  such a parallel was the paradox which had led Lambert to reject his  3rd hypothesis.) Gauss remarked that he wholly approved of  Schweikart's ideas, which seemed to him to come "from his own  heart".2o Schweikart never published them, however, but persuaded  his nephew Taurinus, a professional mathematician, to develop them.  The remarkable results obtained by the latter are based simply on the  substitution, in the formulae of spherical trigonometry, of imaginary  numbers for the radius and the sides. Taurinus' success confirms  Lambert's bold conjecture. Taurinus maintains that this new system  is wholly unacceptable, for "it contradicts all intuition". "It is true",  he adds, "that such a system would exhibit locally [im Kleinen] the  same appearances as the Euclidean system; but if the representation  of space may be regarded as the mere form of outer sense, the  Euclidean system is indisputably the true one and we cannot assume  that a limited experience could generate an illusion of the senses. ,,21  He gives seven additional reasons for the truth of Euclidean </p><div id="pagenum"><p>geometry, all of them about as persuasive as the first. A more novel </p></div><div id="pagenum"><p>NON-EUCLIDEAN GEOMETRIES 53 </p></div><p id="page">and interesting argument is based on the existence of the charac­ teristic constant. There are as many different forms of the new  system as admissible values of the constant. There is no reason  whatsoever for preferring one of these values over the others; thus, if  the new geometry were true, all its different forms would be true at  the same time. Hence, Taurinus concludes, two arbitrary points  would determine infinitely many straight lines, one for each value of  the constant. Euclid's system, on the other hand, is univocal.  2.1.5 The Discovery of Non-Euclidean Geometry  The first publications in which a system of non-Euclidean geometry is  presented without reservation are a paper "On the Principles of  Geometry" (1829-30) by Nikolai I. Lobachevsky (1793-1856) and the  "Appendix presenting the Absolutely True Science of Space" by  Janos Bolyai (1802-1860).22 The former contains the essentials of a  lecture delivered at the University of Kazan on February 12, 1826.  The latter was printed at the end of Volume I of the Elements of pure  mathematics (1832) by the author's father, Farkas Bolyai (1775-1856),  and is a Latin translation of a paper the author had sent to his former  teacher, J. W. von Eckwehr, in 1825. The system presented in each of  these works is essentially the same - a consistent and uninhibited  development from assumptions equivalent to Saccheri's Hypothesis  III (and Schweikart's Astralgeometrie) -but the authors discovered it  independently and put it forth in different terminology. It is the  system we have agreed to call BL geometry. Before the discoveries  of the Russian professor and the Hungarian captain, Carl Friedrich  Gauss (1777-1855), the most illustrious mathematician of the time,  had become convinced that there were no purely mathematical  reasons for preferring Euclidean geometry to this non-Euclidean  system and had worked successfully in the development of the latter.  The posthumous edition of his papers and letters leaves no doubt  about that. But Gauss never wished to publish his ideas on this  matter, for fear, he confided to Bessel, of "the uproar of Boeotians" .23  By 1831, he had begun to put them in writing, so "that they not perish  with me", as he told Schumacher. 24 But early in 1832 he received the  work of Janos Bolyai, sent by his father Farkas, who had been a good  friend of Gauss when they were young. Gauss thereupon realized that  he could spare himself the trouble of writing out his discoveries, for </p><div id="pagenum"><p>his friend's son had anticipated him.2s </p></div><div id="pagenum"><p>54 CHAPTER 2 </p></div><p id="page">*Sorne writers, perhaps astonished that such a radically innovative  conception could arise independently, and be accepted without  qualms for the first time, outside the heartlands of European civiliza­ tion, have attempted to trace the influence of Gauss upon Janos  Bolyai, exerted allegedly through his father Farkas, and upon  Lobachevsky, through J.M.C. Bartels, a German professor of  mathematics in Kazan and an acquantance of Gauss. But Gauss' titles  to glory are so many and so great that I do not see any point in trying  to place upon him the full burden of this particular discovery. Gauss  himself expressly acknowledged the originality of Bolyai and  Lobachevsky. On February 14, 1832, he wrote to Gerling: "A few  days ago I received from Hungary a short work about non-Euclidean  geometry, where I find all my own ideas and RESULTS developed with  great elegance but in such a concentrated form that it will be hard to  follow for someone to whom this matter is foreign. The author is a  very young Austrian officer, the son of an old friend of mine, with  whom I often spoke about the subject in 1798, at a time, however,  when my ideas were still very far from the elaborateness and maturity  they have attained through this young man's own thinking. I regard  this young geometer Bolyai as a genius of the first magnitude".26  Fourteen years later Gauss wrote to Schumacher: "I have recently  had the occasion of once again going through Lobachevsky's booklet  (Geometrische Untersuchungen zur Theorie der Parallellinien, Berlin  1840, bei G. Fincke. 4 sheets). It contains the elements of the  geometry that must obtain and with strict consistency can obtain if  Euclidean geometry is not the true one. A man called Schweikart  named such a geometry astral geometry; Lobachevsky calls it im­ aginary geometry. You know that I have had this conviction for 54  years already (since 1792); [ ... ] I have therefore found nothing in  Lobachevsky's work that is substantially new to me, but the  development follows a different road than the one I myself took,  being masterfully carried out by Lobachevsky in a genuine geometric  spirit. I believe I ought to draw your attention to this book which will  give you thoroughly exquisite pleasure".27 There is no extant docu­ ment to prove that Gauss believed in the consistency of BL geometry  as far back as 1792. There is a letter to Farkas Bolyai, dated  December 16, 1799, in which Gauss declares that he has come to  doubt the truth of geometry and that, although he knows of several </p><div id="pagenum"><p>apparently obvious premises from which Postulate 5 readily foHows, </p></div><div id="pagenum"><p>NON-EUCLIDEAN GEOMETRIES 55 </p></div><p id="page">he is not willing to take any of them for granted.28 Emphatic state­ ments on the matter are made by him only much later, e.g. in his letter  to Gerling of April 11, 1816, where he writes that he finds "nothing  absurd" in the consequences of denying Postulate 5, such as that no  incongruent figures can be similar to each other or that the size of the  angles of an equilateral triangle must vary with the size of the sides.  He adds that the existence of an absolute unit of length may seem  somewhat paradoxical, but that he fails to find anything contradictory  about it and that it even seems desirable.29 On April 28, 1817, he  writes to Olbers: "I am ever more convinced that the necessity of our  geometry cannot be proved, at least not by, and not for, our HUMAN  understanding. Maybe in another life we shall attain insights into the  essence of space which are now beyond our reach. Until then we  should class geometry not with arithmetic, which stands purely a  priori, but, say, with mechanics".30 On March 16, 1819, after receiving  Schweikart's memorandum, he wrote to Gerling: "I have myself  developed astral geometry to the point where I can solve all its  problems completely if the [characteristic] constant C is given".31 A  very clear and eloquent statement of Gauss' views is given in a letter  of November 8, 1824, to Taurinus, where he bids him to keep them to  himself.32  2.1.6 Some Results of Bolyai-Lobachevsky Geometry  The founders of BL geometry took all the explicit and implicit  a~sumptions of Euclid for granted, except Postulate 5. In Section  2.1.7, we shall have something to say about the epistemological  significance of this attitude, but for the time being we, too, shall  assume it when sketching a proof of some of their results. Other  results, we shall quote without proof.  Let P be a point and m a straight line not through P (Fig. 7). Line m  has two senses or directions which we agree to call the plus direction  and the minus direction. Consider the flat pencil of straight lines  through P on the same plane as m. Let us call it (P, m). One and only  one line in (P, m) is perpendicular to m; call it t and let it meet m at  Q. t has two sides which we shall label as the plus side and the minus  side according to the following rule: if we change sides by moving  along m in the plus direction, then we go over from the minus side of  t to the plus side. The remaining lines of (P, m) belong to two sets: </p><div id="pagenum"><p>the set of all lines making an interior angle -i.e. an angle toward </p></div><div id="pagenum"><p>56 CHAPTER 2 </p></div><p id="page">s  n--------""'Iot------ m-----~~ ______ _  +  s makes the interior angle «on the  plus side of t.  Fig. 7.  m -on the plus side of t equal to or less than one right angle (the plus  set) and the set of all lines making such an angle on the minus side of  t (the minus set). There is one and only one line common to both sets,  namely the perpendicular to t; let us call it n. Henceforth, we shall  consider only the plus set; whatever we learn about it applies by  symmetry, mutatis mutandis, to the minus set. For every point of m  on the plus side of t there is a line of the plus set meeting m at that  point. There is at least one line of the plus set which does not meet m,  for n is such a line. This justifies the following definition: A line s of  pencil (P, m), making an interior angle (J' on the plus side of t, is the  parallel to m in the plus direction if and only if s does not meet m but  m meets every line in (P,m) which makes an interior angle smaller  than (J' on the plus side of t.  Definitions of parallelism essentially identical to this were adopted  independently by Gauss, Bolyai and Lobachevsky.33 The reason for  abandoning Euclid's definition is this: If Postulate 5 is true the new  and the old definitions are equivalent; if Postulate 5 is false, there are  two kinds of lines in (P, m) which do not meet m, namely the two  parallels, one in each direction, and an infinite set of lines between  them. These lines, called hyperparallels by some, have important  properties not shared by the two parallels; e.g. each of them has a  perpendicular which is also normal to m. Euclid's definition, however,  makes no distinction between these two kinds of lines, for according  to it all of them are 'parallels'.  It is clear that there is one and only one line through P which is  parallel to m in the plus direction. It can be shown that, if s is that </p><div id="pagenum"><p>line, and P' is any point on s, then s is the one line through P' that is </p></div><div id="pagenum"><p>NON-EUCLIDEAN GEOMETRIES 57 </p></div><p id="page">parallel to m in the plus direction. In other words, parallelism in the  plus direction is not relative to a particular point or pencil of lines.  Moreover parallelism in the plus direction is a symmetric and tran­ sitive relation. The parallel to m in the plus direction makes at point P  at a distance PQ from m an interior angle u on the plus side of the  perpendicular t. We call u the angle of parallelism of segment PQ, for  its size depends only on the length of this segment. In particular, it is  equal to the interior angle made at P on the minus side of t by the  parallel to m in the minus direction.  The last two statements are easily proved. Let P, Q, m, sand u be  as above; suppose s' is a straight line through a point P', parallel in  some direction K to a line m'; let the perpendicular to m' through P'  meet m' at Q', with P'Q' = PQ; s' makes on the K side of P'Q' an  interior angle u'. If u' > u, there is a straight line through P' making  on the K side of P'Q' an internal angle equal to u and meeting m' at  H'. There exists then a triangle PQH congruent to triangle  P'Q'H', such that PH lies on sand QH lies on m; but then s meets m  at H and is not parallel to m, contrary to our assumption. A similar  contradiction follows if u' < u. Therefore, if P'Q' = PQ, u' = u. The  last statement preceding this paragraph follows immediately if we make  P' = P and m' = m and let K be the minus direction.  According to our definitions, the angle of parallelism of PQ may be  equal to or less than 7r/2. If it is equal to 7r/2, the parallel to m in the  plus direction is identical to the parallel to m in the minus direction: it  is line n, the perpendicular to PQ through P. It can be proved that if  the angle of parallelism of any given segment equals 7r/2 then the  angle of parallelism of every segment has the same value. In that  case, through each point P outside a line m there is one and only one  parallel to m, the same in both directions. This is equivalent to  Postulate 5. Conversely, if the angle of parallelism of any segment is  less than 7r/2, it is less than 7r/2 for every segment. Consequently, all  parallel lines in a given direction converge asymptotically and no two  parallel lines have a common perpendicular. From this last statement  it follows that if any angle of parallelism is less than 7r/2, the angle of  parallelism of a segment of length x decreases as x increases.  Following Lobachevsky, we shall hereafter designate by n(x) the  angle of parallelism of a segment of length x. We regard n as a  real-valued function on lengths. Lobachevsky proved that unless </p><div id="pagenum"><p>Postulate 5 is true, n is a monotonically decreasing continuous </p></div><div id="pagenum"><p>58 CHAPTER 2 </p></div><p id="page">function that takes all values between 'Tr/2 and 0 as x goes from 0 to  00.34 Of course, if Postulate 5 is true, II(x) = constant = 'Tr12. In the  discussion to follow, we shall disregard this case.  We shall not prove Lobachevsky's full statement but shall show  that, if II(x) < 'Tr12, 0 < x < x' implies that II(x) > II(x'). Consider a  point Q on a line m and a line PQ perpendicular to m. Let IPQI = x.  Produce PQ beyond P to P' and let IP'QI = x'. Let sand s' be the  parallels to m in a given direction K that go, respectively, through P  and P'. Since sand s' are parallel to one another, they cannot have a  common perpendicular. Consequently, II(x) # II(x'). (Proof: Let H be  the midpoint of PP'; the perpendicular to s through H meets s at R, s'  at R'; if II(x) = II(x'), triangle PHR is congruent with triangle P'HR'  and RR' is also perpendicular to s'.) If II(x) < II(x') there is a line  through P' that makes an interior angle equal to II(x) on side K of PQ  and meets m at a point G. P'G and s have a common perpendicular  (Proof: By the above construction) and P'G meets s between P' and  G. But this is impossible. Consequently, II(x) > II(x'). Q.E.D.  II is an injective or 'one-one' mapping of the positive real numbers  onto the open interval (0, 'Tr/2). The inverse mapping II-I is therefore  defined on (0, 'Tr/2) and enables us to express length in terms of  angular measure. This is the surprising feature of BL geometry which  even Gauss and Lobachevsky judged paradoxica1.35 Angular measure  is absolute and involves a natural unit; while length, we are wont to  believe, is essentially relative, so that a sudden duplication of all  distances in the universe would make no difference whatsoever to the  geometrical aspect of things. This is not true of a BL world as the  following example will show. Let C be a positive real number such  that II(C) = 'Tr14. Take a point Q on a straight line m and let C be the  length of a segment PQ that meets m orthogonally at Q. Each of the  parallels to m through P makes an interior angle equal to 'Tr14 on the  corresponding side of PQ (Fig. 8). Consequently, the two parallels are  p ±  Q </p><div id="pagenum"><p>Fig. 8. </p></div><div id="pagenum"><p>NON-EUCLIDEAN GEOMETRIES 59 </p></div><p id="page">orthogonal and m is parallel to two mutually perpendicular straight  lines. C is therefore the distance -the same everywhere in BL space­ between the vertex of a right angle and the line parallel to its two  sides.36 Now, if we can ascribe a precise physical denotation to the  terms 'right angle' and 'straight line', and if, under this ascription of  meanings, BL geometry happens to be true of the physical world, C  will be a physical distance, say, so many times the average distance  from the sun to the earth. Under such conditions, the duplication of  all distances would make a difference in the geometrical aspect of  things, unless it were accompanied by an appropriate change in the  function II.  One of the main problems of BL geometry is the analytical deter­ mination of II. Its elegant solution by Lobachevsky was, no doubt, a  powerful inducement to accept BL geometry as a respectable branch  of mathematics. II involves an arbitrary constant. We can make this  constant equal to 1 by agreeing that C = rr-l( 71'/4) = InO + \1'2). Then  II(x) = 2 arc cot eX and x = In cot(~II(x». These results are used in the  derivation of the formulae of BL trigonometry. As anticipated by  Lambert and confirmed by Taurinus, the latter are identical to the  formulae of spherical trigonometry, with an imaginary number  substituted for radius r (pp.66f.). Another theorem of BL geometry  which deserves mention was also anticipated by Lambert. In BL  geometry the three angles of a triangle equal 71' -8, where 8, the  'defect' of the triangle, is a positive real number. It is easily shown  that if a triangle A is partitioned into triangles Bb ... , Bn, the defect  of A is equal to the sum of the defects of Bh ... , Bn. This implies that  the defect of a triangle increases with its area. It can be proved that  the area is strictly proportional to the defect. Since the defect cannot  exceed 71', the area of a BL triangle has an upper bound equal to k71',  where k is the coefficient of proportionality.  We may view C as the characteristic constant of BL geometry. It is  quite obvious that if we let C increase beyond all bounds, BL  geometry approaches Euclidean geometry as a limit. This connection  between the two geometries can be shown also from anoth'er, most  instructive perspective. Let m be a straight line, K one of the  directions of m, m' a line parallel to m in direction K. Given a point Q  on m, there is exactly one point Q' on m' such that the perpendicular  bisector of QQ' is parallel to m (and hence to m') in direction K. We </p><div id="pagenum"><p>shall say that Q and Q' are corresponding points. Correspondence is a </p></div><div id="pagenum"><p>60 CHAPTER 2 </p></div><p id="page">symmetric and transitive relation. Consider now the set At of all lines  in space that are parallel to m in direction K. We call At (including m)  a family of parallels in space. The locus of the points corresponding  to Q on each of these lines is a smooth surface Je which we call a  horosphere. We say that m is an axis of Je. The name horosphere is  meant to remind us of the following: if horosphere Je cuts axis m at  Q and if P is a point of m on the concave side of Je, a sphere with  centre P and radius PQ touches Je but does not intersect it; as PQ  increases beyond all bounds, the sphere indefinitely approaches Je­ in other words, a horosphere is the limit (horos) towards which a  sphere tends as its radius tends towards infinity. Let us now consider  any line m' belonging to set At, i.e. any line parallel to m in direction  K; if m' intersects Je at Q', Je is clearly the locus of the points  corresponding to Q' on every line of At. Each line of At is therefore an  axis of Je. Every axis of Je is normal to Je. All horospheres are  congruent. A plane { through an axis of a horosphere Je intersects Je  on a curve h which we call a horocycle; h is clearly a locus of  corresponding points on the parallels to the given axis that lie on  plane {. On the other hand, if no axis of Je lies on { and { meets Je,  their intersection is a circle. A horocycle is an open curve; a horocy­ de lying on a horosphere divides it into two parts; all horocycles are  congruent; moreover, two arcs of horocycle are congruent if they  subtend equal chords. Horocycles, as we see, share some of the  properties of straight lines. Consider two mutually intersecting horo­ cycles h, k on a horosphere Je, determined by two mutually intersec­ ting planes C, 1/. Let w be the intersection of C and 1/. We agree to  measure the curvilinear angle formed by hand k by the rectilinear  angle made by two straight lines lying on C and 1/, respectively, and  meeting w perpendicularly at the same point. Now let a, b, c be  horocycles on a horosphere Je such that c cuts a and b making  interior angles on the same side of c less than two right angles; then,  as both Bolyai and Lobachevsky proved, a and b meet. Bolyai  concluded without more ado: "From this it is evident that Euclid's  Axiom XI [i.e. Postulate 5] and all things which are claimed in  geometry and trigonometry hold good absolutely in [horosphere Je],  L-form lines [Le. horocycles] being substituted in place of  straights".37 Lobachevsky shows this in detail. He proves in particular  that the three interior angles of a horospherical triangle -i.e. a figure </p><div id="pagenum"><p>limited by three horocycles on a horosphere -are equal to 1T and that </p></div><div id="pagenum"><p>NON-EUCLIDEAN GEOMETRIES 61 </p></div><p id="page">figures traced on a horosphere may be similar without being  congruent.38 We saw above that a horosphere is, so to speak, a sphere  with infinite radius. It is well known that in Euclidean geometry a  sphere with infinite radius is a plane. But of course, if Postulate 5 is  true, a horosphere, i.e. a surface normal to a family of parallels in  space, is a plane. No wonder then that, under Postulate 5, horos­ pherical geometry should be identical with plane geometry. Now, if  Postulate 5 is true, the radii of the sphere which, in the finite case,  jointly converge to a point, tend to become, as they grow beyond all  bounds, a family of Euclidean parallels, i.e. a set of non-convergent  lines running equidistantly along each other. On the other hand, if  Postulate 5 is false, the radii become at infinity a family of BL  parallels, so that their convergence persists, though it is now asymp­ totic. This led Lobachevsky to remark that the transition to infinity is  carried out 'better' in BL geometry than in Euclidean geometry. He  appears to have thought that such smoothness of transition, occurring  even where continuity is broken, was typical of the general or normal  case, while the abruptness exemplified by Euclidean geometry was  distinctive of a singular, unnatural case, laden with arbitrary, artificial  assumptions (the degenerate case where horospheres collapse into  planes). Mathematicians have since learned not to place too much  trust in such intuitive considerations. But Lobachevsky's remark can  still teach something to philosophers who believe that 'intuition'  unconditionally favours Euclidean geometry.  2.1.7 The Philosophical Outlook of the Founders of Non-Euclidean  Geometry  Euclidean and BL geometry are often described by philosophical  writers as two abstract axiomatic theories which agree in all their  axioms except one, Postulate 5, which is asserted by Euclidean  geometry and denied by BL geometry. Both are equally consistent  and hence equally admissible from a logical point of view. The  question of their truth in a 'real', 'material' or transcendent sense,  cannot be decided within the theories, i.e. by an examination and  comparison of their contents. Although the advent of BL geometry  eventually contributed to the development and popularization of the  formalist philosophy of mathematics leading to the above description,  its creators never viewed it in that way. Although that philosophy had </p><div id="pagenum"><p>been anticipated, up to a certain point, by Lambert and other 18th-</p></div><div id="pagenum"><p>62 CHAPTER 2 </p></div><p id="page">century writers, it did not guide the efforts of Gauss or Lobachevsky  toward the formulation of a new system of geometry. Abstract  axiomatic theories consist of the logical consequences of arbitrarily  posited unproved premises -the axioms -containing diversely inter­ pretable undefined terms -the primitives. The axioms are all equally  groundless, and anyone of them may be negated -unless it happens  to be a consequence of the others -to obtain a different theory. The  primitives are semantically neutral, the spectrum of their admissible  meanings being restricted only by the net of mutual relations into  which they are knit by the axioms. But the founders of BL geometry  had little use for such equality and neutrality. They made a neat  distinction between Postulate 5, on which they suspended judgment,  and the remaining assumptions of geometry, whose truth they never  questioned, and which they regarded as the unshakeable basis of what  Bolyai called "the absolutely true science of space". We might even  say that, had they succeeded in their youthful attempts to derive  Postulate 5 from those other assumptions, they would have sat  content in the belief that the old Euclidean Elements, their flaw  removed, furnished that definite and final knowledge of the laws of  space upon which alone a fruitful and reliable physical science could  be built. After their attempts failed and they became persuaded that  such failure was inevitable, Lobachevsky and Bolyai directed part of  their efforts towards absorbing the old geometry within a more  general system, that was well defined only up to a constant. This  reveals a strong penchant to preserve the unity of geometry, which  may help explain why they did not pay any attention to the comfort­ able notion of semantic neutrality. The new ideas, indeed. would have  been readily accepted. had their proponents acknowledged that the  basic terms need not mean the same in the new geometry as in the  old; that BL straights. for example. might after all really not be  straight, at least not in the ordinary sense of the word. This admission  would certainly have assuaged the antipathy aroused by the seem­ ingly incomprehensible asymptotic convergence of BL parallels; if  they were not genuinely straight, and hence not really parallel.  nobody would have disputed the possibility that they converge  asymptotically. But that wilful cossack. Lobachevsky. would have  none of it. On the one occasion when he tried to set forth all his  assumptions clearly -at the beginning of his German booklet on the </p><div id="pagenum"><p>theory of parallels -the first three and the fifth were devoted to </p></div><div id="pagenum"><p>NON-EUCLIDEAN GEOMETRIES 63 </p></div><p id="page">expressing the essential properties of the straight line, and were  designed to leave no doubt as to the straightness of Lobachevsky's  straights.  (1) A straight line fits upon itself in all its positions. By this I mean that during the  revolution of the surface containing it the straight line does not change its place if it  goes through two unmoving points in the surface.  (2) Two straight lines cannot intersect in two points.  (3) A straight line sufficiently produced both ways must go out beyond all bounds.  and in such way cuts a bounded plane into two parts.  (5) A straight line always cuts another in going from one side of it over to the other  side.'9  Horocycles satisfy the last three statements, but not the first; this  suffices to show where lies the truth about genuine straight lines if  Postulate 5 is false. The decision to use the word 'straight' in the  sense set by the four postulates above is of course conventional, and  if it turns out that in the world there are no straight lines in this sense,  we will probably give up some of those postulates rather than do  without such a familiar word. (This is indeed what pilots do when  they speak of flying from Sydney straight to Vancouver.) But the  point here is that Lobachevsky's usage does not constitute a depar­ ture from the established conventions governing this word, con­ ventions which, as Proclus and most probably Euclid himself knew,  do not require that only such lines as fulfil Postulate 5 be called  straight -quite the contrary: it may very well happen that the lines  fulfilling this postulate are horocycles, which, by those conventions,  ought not to be called straight.  The indeterminateness of the characteristic constant of BL  geometry prompted attempts at determining it experimentally, on the  analogy of other physical constants familiar to 19th-century scientists.  The successful application of Euclidean geometry in science and in  everyday life indicated that the constant, if finite, must be very large.  Schweikart wrote that if the constant was equal to the radius of the  earth it would be practically infinite in comparison to the magnitudes  we deal with in everyday life (thus vindicating the use of Euclidean  geometry for ordinary purposes). Gauss commented that "in the light  of our astronomical experience, the constant must be enormously  larger (unermesslich grosser) than the radius of the earth".40  Lobachevsky tried to evaluate the constant by using astronomical </p><div id="pagenum"><p>data. Rather than look for an actual example of a line parallel to two </p></div><div id="pagenum"><p>64 CHAPTER 2 </p></div><p id="page">perpendicular straight lines and measure its distance to their inter­ section, he set out to calculate the constant indirectly, by measuring  the defect of a very large triangle. He found that the defect of the  triangle formed by Sirius, Rigel and Star No.29 of Eridanus was equal  to 3.727 x 10-6 seconds of are, a magnitude too small to be significant  given the range of observational error. He concluded that  "astronomical observations persuade us that all lines subject to our  measurements, even the distances between heavenly bodies, are too  small in comparison with the line which plays the role of a unit in our  theory, so that the usual equations of plane trigonometry must still be  viewed as correct, having no noticeable error".41  There is another side to Lobachevsky's empiricism which ought to  be mentioned here. He believed that the basic concepts of any  science -which, he said, should be clear and very few in number -are  acquired through our senses. 42 Geometry is built upon the concepts of  body and bodily contact, the latter being the only 'property' common  to all bodies that we ought to call geometrical. Lobachevsky arrives at  the familiar concepts of depthless surface, widthless line and dimen­ sionless point by considering different possible forms of bodily  contact and ignoring, per abstractionem, everything except the  contact itself. But then these "surfaces, lines and points, as defined in  geometry, exist only in our representation; whereas we actually  measure surfaces and lines by means of bodies".43 For "in nature  there are neither straight nor curved lines, neither plane nor curved  surfaces; we find in it only bodies, so that all the rest is created by our  imagination and exists just in the realm of theory".44 "In fact we  know nothing in nature but movement, without which sense im­ pressions are impossible. Consequently all other concepts, e.g.  geometrical concepts, are generated artificially by our understanding,  which derives them from the properties of movement; this is why  space in itself and by itself does not exist for us. ,,45 This leads  Lobachevsky to a most remarkable piece of speculation: since our  geometry is not based on a perception of space, but constructs a  concept of space from an experience of bodily movement produced  by physical forces, why could there not be a place in science for two  or more geometries, governing different kinds of natural forces?  To explain this idea, we assume that [ ... J attractive forces decrease because their effect  is diffused upon a spherical surface. In ordinary geometry the area of a spherical </p><div id="pagenum"><p>surface of radius r is equal to 417r, so that the force must be inversely proportional to </p></div><div id="pagenum"><p>NON-EUCLIDEAN GEOMETRIES 65 </p></div><p id="page">the square of the distance. I have found that in imaginary geometry the surface of a  sphere is equal to ?T(e' -e-,)2; such a geometry could possibly govern molecular  forces, whose variations would then entirely depend on the very large number e."  This is, of course, a mere supposition and stands in need of better  proof, "but this much at least is certain: that forces, and forces alone,  generate everything: movement, velocity, time, mass, even distances  and angles".46 Here we see Kant's youthful fantasy of 1746 (p.29)  making a new, much bolder, appearance. If forces, as Kant surmised,  determine (physical) geometry, we cannot expect the same geometry  to be everywhere applicable, for geometry must reflect the behaviour  of the forces prevailing at each level of reality.  There is one further question we must examine before leaving the  subject of the theory of parallels. What made Gauss, Bolyai and  Lobachevsky so certain that BL geometry contained no inconsis­ tency? The fact that no contradiction had been inferred despite their  efforts did not prove that none could ever arise. Lack of familiarity  with formalized deduction and deductive systems may have kept  these eminent mathematicians unaware of the pitfalls concealed even  in full-fledged axiomatic theories, whose assumptions have been made  wholly explicit. BL geometry was a fairly complex system, where  seemingly disparate lines of reasoning led to surprisingly harmonious  conclusions - a trait that normally inspires trust and arouses zeal in  mathematicians. Lobachevsky had also a more specific reason for  believing in the consistency of BL geometry, one that may also have  been known to Gauss and Bolyai, for they were familiar with the  mathematical fact on which it is based. In the conclusion to his first  published paper on the subject, Lobachevsky points out that after  deriving a set of equations labelled (17), which express the mutual  dependence of the sides and the angles of a BL triangle, he gave  general formulae for the elements of distance, area and volume,  so that, from now on, everything else in geometry will be analysis, wherein calculations  will necessarily agree and where nothing will be able to disclose to us something new,  i.e. something that was not contained in those first equations from which all relations  between geometrical magnitudes must be derived. Therefore, if somebody unflinchingly  maintains that a subsequently emerging contradiction will force us to reject the  principles we have assumed in this new geometry, such a contradiction must already be  contained in equations (17). Let us observe however that these equations become  equations (16) of spherical trigonometry as soon as we substutute av'( -I), bv'( -I),  cv' (-I) for sides a, b, c. But in ordinary geometry and in spherical trigonometry we  only encounter relations between lines; consequently, ordinary geometry, trigonometry </p><div id="pagenum"><p>and this new geometry will always stand in mutual agreement."" </p></div><div id="pagenum"><p>66 CHAPTER 2 </p></div><p id="page">In other words, the new geometry is at least as consistent as the old.  This argument for the relative consistency of BL geometry does not  involve the construction of a so-called Euclidean model of it, i.e. it  does not require us to understand its terms in some unnatural,  originally unintended sense -say, 'straight lines' as half-circles,  'planes' as some kind of curved surfaces, etc. For the argument  depends upon a purely formal agreement between two sets of equa­ tions, one of which is derived within BL geometry. Moreover, the  other set of equations does not belong specifically to Euclidean  geometry, any more than, say, the laws of arithmetic belong to it.  They are the basic equations of spherical trigonometry, which, as  Lobachevsky (and Bolyai) made a point of showing, does not depend  on Postulate 5. The geometry of great circles upon a sphere is  certainly true within Euclidean geometry, but it is equally true in BL  geometry, for it is part of that scientia spatii absolute vera that is built  upon the assumptions common to both geometries. Indeed, it seems  to me quite typical of Lobachevsky's posture that, when he needed a  formal argument to uphold the viability of his new geometry before  the partisans of the exclusive validity of the old, he should have  looked for it precisely in that part of geometry which was acceptable  to both sides. On the other hand, although our idea of a model was  not wholly foreign to him, he does not appear to have thought that  one could make BL geometry respectable by providing it with a  Euclidean model. His use of models aims, so to speak, in the opposite  direction, namely, at making Euclidean plane geometry plausible and  its early discovery and continued predominance understandable, by  showing how it is realized within the new geometry, although only as  a particular, extreme degenerate case.  *Formulae (17) of BL trigonometry, referred to above, are as  follows. In a triangle with sides a, b, c, opposite to angles A, B, C,  respectively:  tan I1(a) sin A = tan I1(b) sin B,  sin I1(b) sin I1(c) cos A cos I1(b) cos I1(c) = I - . I1() , sm a  A . B .

Contrary to Gauss' expectation,  no uproar was heard. Most mathematicians ignored the extravagent  Russian, but some took a deep interest in the new geometry. Postu­ late 5 had long been sensed by many as a mildly painful thorn in the  "supremely beutiful body of geometry" (to borrow Henry Savile's  words).l We thus find Bessel, in his reply to the letter where Gauss  expressed his fear of Boeotians, not unreceptive to the new ideas.  What Lambert has written and what Schweikart said have made it clear to me that our  geometry is incomplete and should be given a hypothetical correction, which vanishes  if the sum of the angles of a plane triangle eqnals 180 degrees. That would be the true  geometry, while Euclidean geometry would be the practical one, at least for figures on  the earth.2  A lively mathematical and philosophical discussion of the new  geometrical conceptions did not begin until the 1860's however, when  the fact that Gauss had been recommending them became generally  known through the publication of his correspondence with Schu­ macher. Interest in non-Euclidean geometry was on the rise when  Riemann's lecture of 1854 "On the Hypotheses which Lie at the Basis </p><div id="pagenum"><p>of Geometry" was finally printed in 1867. This work marks the </p></div><div id="pagenum"><p>68 CHAPTER 2 </p></div><p id="page">beginning of the modern philosophy of geometry and is the source of  some of its most characteristic ideas. We must therefore analyze it  with some care. To this end, we shall examine first some innovations  due to Gauss which led up to it.  In the next three sections, we shall speak about smooth curves and  surfaces in space which have no cusps or other singularities. We may  restrict our treatment to them because we shall be concerned with  general local properties of curves and surfaces, i.e. properties true of  a neighbourhood of an average point on them. We take space to be  the infinite three-dimensional continuum of classical geometry, in  which all Euclid's theorems are valid.  2.2.2 Curves and their Curvature  The theory of plane curves, initiated in a piecemeal fashion by the  Greeks, was developed in the 17th and 18th centuries with the full  generality allowed by the newly-introduced method of coordinate  geometry (Section 1.0.4). The study of direction, the most conspicuous  local property of a curve, played a major role in the discovery of the  calculus. The resources of this new mathematical discipline were used  for defining the length of a curve and for conceiving in an exact  quantitative fashion another important local property of plane curves,  namely curvature, which we may intuitively describe as the degree to  which a curve is bent at each point. In the 18th century, the new  methods were applied to the study of curves in space and, eventually,  to the study of surfaces. Following a pattern quite familiar in  mathematics, the concept of curvature, which had originally been  defined for plane curves on strongly intuitive grounds, was extended  analogically to space curves and surfaces, losing in this process most  of its intuitive feel.  It will be useful to introduce some technical terms. A path in space  is a mapping c of an interval of R into space, such that, for any Cartesian  mapping x, the composite mapping x . c is everywhere differentiable.  We shall usually consider injective paths c, such that, for any Cartesian  mapping x, x . c possesses everywhere derivatives of all orders.3 The  range of such a path always corresponds to our intuitive idea of a smooth  curve; on the other hand, curves that are smooth in the intuitive sense,  but which are not the range of any such path -e.g. closed curves, or  curves with double points such as the figure 8 -can always be viewed as </p><div id="pagenum"><p>the union of the possibly overlapping ranges of several paths of the kind </p></div><div id="pagenum"><p>NON-EUCLIDEAN GEOMETRIES 69 </p></div><p id="page">described. A single curve K can be the range of many paths, defined on  the same or on different intervals of R. If K is the range of two paths c  and c, related by the equation c = c . 'Y, 'Y is said to reparametrize the  curve K, 'parameter' being a term traditionally used to designate the  'variable' argument of a path. c and c are two 'parametrical represen­ tatio'ns' of K. Let c be a path defined on a closed interval [a, b], and let x  be a Cartesian mapping. We define the length of the curve c([a, b]) by  b  A(a, b) = f Iddu (x • C(U»I duo (1)  a  The integrand is, of course, the limit approached by the length of a  chord drawn from c(u) to a neighbouring point c(u + h) as h tends to  zero. The length A(a, b) is equal therefore to the limit of the sequence  (Ai) of the lengths of any sequence (Pi) of polygonal lines inscribed in  c([a, b]) between c(a) and c(b), whose sides grow shorter than any  arbitrary segment as i increases beyond all bounds. Under the condi­ tions imposed on x . c, this limit can be shown to exist. Since the  integrand is invariant under coordinate transformations and a  reparametrization is equivalent to a substitution of variables, the  above integral has a fixed value for a given curve, no matter how we  choose the mapping x . c that represents it. The length of the arc  joining c(a) to an arbitrary point c(u) in c([a, b]) is given by  u  A(U) = f Id~ (x' C(U»I duo (2)  a  The function UI-~A(U) reparametrizes the curve c([a, b]). Let c =  C • A. Path c is said to represent our curve as 'parametrized by arc  length'. The parameter, in this case, is usually denoted by s. Ob­ viously, Id(x . c(s»/dsl = 1. Hence  A (s) = f du = s,  o  as it ought to be. (3) </p><div id="pagenum"><p>Let c be an injective path defined on [0, k], with arc length as </p></div><div id="pagenum"><p>70 CHAPTER 2 </p></div><p id="page">parameter; let x be a Cartesian mapping. We assume that the range of  c lies entirely on a given plane, i.e. that it is a plane curve. As stakes  all the values between ° and k, the derivative d(x· c)/ds takes its  values in R3. Therefore, x-1(d(x • c(s»/ds) is a point in space. The  mapping c' = x-1(d(x • c)/ds) is a path, though not necessarily an  injective one. Since c([O, kD is parametrized by arc length, the range  of c' lies entirely on a circle of unit radius. If X is the origin of the  mapping x and P = c'(s), the directed segment XP is parallel to, and  has the same sense as, the tangent to c([O, k]) at c(s). For this reason,  we call c', c'(s) and c'([O, k]) the tangential images of c, c(s) and  c([O, k]), respectively. We will illustrate the significance of the  tangential image of a curve with the aid of a story. Suppose H is  an object moving at constant speed along the curve c([O, k]), passing  through point c(s) at time s. Let H' move simultaneously on the range  of c', so that at time s, H' is at c'(s). H', of course, need not move at a  constant speed; indeed, at times it may not move at all. But its  movements depend at every moment on the simultaneous move­ ments of H, through the equation relating c' to c. As the  direction in which H moves changes, the position of H' changes; if  the direction of H changes faster, H' moves faster. In other words,  the speed of H' at time s measures the degree to which curve c([O, kD  is bent at the point c(s). Consequently, the speed with which H'  moves along the range of c' measures what we may reasonably call  the curvature of c([O, k]) at each of its points. The speed of H' is  given by Id(x • c')/ds I. But this is equal to W(x • c)/ds21. The value of  this derivative at s does not depend on the mapping x. We take it as a  measure of the curvature or local 'bendedness' of our curve c([O, k]).  In the above discussion, the restriction to plane curves plays no  role, except that of motivating our choice of the name 'curvature' for  the property measured by Id2(x· c)/ds21. We may lift the restriction  and preserve the name, as 18th-century mathematicians did. The  range of c' is then no longer confined to a circle, but lies on a sphere  of unit radius. We define therefore the curvature K at a point c(s) of a  curve c([O, k]) parameterized by arc length, by  K(S) = W(x' c)/ds 2Isl, (4)  (where x is any Cartesian mapping). This definition immediately  suggests a concept of total curvature KT, measuring the total change </p><div id="pagenum"><p>of direction of curve c([O, k]) as we go from point C(SI) to point C(S2); </p></div><div id="pagenum"><p>NON-EUCLIDEAN GEOMETRIES 71 </p></div><p id="page">namely  '2  KT(St. S2) = f K(S) ds. (5)  '\  But K(S) is equal to Id(x . c')/dslsl, so that  '2  KT(St. S2) = f Id(x . c')/dslsl ds. (6)  '\  The total curvature of c([st. S2]) is therefore equal to the length of the  tangential image c'([st. S2]).  We have defined the curvature of a curve at a point as the  magnitude of an element of R3, i.e. as a non-negative real number. In  the case of plane curves, it is possible to define a signed curvature.  Mathematicians have not failed to use this possibility in order to  convey, through the value of the curvature, one more item of in­ formation about the curve. Orientation conventions establish a posi­ tive and a negative sense of rotation about a point in the plane. The  signed curvature iCes) at the point c(s) is equal to K(S) if the tangent  to the curve at c(s) is constant or rotates about c(s) in a positive  sense; iCes) = - K(S) if the tangent at c(s) rotates about this point in a  negative sense.  2.2.3 Gaussian Curvature of Surfaces  As we did with smooth curves, we shall make our notion of a smooth  surface more precise by imposing certain conditions on the admissible  analytical representations of such surfaces. Let yi and Zi denote the ith  projection functions on R2 and R3, respectively.4 Let { be a connec­ ted, open or closed region of R 2 and f: { ~ R 3 a differentiable function  such that the matrix [a(zi • f)layi] (i = 1,2,3; j = 1,2) everywhere has  rank 2. If x is any Cartesian mapping, X-I. f = «l> maps { into space. If  «l> is injective and, for any Cartesian mapping x, x . «l> everywhere  possesses partial derivatives of all orders, «l>({) is what we would  normally call a smooth surface. Although not every smooth surface  can be wholly represented as the range of some injective mapping of  this kind, any point on such a surface has a neighbourhood which is </p><div id="pagenum"><p>thus representable. The full surface can then be pieced together from </p></div><div id="pagenum"><p>72 CHAPTER 2 </p></div><p id="page">the ranges of several such mappings. Our discussion will be restricted  to surfaces or pieces of surfaces which are, in each case, the range of  a mapping ell defined on an open region {C R2 and subject to the  stated conditions. Results obtained under this restriction are not  always true of a surface composed of several such pieces. Our  discussion pertains therefore to the local geometry of surfaces and  not to their global geometry.  It can be shown that, if S = ella) is a smooth surface and P = eIl(a, b 2  is a point on it, there exists a plane Sp which contains the tangents  at P to all curves on S through that point. Sp can be naturally viewed as a  2-dimensional vector space with P for its zero vector. It is then called the  tangent plane of S at P. H 7T is a plane through P normal to Sp, the  intersection of 7T and S is a plane curve called a nonnal section of S at P.  Every normal section of S at P possesses a signed curvature at P. The set  of these curvatures is a bounded set of real numbers. In 1760, Leonhard  Euler (1707-1783) proved that this set has a maximum Kmax and a  minimum Kmin, and that Kmax and Kmin are the signed curvatures at P of two  mutually perpendicular normal sections. The tangents of these curves at  P are called the principal directions of surface S at P. By a mild abuse of  language, Kmax and Kmin are called the principal curvatures of surface Sat  P. Euler proved also that if I is a normal section of S at P, whose tangent  at P makes an angle cp with the principal direction associated with Kmax,  the signed curvature K of I is given by  (1)  Consider now a Cartesian mapping x with ongm O. The sphere  with centre 0 and unit radius has a unique diameter Q\Q2 normal to  Sp. Orientation conventions enable us to choose one of the points Qi  (i = 1, 2) as a unique representative of Sp.5 We call the chosen point  the normal image of surface S at P = eIl(a, b), and denote it by n(a, b).  It is clear that (u, v) t--+ n(u, v) maps { onto a connected subset of the  unit sphere with centre O. We call n({) the normal image of surface  S. Gauss defined the total curvature of a surface S = eIl({) as the area  of its normal image n({). This definition is a rather natural analogical  extension of our definition of the total curvature of a curve as the  length of its tangential image. We arrived at that definition by in­ tegrating (local) curvature, eqn. (6) of Section 2.2.2. Gauss proposed a  concept of curvature of a surface at a point, which bears a similar </p><div id="pagenum"><p>relation to his concept of total curvature of a surface. He writes: </p></div><div id="pagenum"><p>NON-EUCLIDEAN GEOMETRIES 73 </p></div><p id="page">To each part of a curved surface enclosed within definite limits we assign a total or  integral curvature, which is represented by the area of the figure on the sphere  corresponding to it.6 From this integral curvature must be distinguished the somewhat  more specific curvature which we shall call the measure of curvature. The latter refers  to a point of the surface, and shall denote the quotient obtained when the integral  curvature of the surface element about a point is divided by the area of the element  itself; and hence it denotes the ratio of the infinitely small areas which correspond to  one another on the curved surface and on the sphere.'  Gauss may seem to be defining the 'measure of curvature' k of  S = <I>«() at <1>( a, b) by  k(a, b) = lim area of n({).  (->(a.b) area of <I>«() (2)  This expression is meaningless unless we have a satisfactory  definition of the area of a curved surface. We may grant that Gauss  possessed such a definition in pectore, given that in § 17 of the  Disquisitiones generales circa superficies curvas he provided the basis  for the classical theory of surface area. But even if we grant this, and  assume all the conceptual refinements required to make that definition  truly unimpeachable, it is not obvious that the above limit exists or  that it is independent of the way how { contracts to (a, b). But Gauss'  text does not really speak of such a limit. It does not refer to a  sequence of ratios of functionally related areas allegedly converging  to a 'measure of curvature'. Gauss defines the 'measure of curva­ ture' simply as the ratio between 'elements of surface' of n({) and  <I>({), respectively; that is, as the ratio of integrands, the integral of  the first of which, taken over all (, is equal to the area of n«(), and the  integral of the second of which, taken over all (, is equal to the area  of <1>(,). This may sound even more perplexing than our earlier inter­ pretation, for it amounts to -horribile dictu -dividing one infinitesi­ mally small quantity by another. But Gauss, trusting in his own  instinct and in the intelligence of his successors, leaves it at that and  immediately proceeds to contrive a method for calculating the said  ratio.8 It is based on the following: the tangent plane Sp of S at  P = <I>(a, b) is parallel to the plane tangent to the unit sphere at  Q = n(a, b), for the radius OQ is, by definition, perpendicular to Sp;  therefore, reasons Gauss, given a Cartesian mapping x, with frame  (?T\, ?T2, ?T3), the ratio of the perpendicular projections on, say, ?Tit of </p><div id="pagenum"><p>the 'elements of surface' of n«() and <1>(,) must be equal to the ratio </p></div><div id="pagenum"><p>74 CHAPTER 2 </p></div><p id="page">of the 'elements of surface' themselves. The calculation of the ratio  of the said perpendicular projections is, for Gauss, an easy matter.  After obtaining a formula enabling the calculation of his 'measure  of curvature', or G-curvature (G for Gaussian), as we shall hence­ forth call it, Gauss derives a series of beautiful theorems. One of them  states that the G-curvature of a surface S at a point P is always equal  to the product of the two principal curvatures of S at P. Since Euler's  results (mentioned on p.72) are perspicuous and fairly easy to  prove, nothing could be simpler than using this result of Gauss' as a  definition of G-curvature, whereby we would avoid the difficulties of  the original Gaussian definition. This procedure is followed by some  authors. The untutored reader often fails to understand why this  particular number deserves to be called the curvature of the surface.  Why not take the average of, or the difference between the principal  curvatures? Why care for the principal curvatures at all? They are  nothing but the curvatures of certain plane curves. Why use them to  characterize surfaces? Singling out G-curvature among the local fea­ tures of surfaces is justified ex post facto by the stupendous fruitful­ ness of that concept. Yet, while Gauss' train of thought gives us  reason enough to expect this (for he defines G-curvature as a natural  extension to surfaces of an important concept of the theory of  curves), when G-curvature is defined as Kmax times Kmin its remarkable  properties appear as a piece of sheer good luck. There is of course a  didactic tradition which prefers this way of doing mathematics,  patterning it after the juggler's craft, not the poet's art.  A second theorem proved by Gauss has particular importance in  connection with our main topic. Let A, B, C be three points on a  surface <I>«(), joined by arcs of shortest length.9 Let a, {3, 'Y be the  interior angles of the curvilinear triangle ABC formed by these arcs.  The real number (a + (3 + 'Y -1T) is called the excess of triangle ABC  if it is positive, the defect if it is negative. Gauss proved that triangles  formed by shortest arcs on surfaces of positive curvature always  have an excess while those formed on a surface of negative curvature  always have a defect, the excess or defect being proportional to the  area of the nonnal image of the triangle (i.e. to its total curvature).  This result, published in 1827, if read in the light of the contemporary  discoveries by Bolyai, Lobachevsky and Gauss himself, ought to have  suggested a surface of negative G-curvature as a model of plane BL </p><div id="pagenum"><p>geometry. \0 It is all the more remarkable that such a model was not </p></div><div id="pagenum"><p>NON-EUCLIDEAN GEOMETRIES 75 </p></div><p id="page">discovered until forty years later, when it was proposed by Eugenio  Beltrami (Section 2.3.7).  Three simple examples will illustrate the intuitive content of the  concept of G-curvature. If cI>({) is a plane, n({) is a point and  G-curvature is therefore constant and equal to zero. If cI>({) is a  sphere of radius r, n({) is the full unit sphere; the area of cI>({) is then  r2 times that of n({) and the G-curvature of cI>({) is constant and equal  to l/r2. These results seem quite reasonable. Let us now consider a  thick roll of wallpaper with a pattern consisting of transverse stripes  (parallel to the roll's axis). Let us see if we can determine the  G-curvature at a point on the coiled paper surface. Along the edge of  a stripe the tangent plane remains constant; so the normal image of  the edge is a point. The same is true of any other transverse line on  the paper, i.e. any line parallel to that edge. If a point moves on the  paper otherwise than along a transverse line, it continuously goes  from one transverse line to another and its normal image describes a  line - a circular arc -on the unit sphere. Since the area of a line is  zero, the G-curvature of the wallpaper surface is everywhere equal to  zero. This will not change if we pack the paper more or less tightly or  if we unroll it to paste it on a wall. Moreover, if the wall is smooth  and the paper, when pasted on it, fits snugly without needing to be  stretched or shrunk the curvature of the surface will remain constant  and equal to zero no matter what the wall's shape. (The tangent plane  may now change as we move horizontally, along the transverse  stripes of the paper, but it will usually remain constant along the  vertical lines; if the wall is so warped that its tangent plane varies  simultaneously in both the vertical and the horizontal direction, the  paper will not fit on the wall unless we stretch some parts of it and cut  away others.) This result is quite surprising and certainly disqualifies  G-curvature as a measure of what we would ordinarily call the  curvature or 'bendedness' of a surface. The break between the  mathematical and the intuitive concepts of curvature, noticeable in  the case of space curves, is now complete. But this should not detract  us from using the mathematical concept, for, as Gauss writes, "less  depends upon the choice of words than upon this, that their intro­ duction shall be justified by pregnant theorems".11 And the theorem  which our wallpaper example illustrates is pregnant indeed with </p><div id="pagenum"><p>portentous ideas. </p></div><div id="pagenum"><p>76 CHAPTER 2 </p></div><p id="page">2.2.4 Gauss' Theorema Egregium and the Intrinsic Geometry of  Surfaces  Plane geometry is usually taught at school as if no third spatial  dimension existed. Euclidean plane geometry can be developed as  what we might call the 'intrinsic' geometry of the plane, which studies  the plane's structure purely in terms of itself, disregarding its relations  to the space outside it. This becomes evident if we examine the special  kind of Cartesian mappings used in plane coordinate geometry,  characterizing them in terms of the Cartesian mappings we defined in  Section 1.0.4. When applying the method of coordinates to plane  geometry, we consider only mappings x = (x I, x2, x3) such that x3 =  constant, i.e. such that the reference plane tT3 is parallel to the plane TI  on which we carry out our investigations; consequently, the third  coordinate of every point may be considered irrelevant and dis­ regarded. The first two coordinates are, for each point P on TI,  identical with the distance from P to the mutually perpendicular lines  Al and A2 at which TI intersects tTl and tT2, respectively. In plane  geometry, our Cartesian mappings of space onto R3 can be (and in  actual geometrical practice are) replaced by mappings of the plane  onto R2, which are referred, not to a triad of mutually orthogonal  planes, but to a pair of perpendicular straight lines, the axes of the  mapping. We shall call this kind of mapping a Cartesian 2-mapping.  The full import of this approach to plane geometry will perhaps  more easily be grasped if we go back to the wallpaper example we  introduced toward the end of the preceding section. Suppose now that  a remarkably enterprising school principal resolves to decorate some  of the classrooms in his school with specially designed wallpaper  displaying a course of elementary plane geometry. After the paper is  pasted on the flat classroom walls, the figures illustrating the proof of  each theorem will look not much different than they do in the ordinary  chalk-and-blackboard course, only more neatly printed and  adequately drawn. Some of the figures will perhaps be such that  merely from looking at them we will find the accompanying state­ ments obvious. While the wallpaper lies rolled up in the school's  storage room, the statements printed on them do not seem so obvious.  My question is: are they any the less true? Or consider Fig. 9  illustrating Euclid's proof of Pythagoras' theorem. Tear out the page </p><div id="pagenum"><p>and roll it in any way you wish, or make a dunce cap out of it. Does </p></div><div id="pagenum"><p>NON-EUCLIDEAN GEOMETRIES 77 </p></div><p id="page">E  o  J  F G H  Fig. 9.  the area of figure ABHF cease being equal to the sum of the areas of  ACED and BCIJ? Certainly not, provided the paper has not been  stretched or shrunk. Moreover, every step in Euclid's proof retains its  validity when referred to the rolled up figure, e.g. that AB = AF and  CA = AD and even, in a sense which may initially elude us, that angle  BAD is equal to angle CAF, and that there/ore the area of AKGF is  equal to that of ACED. If the reader is not persuaded let him check  the proof by the method of coordinates. He may choose as axes the  top and side edges of the page. On the dunce cap both will become  curved lines, as will the perpendiculars drawn from them to any point  of the figure. But the latter will preserve their lengths and they will  continue to meet the axes orthogonally at the same points. The  Cartesian 2-mapping now maps the surface of the dunce cap into R 2.  But the value assigned to each point is the same as it was, so that all  the equations used in the proof remain true. We can check by this  method any proof on the wallpaper rolls and obtain similar results.  We now see that the G-curvature function, in assigning the same  constant value 0 to the points of the plane and those of a rolled  surface, does not behave in an arbitrary, geometrically irrelevant  fashion. On the contrary, these two kinds of surface, like all surfaces  of zero G-curvature, are so closely related, that, when viewed 'in­ trinsically' as two-dimensional expanses, apart from their relations to  the space outside, they must be regarded as geometrically equivalent </p><div id="pagenum"><p>(at least locally, i.e. on a neighbourhood of each point). Curiously </p></div><div id="pagenum"><p>78 CHAPTER 2 </p></div><p id="page">enough, G-curvature itself does not seem to be an intrinsic property  of surfaces, for it is defined in terms of the varying spatial position of  the tangent plane at different points of a surface. Why then is  G-curvature identical in surfaces which intrinsically are indeed  geometrically equivalent but which extrinsically, in terms of their  relations to the rest of space, are not at all equivalent? Does this  happen only to sudaces of zero curvature, whose peculiar relation to  outer space measured by G-curvature is null or non-existent? Gauss'  most remarkable discovery in his study of curved surfaces -theorem a  egregium, as he called it -states that this happens not exclusively to  sudaces of zero curvature, but universally to all sudaces. To make  this statement more precise we must first define exactly what it is, in  the general case, for the intrinsic geometrical structure of two sur­ faces to be equivalent. Let us recall our argument illustrating the  geometrical equivalence between the plane and the surface of a roll.  It rested essentially on the following fact: if ~ is an injective differen­ tiable mapping of a region, of R 2 onto a part of the rolled sud ace and  x is a Cartesian 2-mapping of the plane, it can happen that cI>. x  maps any straight line segment on the plane onto an arc of the same  length on the rolled sudace. An analogous relation between any two  sudaces 'I'('7}), 'I'(n can easily be exhibited. Let f: R2~R2 be a  distance-preserving mapping l2 such that f( '7}) c ,; then, e = ~ . f • '1'-1  is an isometric mapping or an isometry of '1'( '7}) into ~(') if and only  if, for any arc A on 'I'('7}), A and 8(A) have the same length. We say  that two sudaces are isometrically related or isometric if there exists  an isometry that maps one into the other. 'Geometric equivalence' in  the sense suggested above is, strictly speaking, isometric relatedness.  Gauss' theorem a egregium can now be stated thus: if two surfaces SI  and S2 are isometric, G; is the G-curvature function on Si (i = 1, 2),  and f is an isometry of S) into S2, then G2 • f = GI• We put this briefly  by saying that G-curvature is invariant under isometries, or  isometrically invariant. This result shows that G-curvature is a quite  significant geometrical concept. In preparation for his proof of the  theorem in the Disquisitiones generales of 1827, Gauss developed the  means for studying any sud ace 'intrinsically', heedless of its relations  to the three-dimensional space in which it is embedded. This  development provided the groundwork for the generalized geometry  of Riemann. </p><div id="pagenum"><p>In a paper of 1825 published posthumously, 13 Gauss proves his </p></div><div id="pagenum"><p>NON-EUCLIDEAN GEOMETRIES 79 </p></div><p id="page">theorema egregium as a consequence of the theorem (stated on p.74)  which equates the excess or defect of a triangle bounded by shortest  arcs on a surface to the total curvature of the region enclosed by that  triangle. This discovery must have seemed paradoxical, for isometric  relatedness was so obviously independent of the spatial position of  the isometric surfaces, while G-curvature, as we pointed out above,  was defined in terms of that position. But in his tract of 1827, Gauss  showed that G-curvature could be calculated from certain isometric­ ally invariant functions which suffice to determine what is usually  called the 'intrinsic geometry' of the surface, i.e. its isometrically  invariant structure.14 These functions arise when we look for a  general expression for arc length on a surface. We shall consider a  surface <I>«(), where <I> is an injective mapping of an open region of R2  into space, fulfilling the conditions stated on p.71. An arc on <I>«()  joining two points P and Q is the range of some injective path  c([a, b]) subject to the condition stated on p.68, such that c(a) = P and  c(b) = Q. Since c([a, b]) lies wholly on <I>«(), there exists an injective  mapping c: [a, b) ~ ( with derivatives of all orders, such that c =  <I> • c. Given any Cartesian mapping x, the length of c([a, b]) is given  by  b b  sea, b) = f I:t (x' c) 1,1 dt = f I:t (x' <1>. C)I,I dt, (1)  a a  where the integrand, as we know, does not depend on the choice of x.  Let cp = x • <1>; cp maps (C R2 into R3. For each (u, v) E (, we write  cp(u, v) = (CPI(U, v), CP2(U, v), CP3(U, v». For each t E [a, b], we write  c(t) = (CI(t), C2(t». With this notation the integrand in eqn. (1) is  given by  I:t (cp' C)I = I(~ (:t (cp;' C)YY12I= I(~ (~~~; ~rrl  (2)  Regrouping terms in the last expression and writing  3 (" )2 G=L ~ , </p><div id="pagenum"><p>;=1 iJC2 (3) </p></div><div id="pagenum"><p>80 CHAPTER 2 </p></div><p id="page">we obtain  In order to put the above into more familiar notation, we now adopt a  different, otherwise revealing point of view. Since ell is injective it has  an inverse ell-I, which maps the surface eIlU) injectively onto the open  region C C R2. To each point P on eIl(C), ell-I assigns a pair of real  numbers (u(P), v(P» which we shall call the coordinates of P by the  chart cI>-I. (The functions P ~ U(P) and P ~ v(P) are called the first and  second coordinate functions of the chart.) Since c = ell-I. c, it is  obvious that CI = u . c and C2 = V • c. If we put CI = u and C2 = v, we  obtain upon substituting in (4) the well-known expression for arc  length on a surface eIl(C):  s(a,b)= j ds= jl(E(~~y+2F~~~~+G(~~Y)"l (5)  a  The integrand is called the line element on cI>(C) and is customarily  expressed thus:  (6)  E, F and G are continuous functions on C, whose values at a point  c(t) = (u(t), v(t» do not depend on the choice of c.  Gauss' 1827 proof of his theorema egregium consists essentially  in showing that the G-curvature function on eIl(C) can be defined in  terms of E, F and G. The proof is achieved by sheer force of  calculation and we need not go into it. Gauss also establishes in terms  of E, F and G, differential equations which must be satisfied by arcs  of shortest length on eIl(C).IS The result is then used to prove the  theorem relating total curvature to triangular excess or defect. E, F  and G also enter essentially into the expression for angular measure  on eIl(C). It seems that if we view E, F and G as three arbitrary  (though well-behaved) functions on C, and forget their original  definition in terms of a Cartesian mapping x, we could regard the  matrix [; ~] as characteristic of the surface cI>(C) and fully deter­ mining its intrinsic geometry. We may accept this, subject to one very </p><div id="pagenum"><p>important qualification: the above matrix depends essentially on the </p></div><div id="pagenum"><p>NON-EUCLIDEAN GEOMETRIES S1 </p></div><p id="page">representation of the surface as the range of a mapping <1>, or, to put it  the other way around, as the domain of a chart <1>-1. We can never­ theless easily establish how  [E . <1>-1 F . <1>-1]  F· <1>-1 G. <1>-1  transforms when a different chart is substituted for <1>-1, or, to use the  technical expression, how it transforms 'under a transformation of  coordinates'. We could therefore conceive the intrinsic geometry of a  ·surface as defined by an infinite set of such matrices, transforming  into one another according to definite rules. This conception is indeed  clumsy, but many physicists and most engineers have managed to live  with it to this day. On the other hand, the line element on the surface,  although it was expressed above in chart-dependent fashion, is actu­ ally invariant under coordinate transformations. This suggests that we  regard the line element as the function which characterizes the  intrinsic geometry of the surface, and each matrix [: ~] as a  'decomposition' of it, relative to one of the many admissible charts.  But this is not quite so simple as it sounds. The line element is indeed  a function, for it maps something into R. But the something mapped is  not the set of points on the surface. At each point the line element  indicates, so to speak, the local contribution to the length of each arc  passing through the point; this contribution is indeed the same for all  arcs passing through the point in a certain direction, but it is usually  different for arcs passing through it in different directions. The line  element at each point P of a surface S is therefore a function on the  set of directions through P in the tangent plane Sp. If we wish to find  a mathematical entity defined on S and fully characterizing its in­ trinsic geometry, we shall do well to look for a mapping assigning to  each point P on S a function on the said set. We shall soon learn to  regard a surface S as a two-dimensional differentiable manifold  (p.SS). Mappings of the required sort are called covariant tensor  fields on S.  Gauss' treatment of the intrinsic geometry of surfaces suggests an  idea which the non-mathematical reader ought to consider carefully at  this point. Let <I>«() = S be a smooth surface, as before. If x is a  Cartesian 2-mapping, x-I«) is an open, connected region of the </p><div id="pagenum"><p>Euclidean plane. Call it Q. Let 'It = X-I. <1>-1. 'It maps S injectively </p></div><div id="pagenum"><p>82 CHAPTER 2 </p></div><p id="page">onto Q. Arcs, closed regions and angles in S are mapped by 'I' onto  arcs, closed regions and (usually curvilinear) angles in Q. Let the  'length' of an arc ..\ in Q be equal to the length of '1'-1(..\), the 'area' of  a region A of Q be equal to the area of 'I'-I(A), the 'size' of an angle a  in Q be the size of 'I'-I(a), etc. These conventions establish what we  may call a quasigeometry on Q. By a judicious distribution of in­ verted commas we can now convert every theorem of the intrinsic  geometry of S into a true statement of the quasigeometry of Q. To  speak more straightforwardly, we shall say that the bijective mapping  'I' induces in a region of the plane the intrinsic geometry of surface  S.16 The whole procedure can be conceived in a more general way: let  <1>(0 = Sand <1>'(0 = S' be any two surfaces; obviously <1>'. <1>-1 in­ duces on S' the intrinsic geometry of S. This idea can be extended to  any set S endowed with an arbitrary structure G. If 1 maps S  bijectively onto a set S', 1 can be said to induce G in S', since every  true sentence P«Xj)iEl) concerning a family of points of S will be  uniquely correlated with a true sentence 'P'«f(X;)bl) concerning a  family of points of S'. Since the same subset of S' can be, say, a  'straight line' by virtue of one such mapping 1 and the 'interior of a  sphere' by virtue of another mapping g, familiarity with these  methods and points of view can easily lead one to think that geometry  is just a matter of terminological convention. 17  2.2.5 Riemann's Problem 01 Space and Geometry  Bernhard Riemann (1826-1866), a student of theology who converted  to mathematics in Gottingen, obtained his doctoral degree in 1851  under Gauss with a dissertation on the theory of functions of a  complex variable. In order to become habilitiert, i.e. licensed as a  university instructor, he submitted a second tract, "On the possibility  of representing a function by a trigonometric series" (1853). The final  requirement for habilitation was to deliver a public lecture before the  full faculty of philosophy. Of the three subjects proposed by  Riemann, the first two were related to his former essays, but Gauss,  acting on behalf of the faculty, quite unusually passed them up and  opted for the last, the foundations of geometry. This choice was  probably Gauss' last but not least contribution to the field. Had he  instead acted strictly according to precedent, Riemann's lecture  "Ueber die Hypothesen, welche der Geometrie zu Grunde liegen" </p><div id="pagenum"><p>would never have been written. It was read on June 10, 1854. Perhaps </p></div><div id="pagenum"><p>NON-EUCLIDEAN GEOMETRIES 83 </p></div><p id="page">it was as a concession to his non-mathematical audience that Riemann  omitted all formal derivations. It is, however, unlikely that he was in a  position to give them all, with the full clarity with which they can be  given nowadays, after a century of efforts by noteworthy mathemati­ cians.18 But this does not detract from the greatness of Riemann's  achievement, for nearly all his unproved and prima facie obscure  mathematical claims can be translated into intelligible and demon­ strable statements.19 The same cannot be said of his epistemological  conclusions, on whose very meaning all philosophers are not agreed.  Riemann begins by pointing out a feature common to all the  traditional presentations of geometry: that they presuppose the  concept of space and the fundamental concepts used in spatial  constructions. The purely nominal definitions of these basic  concepts -e.g. Euclid's definitions of point and straight line -shed no  light on the supposedly essential properties and relations ascribed to  these concepts in the axioms of geometry. Consequently, one fails to  perceive any necessity in jointly assuming all these presuppositions;  moreover, one does not even see whether their joint assertion is at all  tenable. Riemann believes that in order to dispel this obscurity from  the foundations of geometry we must clarify the general concept of  which space is just a particular instance. That general concept he  describes as the concept of a mUltiply extended quantity (mehrfach  ausgedehnte Grosse). He proposes to "construct" it from "general  quantitative concepts". This construction will show that an n-fold  extended quantity admits of diverse "metric relations" (Maassver­ hiiltnisse), "so that space constitutes only a special case of a  threefold extended quantity".20  These introductory remarks deserve careful attention. Riemann  obviously does not use the term 'space' in the very broad sense in  which it is used nowadays by mathematicians. 'Space' is, in his  words, the space, der Raum, a unique entity which is the site of  physical bodies and the locus of physical movements. We saw in  Section 1.0.3 that space, in this sense, was originally conceived as a  repository of geometrical points, whose existence ensured the ap­ plicability of Euclidean geometry in natural science. If one knows of  other geometries, it is reasonable to ask whether the Euclidean  system is in every respect the one best suited for the description of  natural phenomena. In the context of space metaphysics, this ques­</p><div id="pagenum"><p>tion naturally takes the form: What geometry is true of space? The </p></div><div id="pagenum"><p>84 CHAPTER 2 </p></div><p id="page">meaning and scope of this question will be considerably clarified if we  consider space as an instance of a broader genus, each of whose  species is characterized by a geometry. Such is the approach sugges­ ted by Riemann's initial remarks and outlined in the rest of his  lecture. Riemann does not hesitate to describe space as a "threefold  extended quantity". However it is not the only conceivable quantity  of this kind, for the genus "threefold extended quantity" can be  specified by several alternative "metric relations". Riemann assumes  that space is characterized by a definite system of such relations  which unambiguously determines the ratios between all pairs of  homogeneous spatial magnitudes. This is tantamount to a geometry.  Since space admits of but one such system and many more are  thinkable, the true geometry of space cannot be determined by  conceptual analysis alone. Riemann concludes that "those properties  which distinguish space from other conceivable threefold extended  quantities can be gathered only from experience".21  Riemann proposes next the following fundamental problem: "To  find out the simplest facts from which the metric relations of space  can be determined". This task has a purely conceptual side which  consists in pointing out the structural features of a multiply extended  quantity that are sufficient to determine its specific "metric relations".  But if Riemann is right, it has an empirical side as well, to be settled  by experimental research into physical phenomena. Euclid's postu­ lates together with his tacit assumptions describe one such system of  simple facts, which suffice to establish, through Pythagoras' theorem,  the metric relations of space. But, in view of the foregoing, we cannot  expect to deduce these facts from general quantitative concepts. This  implies, according to Riemann, that they are "not necessr.ry, but  possess only empirical certainty: they are hypotheses,,?2 Even if we  grant that their likelihood is enormous within the bounds of obser­ vation, their applicability beyond these bounds, either on the side of  the very large or on that of the very small, remains an open question.  In the remaining sixteen pages of his lecture Riemann carries out a  sizeable part of the programme sketched in the first two. He  complains that he has obtained very little help from previous writers - only a few short hints in a paper by Gauss and "some philosophical  investigations by Herbart" have guided him in his work. The lecture  is divided into three parts: the first is concerned with the general </p><div id="pagenum"><p>concept of an n-fold extended quantity; the second explores the </p></div><div id="pagenum"><p>NON-EUCLIDEAN GEOMETRIES 85 </p></div><p id="page">mathematical problem of determining the simplest facts that govern  metric relations on such quantities; the third deals with "applications  to space".  2.2.6 The Concept of a Manifold  Riemann conceives an n-fold extended quantity as a particular in­ stance of a more general sort of entity which he calls a Mannig­ faltigkeit. The English equivalent of this word is manifold. Both  words are used in present day mathematics in a narrower sense.  Confusion may arise because this technical sense of manifold agrees  fairly well with what Riemann had in mind when he spoke of an n-fold  extended quantity. A manifold, in Riemann's sense, is rather like  what we would nowadays call a set -although the empty set and sets  of a single element presumably would not have counted as manifolds  in his eyes. We shall put quotation marks around manifold when we  use it in the latter sense. Riemann introduces this notion of a  "manifold" in a somewhat peculiar way. Quantitative concepts he  says are applicable only if a genus is given, and the latter can be  specified in a variety of ways. The specifications of the genus consti­ tute a "manifold", which is continuous if there is a continuous  transition from one specification to another, or discrete if there is not.  Specifications constituting a discrete "manifold" are called the  elements of the "manifold"; those forming a continuous "manifold"  are called its points.23 Although Riemann admits the possibility that  space might ultimately be a discrete "manifold", he concerns himself  almost exclusively with continuous "manifolds".  Riemann can give only two commonplace examples of continuous  "manifolds", namely, colours, and "the locations of the objects of  sense" (die Orte der Sinnengegenstiinde). But higher mathematics  supplies a vast array of them. Riemann apparently believes that they  all fall into two classes: n-fold extended quantities (for some positive  integer n) and what we may call infinitely extended quantities. The  latter are mentioned in passing, towards the end of Part I. While a  point of an n-fold extended quantity can be referred to by an n-tuple  of real numbers (Grossenbestimmungen, i.e. "determinations of  magnitude", in Riemann's words), you need a sequence of real  numbers or even a whole continuous manifold of them to specify a  point in an infinitely extended quantity. Riemann says nothing further </p><div id="pagenum"><p>about the latter,24 so we shall ignore them and deal only with n-fold </p></div><div id="pagenum"><p>86 CHAPTER 2 </p></div><p id="page">extended quantities. Since each point of these can be referred to by  an element of R", it might seem possible to characterize an n-fold  extended quantity as a set that can be mapped injectively into R". But  this characterization is doubly inadequate. On the one hand it is too  broad: the injective mappings of n-fold extended quantities into R"  must fulfil certain additional conditions. On the other hand, when  these conditions are added, our characterization becomes unneces­ sarily restrictive. Riemann obviously conceives the mapping of an  n-fold extended quantity S into R", which furnishes each point of S  with its own exclusive real n-tuple, as a continuous mapping, i.e. one  that maps neighbouring points of S on neighbouring points in R".  Although he does not define neighbourhood in S, he makes use of  such a concept when speaking of a "continuous transition" from each  point of S to the others. But it is not only continuity of the mapping  that is required. Riemann's discussion in Part II is based on the  assumption that an n-fold extended quantity S can be mapped in­ jectively into R" in many differe.nt ways, and that if f and g are two  such mappings the composite mapping f· g-I is everywhere differen­ tiable to a suitably high order. Riemann probably thought that the  latter condition was implied by the requirement of continuity, but we  now know that it is not. As we said earlier, the characterization of  n-fold extended quantities as manifolds injectable into R", when  qualified by these further requirements, is too restrictive. Thus, for  example, there exists no injective mapping which assigns neighbour­ ing pairs of real numbers to all neighbouring points of a sphere. But  Riemann would certainly have considered the sphere as a twofold  extended quantity -indeed, he gives it as one of his examples in Part  11.5. The solution of this difficulty was suggested on p.7lf.: an n-fold  extended quantity may be conceived as composed of many pieces,  each of which can be mapped injectively onto a part of R n, the  mappings being subject to the two additional conditions mentioned  above. An n-fold extended quantity, thus understood, is what we  nowadays call an n-dimensional (real) differentiable manifold. This is  defined as an abstract set M, associated with a collection A (an atlas)  of injective mappings (or charts), each of which maps a part of M  onto an open subset of R", so that (i) each point of M is included in the  domain of at least one chart of the atlas, and (ii) if f and g are two  charts of the atlas, the composite mapping f . g-I is differentiable to a </p><div id="pagenum"><p>suitably high order on g(dom f ndom g).23 A composite mapping such </p></div><div id="pagenum"><p>NON-EUCLIDEAN GEOMETRIES 87 </p></div><p id="page">as I· g-I is known as a 'coordinate transformation' of the manifold  (M, A). We shall hereafter require coordinate transformations to have  partial derivatives of all orders. It is fairly easy to show rigorously  how an (n + I)-dimensional manifold can be constructed from a one­ dimensional and an n-dimensional one, which Riemann explains more  or less intuitively in Part 1.2; or how any n-dimensional manifold can  be analyzed into submanifolds of dimensions 1 and n -1, which is  sketched by him in Part 1.3. But it must be realized that since  n-dimensional differentiable manifolds possess a rather peculiar struc­ ture, not every "manifold" (in Riemann's sense) which may be  regarded as continuous in some non-trivial way will necessarily fall  into one of the two classes of continuous "manifolds" Riemann  acknowledged, i.e. n-fold and infinitely extended quantities.  *Two additional remarks on differentiable manifolds are in order  here. In the first place, we need not assume that the abstract set M is  in any sense continuous, for continuity in M comes about automatic­ ally, more or less in the following way. Given an atlas A on M, there  is a unique maximal atlas A', such that A cA'. (A' is the set of all  charts I such that, for every g E A, I· g-I and g . r1 are differentiable  to the required order on g(dom I ndom g) and on I(dom I ndom g),  respectively.) The charts of A' induce neighbourhood relations be­ tween the points of M: if P and Q belong to the domain of a chart  I E A' which maps them onto neighbouring points of Rn, we regard P  and Q as neighbouring points of M; if P and Q do not belong to the  domain of the same chart of A', we may look for a point R which  belongs with P to the domain of a chart II and with Q to the domain  of a chart h. and establish neighbourhood relations between P and Q  through the mediation of R. (For a more exact formulation of these  ideas, see Appendix, p.362.) In the second place, an abstract set M  which is given the structure of an n-dimensional manifold by its  association with an atlas A, can be given the structure of an m­ dimensional manifold (m #-n) by its association with a different atlas  B.26 A given atlas, however, unambiguously fixes the dimension  number of the manifold. This is due to the following fact: il m #-n,  there cannot be an injective, continuous and open mapping 01 an open  subset 01 R n onto an open subset 01 R m; consequently, if the charts of  an atlas fulfil condition (ii) stated above, their ranges must be open  subsets of R n for a single positive integral value of n. The statement </p><div id="pagenum"><p>in italics was not proved until this century (Brouwer, 1911b). But </p></div><div id="pagenum"><p>88 CHAPTER 2 </p></div><p id="page">Riemann apparently took it for granted. In fact, it seems intuitively  obvious. Faith in this sort of intuition was badly shaken however when  Cantor (1878) proved that R 2 can be mapped injectively -though not  continuously -into Rand Peano (1890) proved that R can be mapped  continuously -though not injectively -onto R 2.  2.2.7 The Tangent Space  Smooth curves and surfaces in space can easily be conceived as one­ and two-dimensional differentiable manifolds. Indeed, Gauss'  methods for dealing with them are historically at the root of the very  notion of a differentiable manifold. This notion enables us to transfer  analogically the familiar concepts of the theory of surfaces to any set  of arbitrary entities which has been associated with an atlas. This  momentous step is nowhere elaborated upon by Riemann but is  implicit in his lecture. Without spending time on definitions or  conceptual analyses, he proceeds in Part II to sketch a full-fledged  generalization to n-dimensional differentiable manifolds of Gauss'  intrinsic geometry of surfaces. Clarity with respect to Riemann's  assumptions was arrived at much later. Yet we cannot avoid making  use of some of the later developments, even at the risk of its  appearing anachronistic.  If P is any point of a smooth surface S, S touches at P a plane Sp,  the tangent plane at P. We saw above that a consideration of tangent  planes played a major role in the establishment of Gauss' theory of  surfaces - a remarkable fact indeed, since the notion of a tangent  plane, which lies for the most part in the space outside the surface,  seems quite foreign to the project of studying the intrinsic properties  of surfaces. We shall now provide each point P of an n-dimensional  differentiable manifold M with the analogue of a tangent plane, namely  an n-dimensional vector space T p(M), called the tangent space at P.  T p(M) must be conceived rather abstractly, for we take M to be an  arbitrary manifold. No thought of a space surrounding M should enter  into the definition of T p(M). Since any smooth surlace S may be treated  as a two-dimensional manifold, each point P on S will have a  two-dimensional vector space T peS) attached to it. T peS) is naturally  isomorphic with the tangent plane Sp (p.72). Consequently, it can fill the  latter's role in the theory of surfaces. In other words, we can identify Sp </p><div id="pagenum"><p>with Tp(S) or, as I prefer to say, we can substitute the latter for the </p></div><div id="pagenum"><p>NON-EUCLIDEAN GEOMETRIES 89 </p></div><p id="page">former. But T p(S) belongs to S intrinsically, since we shall have defined  it without making any reference to how S lies in space.  We shall outline the construction of the tangent space T p(M) at a  point P of an n-dimensional manifold M. But we shall first show that  the very nature of differentiable manifolds enables us to extend to  them the notion of differentiability. If rp maps an m-dimensional  manifold M into an m'-dimensional manifold M', we say that rp is  differentiable at P E M if, given a chart x defined at P and a chart y  defined at rp(P), the mapping f = y • rp • X-I possesses all partial  derivatives of every order at x(p). This definition makes good sense  because f maps an open set of Rm into Rm'. The differentiability of rp  does not depend on the choice of charts x, y, because all coordinate  transformations of M and M' are differentiable. Rft is made into a  manifold by associating with it an atlas whose sole chart is the  identity mapping a~a. We stipulate that Rft (for every positive  integer n) possesses this manifold structure. We can now define a  path in a manifold M as a differentiable mapping of an open interval  of R into M.27 Let ~p(M) be the set of all paths c which are defined on  some open interval about zero and are such that c(O) = P. Let 81p(M)  be the set of all differentiable functions that map some neighbourhood  of Pinto R. If c E ~p(M) and f E 81p(M), f· c maps an interval of R  into R. The derivative d(f . c)/dt is defined at zero; its value there will  be denoted by d(f· c)/dtl o. We assign to each c E ~p(M) a function  cp: 81p(M) -+ R defined as follows:  cp(f) = d(f . c )/dtl o• (1)  The set of these functions cp is endowed with a standard linear  structure (Appendix, p.364). With that structure it is called the tangent  space of M at P and denoted by T p(M). Moreover, if c is any path  such that c(u) = P for some real number u, we assign to c a unique  vector cp E T p(M) according to the following rule. Let Tu denote the  translation R -+ R; x~x + u. Let l' = c . Tu' Then, l' E ~p(M) and 'Yp is  defined by (1). We set  (2)  If K is the range of c, K is a submanifold of M and the canonical  injection i: K -+ M; a~a is an imbedding. It can be shown that cp </p><div id="pagenum"><p>spans T p(K), the one-dimensional tangent space of K at P. The union </p></div><div id="pagenum"><p>90 CHAPTER 2 </p></div><p id="page">of the tangent spaces of an n-dimensional manifold M can be given  the structure of a 2n-dimensional manifold, the tangent bundle TM. It  is thus possible to define differentiable mappings of Minto TM and  vice versa.28  2.2.8 Riemannian Manifolds, Metrics and Curvature  The second item of Riemann's programme is concerned with metric  relations in n-dimensional manifolds and the simplest conditions  under which they can be determined. Metric relations (Maassver­ hiiltnisse) are what enable quantitative comparisons between the  parts of a "manifold" (in Riemann's sense of the word). Riemann  observes that the parts of a discrete "manifold" can be quantitatively  compared by counting, but if the "manifold" is continuous -as all  manifolds in the special sense defined above are -quantitative  comparison can be made only by measurement. "Measurement", says  Riemann, "consists in a superposition of the quantities to be  compared. Therefore it requires a means of transporting one quantity  to be used as a standard (Maassstab) for the others. Otherwise one  can compare two quantities only if one is a part of the other, and then  only as to more or less, not as to how much.,,29 This passage, which  turns all of a sudden from the lofty musings of ontological and  mathematical abstraction to down-to-earth tasks reminiscent of  tailoring and bartending, has weighed heavily on the minds of  philosophers of geometry for over a century. It is all the more  remarkable, since measurement in the physical sciences is rarely  effected by the superposition of a standard upon the object to be  measured, either because the latter is too small or too large, or  because it lies· too far away, or even because superposition is repug­ nant to its very nature.30 I do not see very well how one can transport  (forttragen) a part of a manifold while the rest of it remains unmoved.  But this is a question we need not discuss now (cf. pp.159f., 174£,).  Our present interest in the above passage stems from its connection  with Riemann's investigations of Part II. His aim there is to determine  the conditions under which measurements can be performed on a  manifold. To this end, he instinctively translates the passage's  obscure operational prescription -free mobility of the standard of  measurement inside the manifold -into a neat mathematical require­ ment, which is that magnitudes be independent of their position in the </p><div id="pagenum"><p>manifold (Unabhiingigkeit der Grossen vom Ort). This requirement, </p></div><div id="pagenum"><p>NON-EUCLIDEAN GEOMETRIES 91 </p></div><p id="page">he says, can be satisfied in several ways. The first that comes to mind  consists in supposing that the length of a line is independent of the  way how the line lies in the manifold (Unabhiingigkeit von der Lage),  so that every line can be measured by every other line. If this obtains,  the length of an arc in a manifold will be determinable as an intrinsic  property, i.e. as a property belonging to the arc as a one-dimensional  submanifold, no matter what its relation to the points outside it.3!  The length of an arc in Euclidean space was traditionally conceived  as the limit of a sequence of lengths of polygonal lines inscribed in  the arc. This conception is extended quite naturally to Rn, where  'straight' segments are easily discerned.32 The length of the straight  segment joining a = (at. ... , an) to b = (bt. ... ,bn) is defined, by an  immediate generalization of the theorem of Pythagoras, as la -bl =  I(~;=! (ai -bi)2)!121. This method of definition is not intrinsic in the  above sense, and is not generally applicable to arcs in an arbitrary  n-dimensional manifold, since one cannot know beforehand whether  anything like a polygonal line will even exist in such a manifold. The  traditional definition of arc length can be given however a different  reading in the light of the concept of a tangent space developed in the  foregoing section. As we saw on page 69, the length of a path c was  given classically by an integral which we may note, for brevity, as f f . c(t)dt. The 'element of length', f· c(t), was interpreted as the  length of an arbitrarily short straight line tangent to the path at c(t).  This notion is somewhat mysterious, for the length of an arbitrarily  short line is not a definite number at all (unless we simply equate it to  zero). The obscurity is avoided, however, if we conceive f as a  function which assigns to each point c(t) the 'length' of the tangent  vector cc(t) defined in eqn. (2) of Section 2.2.7. This will make sense  only if that vector has been given a 'length'. This is usually done by  defining a 'norm' on the vector space to which it belongs.33 Since the  concepts of tangent vector and tangent space are intrinsic, the rein­ terpreted definition of arc length satisfies Riemann's requirement and  can be extended to an arbitrary manifold. We shall now see how this  is done.  Let M be an n-dimensional differentiable manifold. To each point  P E M there is attached an n-dimensional vector space, the tangent  space Tp(M). Consider any smooth arc in M.34 We may regard it as the  range of an injective path c. At a point P E c(t), a definite element of </p><div id="pagenum"><p>T p(M) is associated with path c, namely Cpo If, in every tangent space </p></div><div id="pagenum"><p>92 CHAPTER 2 </p></div><p id="page">of M, there is a norm, each vector cp possesses a definite length Ilcpll  which we may regard as an index, so to speak, of the lengthening that  our arc experiences as it passes through P. The length of the arc c([a,  b]) is then given by the integral  b f 11(\(1)11 dt. (1)  This definition is indeed intrinsic, for CC(I) spans the tangent space  TC(I)c«a, b ».35 Since we are dealing with an arbitrary manifold M, the  norm in its tangent spaces must be conceived quite broadly. It need  not even be defined in all of them in the same way. It is required only  that the norm of T p(M) does not change abruptly as P ranges over M.  This demand leaves enormous latitude of choice. Riemann imposes  two further restrictions. The first is that the norm in each tangent  space must be a positive homogeneous function of the first degree;  i.e. that for any vector v and any real number a, lIavll = lalllvll. This  requirement agrees well with our intuitive idea of length and is  ordinarily included in the general definition of a norm on vector  spaces. It ensures that the length of the arc c([ a, b]) will not depend  on the choice of its parametrical representation c. Riemann's second  restriction sounds less natural. It amounts to demanding that the  manifold M be what we now call a Riemannian manifold. Riemann is  well aware that this is not really necessary for a reasonable solution  of his problem. He observes, however, that the discussion of a more  general case would involve no essentially different principles, but  would be rather time-consuming and throw comparatively little new  light on the study of space. (Riemann, H, p.14).  Let us say what we mean by a Riemannian manifold. A given  vector space V determines a vector space fJ2(V) of bilinear functions  on V x V. Let fJ2(M) denote the union of the spaces fJ2(T p(M»  determined by each tangent space Tp(M) of a manifold M . .o/"2(M) is  endowed with a standard differentiable structure (compare p.366). It  therefore makes sense to speak of a differentiable mapping of Minto  fJ2(M). A Riemannian manifold or R-manifold is a pair (M, JL) where  M is a differentiable manifold and JL is a differentiable mapping of M  into fJ2(M) which assigns to each P E M a bilinear function JLp: </p><div id="pagenum"><p>T p(M) x T p(M)~ R, and fulfils the following three conditions: </p></div><div id="pagenum"><p>NON-EUCLIDEAN GEOMETRIES 93 </p></div><p id="page">(i) JL is symmetric, i.e_ for every P E M, and every v, wET p(M) ,  JLp(v, w) = JLp(w, v);  (ii) JL is non-degenerate, i.e. for every P E M, if vET p(M), JLp( v,  w) = 0 for every wE Tp(M) if and only if v = 0;  (iii) JL is positive definite, i.e. for every P E M, and every vET p(M),  JLp( v, v);;;,: 0, equality obtaining if and only if v = o.  (iii) clearly implies (ii); (ii), in its turn, implies that for every P E M,  if (ed is a basis of T p(M), the matrix [JLp(ej, ej)] is non-singular (i.e. its  determinant is not equal to zero).  If (M, JL) is an R-manifold, JL is called an R-metric on M. If JL fulfils  (i) and (ii), but JLp(v, v) takes values less than, equal to or greater than  o (depending on the argument v), we say that JL is an indefinite metric  on M. A pair (M, JL), where M is a differentiable manifold and JL is  either an R-metric or an indefinite metric on M, is called a semi­ Riemannian manifold. The study of semi-Riemannian manifolds has  become important due to their use in the theory of relativity. Riemann  concerned himself exclusively with R-manifolds. An R-manifold  structure can be defined on a wide variety of differentiable manifolds.  If JL is an R-metric on a manifold M and P is any point of M,  v~I(JLp( v, v» 1121 is a norm in T p(M). If we substitute this norm in  expression (1) we obtain the standard definition of arc length on  R-manifolds. An R-manifold M is made into a metric space, in the  usual sense,36 if a distance function d: M x M -+ R is defined as  follows: If P, Q EM, we let L(P, Q) denote the set of real numbers  {AlA is the length of an arc in M, joining P and Q}; then d(P, Q) = inf  L(P, Q). In other words, the distance between two points P, Q of an  R-manifold M is the infimum or greatest lower bound of the  lengths of the arcs joining P to Q. This is the standard metric  structure of R-manifolds. Since it is ultimately determined by the  mapping JL that characterizes each such manifold, JL is customarily  called the metric of the manifold. (This terminology has given rise to  some philosophical misunderstandings due to the fact that indefinite  metrics do not make their respective semi-Riemannian manifolds into  metric spaces.)  Consider an n-dimensional manifold M, endowed with an R-metric  JL. Let U C M be the domain of a chart x. x maps an arbitrary point  P E U on the real number n-tuple (xi(P), ... ,x"(P». For each coor­ dinate function Xi there is a unique path ci through P, defined on </p><div id="pagenum"><p>some open neighbourhood of 0, such that if Q E U and Q = ci(t) for </p></div><div id="pagenum"><p>94 CHAPTER 2 </p></div><p id="page">some real number t in the domain of ci, then the i-th coordinate of Q,  that is, Xi(Q), equals xi(P) + t, while all the remaining coordinates of  Q are equal to the respective coordinates of P. (In other words, all  coordinate functions except Xi are constant on the image of ci.) The  tangent vector t~ is denoted by a/axilp. The set of vectors (a/axilp)  (1:S;; i:s;; n) is a basis of Tp(M).37 We define a set of n2 functions gij on  U:  gij(P) = J.Lp (a~.lp -bIJ (1 :s;; i, j :s;; n). (2)  These functions can be shown to be differentiable, as they are  composed of differentiable mappings.38 Let g be the determinant of  the matrix [gij] and let Gij be the cofactor of gij in this matrix. Since J.L  is non-degenerate, g~ O. A second set of n2 differentiable functions glj  is defined on U by  (3)  Clearly  n  ~ gu,gij = 8i (i.e. 1 if j = k or 0 if j;t. k).  .=1 (4)  Since J.L is symmetric, gij = gjl and gii = gii, so that each set comprises  at most n(n + 1)/2 different functions. We define two further sets of  functions on U, for use later: 39  [ .. k] = ! (agu: + agi~ _ ~)  IJ, 2 ax} ax' axk'  {~.} = i ghkIij, k].  I J k=1 (1 :s;; i, j, k, h :s;; n) (5)  We shall now express arc length in U by means of the functions gjj.  Consider any smooth arc in U.

The metric JL can therefore  be expressed on U as }:i.igii dxi®dxi(l":; i,j":; n).41 In particular, the  standard metric of Euclidean space can be expressed in terms of  any Cartesian mapping x as dx'®dx'+dx2®dx2+dx3®dx3. By  analogy, any n-dimensional R-manifold whose metric can be put into  the form }:~=I dxi ®dxi relatively to some global chart x is called an  n-dimensional Euclidean space (e.g. R" with its standard metric).  Let U be, as above, the domain of chart x in R-manifold M. A path  'Y on U. parametrized by arc length t, is a geodesic if it is  a solution of the differential equations: 42  d2xi• 'Y ~" {j} dxi .

It can be proved that if P E U, there  is an open neighbourhood of P, V C U, such that every point Q E V is  joined to P by a geodetic arc, which is the shortest arc joining P and  Q. In V, each geodesic l' such that 1'(0) = P is fully determined if we  are given 'YP. Consider the mapping Expp: 'Y~y(1) defined on the set  of vectors {i'pl1'(O) = Pl. It can be proved that Expp maps a neigh­ bourhood of 0 in T p(M) diffeomorphically onto a neighbourhood of P  contained in V.43 We shall see that an essential step in Riemann's  investigations rests on these results, which he, with his incredible flair  for mathematical truth, assumed without proof.  We have seen that the integrand of (1) can on the domain of each  chart of an R-manifold be equated to the square root of a chart­ related quadratic expression (6). Riemann rightly maintains that the  value of this expression does not depend on the choice of the chart,  being (as we shall say) invariant under coordinate transformations. </p><div id="pagenum"><p>This observation appears trivial indeed if the matter is approached in </p></div><div id="pagenum"><p>96 CHAPTER 2 </p></div><p id="page">the above manner. We shall call the integrand of (1) the line element  of the manifold. The quadratic form taken by the line element on the  manifolds given his name is used by Riemann to characterize them.  He is well aware that they are just a special kind of manifold, what he  calls the "simplest cases". The "next simple case", he says, would  consist of manifolds whose line element can be expressed as the  fourth root of an expression of fourth degree. "Investigation of this  more general class", he adds, "would indeed involve essentially the  same principles, but would be rather time consuming and would  throw comparatively little new light on the study of space. ,,44 That is  why he restricts his research to what we call R-manifolds. He  observes that the chart-related expression of the line element depends  on n(n + 1)/2 arbitrary functions (gij) , whereas coordinate trans­ formations are given by n equations. There remain therefore n(n- 1)/2 functional relations which do not depend on the choice of chart  but must be characteristic of the manifold. They should suffice to  determine metrical relations on an n-dimensional R-manifold M. In  his lecture, Riemann approaches this question locally, showing how to  find n(n -1)/2 quantities at an arbitrary point P E M which, according  to him, determine metrical relations in a neighbourhood of P. But  before setting out to show this, he makes an important philosophical  point. The line element on M takes at each point P E M the Euclidean  form (l:~=1 (dxi(P)0dxi(P»(cp, Cp»1f2, for a suitable chart x defined on  all M, if and only if the functions gij determined by x satisfy  (10)  This presupposes a very special choice of the n(n -1)/2 arbitrary  conditions that according to Riemann govern metrical relations on M.  Consequently, the concept of Euclidean space is very far from being  coextensive with that of a three-dimensional R-manifold, and far less  with that of a three-dimensional manifold iiberhaupt. Just as Riemann  had announced at the beginning of his lecture, the general notion of a  threefold extended quantity does not, in any way, prescribe a Eucli­ dean character to space.  Let P be any point in an R-manifold M. In order to find the  n(n -1)/2 quantities which suppos~dly determine metrical relations  near P, Riemann chooses a very particular chart at P. Let Expp map a  neighbourhood of 0 E T p(M) diffeomorphically onto a neighbourhood </p><div id="pagenum"><p>W of P. Choose a basis (Yi) on Tp(M) such that /Lp(Y i, Yj) = 8j(1 ~ i, </p></div><div id="pagenum"><p>NON-EUCLIDEAN GEOMETRIES 97 </p></div><p id="page">j os;; n), that is, a so-called orthonormal basis. Let k: T p(M) -+ R n be  given by k(l:~;t aiYi) = (at. ... , an). The chart chosen by Riemann is  defined on W as  (11)  We call it a Riemannian normal chart. It can be shown that in terms  of it  agrl ~ p=O, (0 os;; i, j, k os;; n). (12)  This has an important implication that fully justifies the choice of the  peculiar chart. Consider the Taylor expansion of the gij about P:  _ '5' agr I k 1 ~ a2gr I k h 2 gij -gij(P) + '7' ~ p x + 2 it axka~h p x x + o(lxl ), (13)  where o(lxl2) denotes a function f: M~R such that  . f(Q)_  ~lx(QW-O. (14)  Since the first derivatives of the gij vanish at P, the deviation of the gij  from the Euclidean value they attain at P is measured, in a suitable  neighbourhood of P, by the third term of the above expansion. Let us  write  2 .  l~l-c (l,.::::··kh ) 2 a?axh p - ij,kh ~ I, }, , os;; n . (15)  The Taylor expansion of the squared norm in tangent spaces near P  can now be expressed in terms of our Riemannian normal chart:  = L dxi dxi + L C;j,khXkXh dxi dxj + o(lxl)  i i,j,k,h  =a\+a 2+o, (16)  This means that, if v is a sufficiently small vector at a point Q near P,  ~ Cij,kh Xk (Q)xh (Q) dx6(v) dxb(v) (summation implied over all four in­ dices) is the correction that must be added to the Euclidean value  ~ dxb(v) dx6(v) to obtain the squared length of v, Since P is arbitrary,  M can be covered by a collection of Riemannian normal charts, Thus, </p><div id="pagenum"><p>it appears that the key to metrical relations on M could be found </p></div><div id="pagenum"><p>98 CHAPTER 2 </p></div><p id="page">through the study of the second term a2 of expansion (16). Riemann  does not write the latter out as we do, but simply states that it is given  by a quadratic expression in the (Xi dxi -xi dxi)(1 .,. i, j .,. n). This  implies that there exist numbers Rii,kh such that  (17)  Riemann conceives the differentials dxi as infinitesimals, i.e. as the  coordinates of a point P' 'infinitely near' P. The Xi are, of course, the  coordinates of an arbitrary point Q in W. Viewed in this way, a2 is an  infinitesimal quantity of the fourth order, which, Riemann says, when  divided by the area A of the infinitesimal geodetic triangle PQP',  equals a finite quantity a2/ A. Riemann claims that this quantity,  mUltiplied by -3/4, equals the G-curvature at P of the two-dimen­ sional submanifold of M on which the triangle PQP' lies. This implies  that a2/A does not depend on the chart X and has exactly the same  value for every two points P', Q in Wwhich are such that the geodetic  arcs joining them to P lie on the same two-dimensional sub manifold  of M. Riemann adds:  We found that n(n -1)/2 functions of position were necessary for determining the  metric relations of an [n-dimensional R-manifold]; hence, if the [O-curvature] is given  in n(n -1)/2 surface directions at each point, the metric relations of the manifold can  be determined, provided only that there are no identities among these values, and  indeed this does not, in general, occur. The metric relations of these manifolds, in  which the line element can be represented as the square root of a differential  expression of the second degree, can thus be expressed in a way completely in­ dependent of the choice of coordinates.4s  We cannot stop here to prove or disprove these portentous claims,  but a few more observations might help to clarify them. The  obscurest point lies perhaps in the treatment of the dxi as  infinitesimals. This is readily justified in the context of formal  differential geometry (see Note 8, ad jinem), but I shall abide by the  now standard approach to the subject and view them as covector  fields defined on a neighbourhood of p.46 Since we consider only their  value at P we write dxi for dX~.47 We define a quadratic function </p><div id="pagenum"><p>F: T p(M) x T p(M) ~ R by giving its value at an arbitrary pair (X, Y) of </p></div><div id="pagenum"><p>NON-EUCLIDEAN GEOMETRIES 99 </p></div><p id="page">vectors in T p(M):  F(X, Y) = i~1t Cii,klt dxi(X) dxi(X) dxk(y) dx"(Y). (18)  It can be shown that the numbers Cii,klt, defined in (15), fulfil the  conditions48  Cii,kIt = CkIt,ii'  Cii,kIt + CiIt,ik + Cik,lti = 0, (l"'i,j,k,h"'n). (19)  It is then purely a matter of tedious calculation to show that F can be  expressed in terms of the forms (dxi A dxi) as follows:  1 ~ . k . It F(X, Y) ="3.. Cji,kIt(dx' A dx )(dxl "dx leX, V).  ',I. It (20)  If X and Y span a two-dimensional subspace a in T p(M), we can  assign to a a number k(a), invariant under coordinate trans­ formations and independent of the choice of the generators X and y:49  k(a) = - 3F(X, Y) 2'  p.p(X, X)p.p(Y, Y) -(p.p(X, Y» (21)  Riemann's claims can now be stated as follows: If n = 2, so that  a = Tp(M), k(a) is the G-curvature of M at P. If n > 2 and {3 is a  neighbourhood of 0 in a, such that Expp is a diffeomorphism on (3,  k(a) is the G-curvature at P of the two-dimensional submanifold  M' = Expp({3) (regarded as an R-manifold with metric p. • i, where JL is  the R-metric on M and i: M' ~ M is the canonical injection.) M'  coincides on a neighbourhood of P with the locus of all geodesics  through P whose tangent vector at P belongs to a. Let (Y h ••• , Y n) be  a basis of T p(M); then there are n (n -1)/2 two-dimensional subspaces  aij. spanned by the vector pairs (Yi• Yi) (I ... i < j ... n). Riemann's  chief claim in the passage quoted is that metrical relations on M are  fully determined if we are given the values k(aii) for everyone of  these subspaces aii at each point P E M.50  Riemann pays special attention to two kinds of manifolds. A  manifold M belongs to the first of them when at every point P E M,  k(a) = 0 for every two-dimensional subspace aCT p(M). There can  then be defined on a neighbourhood of each P E M a chart x such that,  on its domain, p.(a/axi, a/axil equals 1 if i = j and equals 0 otherwise </p><div id="pagenum"><p>(I ... i, j ... n). The domain of x can evidently be mapped isometrically </p></div><div id="pagenum"><p>100 CHAPTER 2 </p></div><p id="page">into Rft (with its standard metric; see p.95). M is what Riemann calls  a flat manifold. The second kind of manifolds considered by Riemann  includes fiat manifolds as a subclass. He calls them manifolds of  constant curvature. If M is such a manifold k(a) equals the same real  number for every two-dimensional subspace acT p(M) at every point  P E M. Schur (1886b) subsequently proved that M is a manifold of  constant curvature if the preceding condition is fulfilled at any point  P E M. In Part 111.1, Riemann observes that only if space is a  manifold of constant curvature one may maintain that "the existence  of bodies", and not just that of widthless lines, does not depend on  how they lie in space. In other words, only if space has a constant  curvature does it make sense to speak of rigid bodies. We shall see in  Sections 3.1.1-3.1.3 that Helmholtz regarded the existence of rigid  bodies as a conditio sine qua non for the measurement of distance in  physical space. If he is right, then physical geometry must rest on the  assumption that space is a manifold of constant curvature. This  restricts the spectrum of viable physical geometries considerably.  Helmholtz' 'problem of space' consists of determining that spec­ trum, under his just-mentioned assumption, by purely mathematical  means. In order to solve this problem one must give a clear mathe­ matical formulation to the idea that the existence of bodies is in­ dependent of how they lie in space. This can reasonably be under­ stood to mean that any geometrical body placed in an arbitrary  position can be copied isometrically about any point and in any  direction. Now, one can only speak of isometrical copying with  regard to a manifold in which metrical relations are determined. If, as  Riemann contends, the latter depend wholly on the values of k(see  however, Note 50), the required copies can certainly be made in a  manifold of constant curvature, for metrical relations in such a  manifold are "exactly the same in all the directions around anyone  point, as in the directions around any other, and thus the same  constructions can be effected starting from either".51 On the other  hand, if P is a point of a manifold M and a and a' are two-dimen­ sional subspaces of the tangent space T p(M) such that k(a) -:I-k(a'),  let (3 and (3' be the neighbourhoods of 0 in a and a', respec­ tively, which are diffeomorphically mapped into M by Expp. Expp«(3)  is then a two-dimensional sub manifold of M whose tangent space at P  is a. But it is impossible to construct an isometrical copy of Expp«(3) </p><div id="pagenum"><p>with tangent space a' at P. This can be seen as follows: Expp«(3) is </p></div><div id="pagenum"><p>NON-EUCLIDEAN GEOMETRIES 101 </p></div><p id="page">covered by all geodesics through P whose tangent vector belongs to  a. The isometric copy of a geodesic is a geodesic. But all geodesics  through P with tangent vector in a' lie on Expp(!:J'). Hence an  isometric copy of Expp(!:J) can have a' for its tangent space at P only  if it coincides with Expp(!:J') on a neighbourhood of P. This however  is impossible, since Expp(!:J) and Expp(!:J') are surfaces whose G­ curvatures differ at P. We may conclude, therefore, that unless M is a  manifold of constant curvature not even surfaces -let alone bodies­ are independent of how they lie in space. Riemann gives a general  formula for the line element of a manifold of constant curvature K:  1 ./~·· ds = K .. "LJ dx' dx'.  1+4 L x'x' (22)  Riemann illustrates these ideas in a brief discussion of surfaces of  constant curvature. If the curvature is K > 0, the surface can be  mapped isometrically into a sphere of radius l/YK. If K = 0, it can be  mapped isometrically into a Euclidean plane.  In his cursory reference to surfaces of constant curvature K < 0,  Riemann does not mention the fact that they can be mapped  isometrically into a BL plane, but I am convinced that he was aware  of it. Mter all, BL-space geometry was at that time the only known  example of a three-dimensional manifold with a non-Euclidean  metric, and it is more than likely that concern with its viability and  significance -which surely was not lacking in Gauss' entourage­ prompted Riemann's own revolutionary approach to the question.  His entire exposition is designed to bring out the fact that Euclidean  manifolds, i.e. manifolds of constant zero curvature, constitute only a  very peculiar species of a vast genus.52  *Riemann extended the Gaussian concept of curvature to an arbi­ trary n-dimensional R-manifold M by using what we may call  sectional curvatures, i.e. the G-curvatures of two-dimensional sub­ manifolds of M. The value of these sectional curvatures at a point  P E M is given by the function F defined on T p(M) x T p(M), (20). We  would possess a general conception of the curvature of M if we could  determine, once and for all, the F function attached to each point of  M. This job is performed by the celebrated Riemann tensor (in its  covariant form). Riemann himself went a long way towards its </p><div id="pagenum"><p>definition in his prize-essay of 1861.53 His work was completed by </p></div><div id="pagenum"><p>102 CHAPTER 2 </p></div><p id="page">Christoffel (1869), who gave a definition of the tensor in terms of its  components in an arbitrary chart. That the tensor had, so to speak,  geometric substance, and was not an ephemeral chart-dependent  appearance, was proved in classical mathematics by showing that in a  coordinate transformation the components transform according to  fixed rules.  * A deeper insight into the geometric meaning of curvature was  gained through Levi-Civita's work on parallel transport (1917). As  explained subsequently by Weyl a differentiable manifold M can be  endowed with an affine structure, which determines, for each point  P E M and each path k through P, a linear bijection of the tangent  space T p(M) onto each tangent space attached to a point on the range  of k. If Q is such a point, we denote by T~ the mapping of T p(M) onto  T Q(M) determined, for path k, by the affine structure of M. The  mappings T fulfil the following requirements: Ttp is the inverse of T~;  also, if k, P and v E Tp(M) are fixed, T~X(V) describes a smooth curve  in the tangent bundle TM as X varies over the range of k. We may  therefore view the vector v as being carried 'parallel to itself' along  the range of k, from P to Q, as X goes from the former point to the  latter. T~ v) is said to be the image of v by parallel transport from P  to Q, along the path k; v and t ~Q( v) are parallel vectors relative to k.  Two vectors belonging, respectively, to Tp(M) and T<i:M) which are  parallel relative to k are not generally parallel relative to a different  path k' joining P and Q. An affine structure A on M determines a  collection of paths called the (affine) geodesics of (M, A). They can be  characterized as follows: if k is a geodesic through P and Q in M and  v is a vector tangent to k at P, then T~( v) is a vector tangent to k at  Q. In other words, all vectors tangent to a geodesic are parallel  relative to it. If p. is an R-metric on M, there is a unique affine  structure AIL such that the affine geodesics of (M, AIL) are the metric  geodesics of (M, p.), i.e. the paths which satisfy equations (9). This  means that if an arc K, joining P and Q, is the range of a geodesic of  (M, AIL)' K is an extremal, i.e. K is either longer or shorter than all  other nearby arcs joining P and Q. Suppose now that M is endowed  with a metric IJ-and that the affine structure AIL defines the mappings  T described above. Let c: [a, b]~M be a path such that c(a)=  c(b) = P. Denote the mapping by parallel transport of Tc(a)(M) onto  T c(b)(M) by T~p. Then, for every non-zero vector vET p(M), T~p( v) will </p><div id="pagenum"><p>normally differ from v. If the range of c is a small closed circuit, the </p></div><div id="pagenum"><p>NON-EUCLIDEAN GEOMETRIES 103 </p></div><p id="page">said difference is measured by the components of the Riemann  tensor.  *In the Appendix, the affine structure of a manifold is introduced by  means of Koszul's concept of a linear connection. This provides also  a straightforward definition of the Riemann tensor. Let M be an  R-manifold with metric I-' and let V be the linear connection which  determines the unique affine structure Ap.o For any vector fields X, Y,  Z, Won M, let  R«X, Y),Z) = Vx(VyZ) -Vy(VxZ) -V1x.yjZ  R(X, Y, Z, W) = I-'(R«Z, W), V), X) (23)  The mapping (X, Y, Z, ~R(X, Y, Z, W) is a covariant tensor field  of order 4. We call it the covariant Riemann curvature tensor.54 The  name is justified because, if P E M and F is the quadratic function  defined in (18)  (24)  (where Rp , Xp and Yp denote, respectively, the values of R, X and Y  at P). Since V is determined by 1-', (23) and (24) imply that metric  determines curvature, i.e. that the generalized version of Gauss'  theorema egregium holds in every R-manifold. (Concerning Rie­ mann's claim that, conversely, curvature determines metric, see Note  50.)  2.2.9 Riemann's Speculations about Physical Space  Part III of Riemann's lecture concerns the 'application' of the forego­ ing to space. It rests on the assumption that space is an extended  quantity and, consequently, a "manifold", i.e. the set of  "specifications" (Bestimmungsweisen) of a genus (allgemeiner  Begriff). Since space is probably a continuous "manifold" -or, at any  rate, is generally treated as if it were one -its elements are called  "points" (p.85). Indeed, Riemann's choice of the word "point" to  designate the elements of a continuous "manifold" is doubtless  motivated by the ordinary use of the word when speaking of space.  Riemann therefore openly treats space as the (structured) aggregate  of its points. For a mathematician, this view is reasonable enough,  since every proposition belonging to a geometric theory can be  formulated as a statement concerning the structured set of points </p><div id="pagenum"><p>postulated by the theory. The view should also satisfy a physicist, for </p></div><div id="pagenum"><p>104 CHAPTER 2 </p></div><p id="page">'space' can only be to him the structured point-set where bodies or  their theoretical representations are located by the mathematical  theory he is working with, or -if you prefer a metaphysical manner of  speech -that entity, whatever it may be, which the said point-set is  supposed to represent. Even if the representation of such an entity  by any particular theory is admittedly inadequate, the general  description of space as a structured point-set should not be ob­ jectionable to the physicist, since a better representation can only  consist -as long as physics is mathematical and mathematics is not  expelled from Cantor's paradise -in a differently structured point­ set.  According to Riemann, all we can say about space without resort­ ing to experience is that it is one among many possible kinds of  "manifold". It may even be a discrete "manifold". However, Rie­ mann considers at length only a smaller range of alternatives, namely,  finite-dimensional extended quantities, i.e. finite-dimensional  differentiable manifolds. This tentative limitation of admissible  alternatives, like the further restriction to R-manifolds, is clearly  founded, to Riemann's mind, upon an empirical consideration, viz. the  success of Euclidean geometry within "the limits of observation".  Riemann distinguishes between two kinds of properties of manifolds:  "extensive or regional relations" (Ausdehnungs- oder Gebietsver­ hiiltnisse) and "metric relations" (Maassverhiiltnisse). We have al­ ready spoken about the latter. The former I take to be the relations  determined by the differentiable structure of the manifold. They in­ clude the topology of the manifold and all so-called topological  properties (i.e. properties preserved by homeomorphisms), but that is  not all what they include. Riemann points out an important difference  between these two kinds of properties: while the variety of "ex­ tensive relations" is discrete, that of "metric relations" is continuous.  Consequently, empirical statements concerning the former, though  hypothetical, are apt to be exact. Thus, we usually assume that space  has three dimensions and, if this turns out to be wrong, space will  have four, five or another integral number of dimensions. By contrast,  empirically verifiable hypotheses concerning the metric relations of  space are necessarily imprecise, and they can hold only within a  certain range of experimental error. Thus, the statement that space is  Euclidean, that is, that its curvature is everywhere exactly zero, is not </p><div id="pagenum"><p>admissible as a scientific conjecture: we can hypothesize at best that </p></div><div id="pagenum"><p>NON-EUCLIDEAN GEOMETRIES 105 </p></div><p id="page">the curvature of space lies within the interval (-E, E), for some real  number E > O. This conclusion, unstated by Riemann but clearly  implied by his remarks, has considerable importance, for the  geometry of a manifold is non-Euclidean -either spherical or BL­ once its constant curvature deviates ever so slightly from zero. If  hypotheses concerning space curvature can only assign it intervals,  not fixed values, even the supposition that space curvature must be  constant appears to be ruled out. If there is no empirical means of  telling which value, within a given interval, space curvature does, in  fact, take on, the latter may just as well vary gradually within that  interval from place to place or from time to time. Towards the end of  his lecture, Riemann advances an even bolder conjecture, namely,  that space curvature may vary quite wildly within very small dis­ tances, provided the total curvature over intervals of a suitable size is  approximately zero. The celebrated hypothesis on the "space-theory  of matter" put forward by W.K. Clifford (1845-1879) in 1870 is little  more than a restatement of this conjecture of Riemann's. Clifford  wrote:  I hold in fact  (1) That small portions of space are in fact of a nature analogous to little hills on a  surface which is on the average fiat; namely, that the ordinary laws of geometry are not  valid in them.  (2) That this property of being curved or distorted is continually being passed on  from one portion of space to another after the manner of a wave.  (3) That this variation of the curvature of space is what really happens in the  phenomenon which we call the motion of matter, whether ponderable or etherial.  (4) That in the physical world nothing else takes place but this variation, subject  (possibly) to the law of continuity.55  These conjectures concerning the microphysical variability of space  curvature are often said to anticipate the conception, propounded in  Einstein's theory of gravitation, of a four-dimensional space-tirrze  manifold, whose curvature changes from point to point at the macro­ physical level.  Another remark by Riemann does unquestionably anticipate  Einstein. He notes that a manifold may -indeed, must -be unlimited  (unbegrenzl), even if it is not infinite (unendlich). Lack of boundaries  or limits is an "extensive" property belonging to the manifold as such,  while infinitude depends on the metric.56 "That space is an unlimited </p><div id="pagenum"><p>triply extended manifold", says Riemann, "is an assumption involved </p></div><div id="pagenum"><p>106 CHAPTER 2 </p></div><p id="page">in every conception of the external world. At every moment, we  complete the domain of actual perceptions and construct the possible  place of sought-for objects in accordance with the said assumption,  which is being continually confirmed by means of these applications.  The unlimitedness of space therefore carries greater empirical  certainty than any other external experience. But its infinitude does  not in any way follow from this; for, assuming that bodies are  independent of position and that space is therefore of constant  curvature, space would be finite if that curvature had ever so small a  positive value. By prolonging into shortest lines the initial directions  on a surface element, one would obtain an unlimited surface of  positive constant curvature, that is, a surface which in a triply  extended flat manifold would take the form of a sphere, and which  consequently is finite. ,,57  These remarks open the way to further speculations about the  global properties of space, analogous to those made by 20th-century  cosmologists in the wake of Einstein. But Riemann cuts short the  flight of scientific imagination. "Questions about the very large", he  observes, "are idle questions for the explanation of nature." But such  is not the case with questions about the very small. They are of  paramount importance to natural science, for "our knowledge of the  causal connection of phenomena rests essentially upon the exactness  with- which we pursue such matters down to the very small".s8  Questions concerning the metric relations of space in the very small  are therefore not idle. If the size and shape of bodies is independent  of their position, space curvature is constant and its value can be  conjectured on the basis of astronomical observations. They show,  Riemann says, that it can differ only insignificantly from zero.  But if such an independence of bodies from position is not the case, no conclusions  about metrical relations in the infinitely small can be d{awn from those prevailing in the  large; at every point the curvature in three directions can have arbitrary values  provided only that the total curvature of every measurable portion of space is not  noticeably different from zero. Still more complicated relations can occur if the line  element cannot be represented, as was assumed, by the square root of a differential  expression of the second degree. Now it seems that the empirical concepts on which  the metric determinations of space are founded, namely, the concept of a rigid body  and that of a light ray, are not applicable in the infinitely small; it is therefore quite  conceivable that the metrical relations of space in the infinitely small do not agree with  the assumptions of geometry; and indeed we oUght to hold that this is so if phenomena </p><div id="pagenum"><p>can thereby be explained in a simpler fashion.59 </p></div><div id="pagenum"><p>NON·EUCLIDEAN GEOMETRIES 107 </p></div><p id="page">The intellectual freedom displayed by the young Riemann in the  preceding lines must have overwhelmed his audience. His last  suggestions reach well beyond Einstein's theories to some recent  speculations concerning the breakdown of space concepts in particle  physics.  2.2.10 Riemann and Herbart. Grassmann  Riemann names Gauss and Herbart as his only authorities. His  relations to Gauss ought to be plain by now. Let us dwell a little  further upon his relation to Herbart. In a posthumously published  note Riemann declared:  The author is Herbartian in psychology and in the theory of knowledge [ ... ] but on the  whole he does not subscribe to Herbart's philosophy of nature and the philosophical  disciplines related to it (ontology and synecho(ogy).60  Stimulated by this statement of philosophical allegiance, some writers  have sought to determine the specific influence of Herbart on Rie­ mann's philosophy of space and geometry. Bertrand Russell lists five  items in Herbart's writings which "gave rise to many of Riemann's  epoch-making speculations", namely, the psychological theory of  space, the construction of extension out of series of points, the  comparison of space with the tone and colour series, Herbart's  general preference for the discrete above the continuous and his  belief in the great importance of classifying space with other "mani­ folds" (called by him Reihenformen).61 Of these items, the third is  strictly Herbartian and has probably led to Riemann's general  description of a "manifold" as the set of specifications of a genus, a  description that better suits the manifold of colours and colour-hues  than it does the points of space. Classifying space with time is  commonplace in modern philosophy, and the word manifold  (Mannigfaltigkeit) had been employed by Kant to name the class to  which they both belong.62 Herbart's psychological theory of space  belongs to that part of Herbart's philosophy to which Riemann  professed allegiance, but I fail to perceive its influence on the lecture  of 1854, except insofar as it may have inspired its strong empiricist  bias. But then empiricism was rampant in Germany in the 1850's -due  in part to Herbart's lifelong work. Herbart's psychology purported to </p><div id="pagenum"><p>show how our representation of space can be reconstructed from </p></div><div id="pagenum"><p>108 CHAPTER 2 </p></div><p id="page">empirical beginnings; but psychogenesis has no place in Riemann's  lecture, the empiricism in which bears a logical stamp.63 (Riemann  does not speak of the origin of representations, but of hypotheses  lying at the foundation of a deductive science, which must be ac­ cepted or rejected in accordance with the success and simplicity of  the explanation they give of phenomena.) I do not know what Russell  had in mind when he spoke of Herbart's "general preference for the  discrete above the continuous", so that I cannot judge wherein such  preference shows up in Riemann's writings. As for the second item~  the construction of extension out of series of points, it presumably  refers to the construction of the line out of a pair of points in  Herbart's theory of the continuum or synechology (i.e. in one of the  parts of Herbart's system to which Riemann did not subscribe). The  first step in the construction is the following "extremely simple"  thought: "Two simple entities, which we denote by A and B, can be,  but at the same time cannot be, together.,,64 This simple but paradox­ ical thought generates a third entity between A and B which poses the  same paradox. Endless iteration of the paradox generates the line.  Providing that Herbart's construction works and is not just sheer  nonsense, we may conclude that it yields a dense point-set (like the  set of points assigned rational coordinates by a Cartesian mapping of  a Euclidean line), but not a linear continuum (i.e. a point-set struc­ turally equivalent to R). Herbart somehow acknowledges this limita­ tion of the proposed scheme when he declares that the line generated  by his construction is a "rigid" line, not a "continuous" one.65  According to him, a true continuum "does not consist of points, even  if it arises from them", and is therefore not a point-set.66 Riemann, on  the other hand, resolutely conceived of space as a continuous point­ set, endowed with a differentiable structure which he must have  known that a merely dense set cannot possess. A continuous point-set  cannot be constructed from its elements (in fact, this is the main  objection of the intuitionist school of Brouwer, Weyl, etc., to the  set-theoretical approach to continua). Riemann, however, is not  content to have the points of his extended quantities simply stand as  given in certain mutual relations. He outlines a so-called "con­ struction" of an n-dimensional manifold by successive or serial  transition, in certain well-regulated ways, from one of its points to the  others. But his construction is very different from Herbart's. </p><div id="pagenum"><p>Curiously enough, the same construction is formulated, almost in </p></div><div id="pagenum"><p>NON-EUCLIDEAN GEOMETRIES 109 </p></div><p id="page">Riemann's terms, in the context of an earlier proposal for the  generalization of geometry, the Theory of Extension published in 1844  by Hermann Grassmann (1809-1877).67  There is no evidence that Riemann ever read Grassmann. In fact  the latter's book was generally ignored by mathematicians until many  of his findings were rediscovered by others, and Hermann Hankel (in  1867) and Alfred Clebsch (in 1872) drew everyone's attention to his  pioneering work. However, since Grassmann's programme has so  much in common with Riemann's, a brief comparison would not be out  of order here. In a summary published in 1845 in Grunert's Archiv,  Grassmann describes his "theory of extension" as "the abstract  foundation of the theory of space (geometry)". "I.e_ it is the pure  mathematical science freed from every spatial intuition, whose spe­ cial application to space is geometry.,,68 The latter, "since it refers to  something given in nature, namely space, is not a branch of pure  mathematics, but an application of it to nature; however, it is not  merely an application of algebra, [ ... ] for algebra lacks the concept of  a variety of dimensions, which is peculiar to geometry. What is  needed therefore is a branch of mathematics whose concept of a  continuously variable quantity incorporates the notion of differences  corresponding to the dimensions of space. Such a branch is my theory  of extension".69 This theory overcomes the restriction to three  dimensions imposed on geometry by its physical referent. But not  only does Grassmann anticipate Riemann in his attempt at a general  treatment of "extended quantities"; in a specific methodological area  he appears more modern than his younger contemporary: he sets out  and develops a coordinate-free geometrical calculus - a "truly  geometrical analysis", as he calls ieo -which directly subjects points,  lines, etc., to algebraic operations. Nevertheless, Grassmann's theory  of extension is not a general theory of manifolds, but only a theory of  n-dimensional vector spaces with the usual Euclidean norm.  Compared to Riemann's theory, it is a rather restricted generalization  of geometry. Its limitation is probably due to the fact that in develo­ ping his general theory Grassmann simply took it for granted that  ordinary geometry was correct in its special (physical) field of ap­ plication. Riemann, on the other hand, educated at Gauss' Gottingen,  questioned this assumption from the outset, and this no doubt guided  the formation of his thoughts. By probing deeper he was able to give </p><div id="pagenum"><p>his theory a broader scope.71 </p></div><div id="pagenum"><p>110 CHAPTER 2 </p></div><p id="page">2.3 PROJECTIVE GEOMETRY AND PROJECTIVE METRICS  2.3.1 Introduction  The development of non-Euclidean geometry in Central and Eastern  Europe was half-hidden from the public owing to the obscurity of two  of its creators and the shyness of the third. In almost the same period,  the work of Jean-Victor Poncelet (1788-1867), who, in the limelight of  Paris, was laying the foundations of projective geometry, received  more attention. Partly because of its simplicity and beauty, and partly,  no doubt, because of its deceptive appearance of Euclidean  orthodoxy, the new discipline was in a short time well-known, ac­ cepted and taught in the universities, often under the alluring name of  'modern geometry'. Since there was no provocative negation  expressed in its name and since its radicalism was hidden beneath  seductive appeals to intuition, no philosopher ever raised his voice  against it. Yet, at bottom, projective geometry is much more 'un­ natural' than, say, BL geometry, which only negates a Euclidean  postulate whose intuitive evidence had been questioned for centuries,  while, in projective geometry, the basic relations of linear order and  neighbourhood between the points of space are upset. Projective  geometry ignoros distances and sizes, and thus may be regarded as  essentially non-metric.! Nevertheless, in 1871, Felix Klein (1849- 1925), following the lead of Arthur Cayley (1821-1895), showed how  to define metric relations in projective space. Making conventional  and, from the projective point of view, seemingly inessential varia­ tions in the definition of those relations, one obtained a metric  geometry satisfying the requirements of Euclid, or one satisfying  those of Bolyai and Lobachevsky, or, finally, a geometry where  triangles had an excess, as in spherical geometry, but where straight  lines would not meet at more than one point. In order to make these  results understandable to readers with no previous knowledge of  projective geometry, we shall present the main ideas of this geometry  in a more or less intuitive fashion in Section 2.3.2 which follows. A  rigorous analytical presentation of them will be given in Section 2.3.3.  Although an axiomatic characterization of projective space would  provide the best approach to such a thoroughly unintuitive entity, we  shall not give one because neither Klein nor his predecessors judged  it necessary or even useful and we wish to look at the subject as </p><div id="pagenum"><p>much as possible from their point of view. </p></div><div id="pagenum"><p>NON-EUCLIDEAN GEOMETRIES 111 </p></div><p id="page">2.3.2 Projective Geometry: An Intuitive Approach  The origins of projective geometry can be traced to the study of  perspective by Renaissance painters and architects. It was assumed  that one could obtain a faithful representation of any earthly sight  upon a flat surface S by placing S between the observer and the  objects seen and 'projecting' the latter onto S from a single point P  located inside the observer's head. The projection of a point Q in  space from Ponto S is simply the point where S meets the straight  line joining P to Q. The study of projections suggests, as we shall see,  a seemingly innocent device, which makes for greater simplicity and  uniformity. This consists in adding to every straight line an ideal point  or 'point at infinity'. The first modern mathematician to do this was  Johannes Kepler in 1604. Projective methods involving the use of  ideal points were successfully used in the solution of geometrical  problems by Girard Desargues (1591-1661), followed by Blaise Pascal  (1623-1662) and Philippe de la Hire (1640-1718). In the 18th century,  the value of these methods was eclipsed by the tremendous success  of analytical methods. The revival of projective methods in France in  the early 19th century owed much to the influence of Gaspard Monge  (1746-1818), one of whose pupils was Poncelet.  To explain the meaning and use of ideal points, we shall consider  the projection of one line on another from a point outside both. We  initially assume that Euclid's geometry is valid. Now, let m, n be two  straight lines meeting at P and let 0 be a point of the plane (m, n),  neither on m nor on n. Let A(O) be the flat pencil of lines through 0  on the plane (m, n). A(O) includes a line m' which does not meet m  and a line n' which does not meet n (Fig. 10). All other lines in A(O)  x  n'  n </p><div id="pagenum"><p>Fig. 10. </p></div><div id="pagenum"><p>112 CHAPTER 2 </p></div><p id="page">meet both m and n. If X Em, there is a single line in A(O) which  meets m at X. Let us denote this line by x. The projection of m on n  from 0 is the mapping which assigns to a point X in m the point x n n  where x meets n. This mapping is injective. It is defined on m­ {m n n '}. Its range is n -{n n m '}. Points near m n n I but on different  sides of it are mapped very far from n n m I, on the opposite extremes  of n; while points lying very far from m n n I, on the opposite  extremes of m, are mapped near n n m I but on different sides of it.  The domain of the projection is cut into two parts by m n n I and  within each part the projection is continuous (mapping neighbouring  points onto neighbouring points). The parallel lines m, m' (n, n') do  not share a point but they have the same direction. Let us use the  term 'a meet' to denote either a point or a direction. Instead of  saying that two lines p, q have a meet, Y, in common, we may say  that they meet at Y. Neighbourhood relations between the meets of a  line q can be defined very easily. Let P be a point outside q; then  every meet of q belongs to a line through P. A neighbourhood of a  line m through P is any angle with vertex at P containing points of m  in its interior. Let us say that m belongs to such an angle. (Obviously,  m also belongs to the vertically opposite angle.) Let X be the meet of  m and q. Then the meets of q with all lines belonging to a given  neighbourhood of m constitute a neighbourhood of X. It can be easily  seen that this definition of neighbourhoods on q does not depend on  the choice of point p.2 According to our stipulations, every neigh­ bourhood of the direction of a line q includes points on either  extremity of q. We now redefine the projection of m on n from 0 as  the mapping which assigns to every meet X of m a meet X' of n, so  that X and X' belong to the same line through O. The projection thus  defined is a bijection defined on the set of meets of m ; its range is the  set of meets of n. The projection is a continuous mapping.3 Hence­ forth, and in accordance with established mathematical usage, we  shall call every meet a point. A meet which is not a point in the  ordinary sense of the word is what we call an ideal point or a point at  infinity. A straight line m regarded as the set of its meets and  endowed with the neighbourhood structure induced on it by a flat  pencil through a point outside it, is called a projective line. As in  ordinary geometry, we use the term open segment to denote an open  connected (proper) part of a projective line.4 If A and B are any two </p><div id="pagenum"><p>points on a projective line m, m - {A, B} consists of two open </p></div><div id="pagenum"><p>NON-EUCLIDEAN GEOMETRIES 113 </p></div><p id="page">segments which join A to B. One of these segments includes the ideal  point (unless A or B is itself that point). Consequently, given three  points A, B, C on m, any two of them are joined by a segment which  does not include the other; it makes no sense, therefore, to say that  one of them lies between the other two. Four points on m, -A, B, C,  D-can always be grouped in two pairs, say (A, C), (B, D), such that  each segment joining the points in one couple includes one of the  points in the other; we say then that the points in each couple  separate the points in the other. On a projective line we cannot define  a linear order but we can define a cyclic order. This is only natural,  since neighbourhood relations on the projective line are based on the  neighbourhood relations of a flat pencil of lines through a point.  Let us consider now the projection of a plane on another plane  from a point outside both. To avoid repetition let us regard m, n in  Fig. 10 as the intersection of planes a, {3 with the plane (0, m nn',  n n m '). The projection of a on {3 from 0 is determined by the  intersections of a and (3 with all the straight lines through O. Let us  denote this bundle of lines by 0"(0). We regard every straight line on  a and (3 as a projective line and we let 0"(0) induce neighbourhood  relations on both planes. The projection is plainly a continuous  bijective mapping of a (including its ideal points) onto {3 (including its  ideal points). We agree to regard the set of ideal points on each plane  as an ideal straight line (where it meets every plane parallel to it).  Clearly, the projection maps straight lines onto straight lines and  preserves incidence relations between straight lines and points. (If m  meets m' at Q, the projection of m meets the projection of m' at the  projection of Q, etc.)  A plane endowed with an ideal line and with the neighbourhood  structure induced by a bundle of straight lines through a point outside  it is called a projective plane. This is a very peculiar sort of entity, as  we shall now see. Consider three points, A, B, C, on a projective  plane 1T. The lines AB, AC, BC divide 1T into four regions (Fig. 11).  Any two points within one of these regions are joined by a segment  wholly within the region. Two points belonging to two different  regions are joined by segments that cut at least one of those three  lines. We shall now assign a sense to the perimeter of each region,  namely, the sense ABCA. This is counterclockwise on Region I of the  figure, that is, on the region which has no ideal points. But on the </p><div id="pagenum"><p>other three regions, which meet the ideal line, the sense prescribed </p></div><div id="pagenum"><p>114 CHAPTER 2 </p></div><p id="page">appears to be clockwise on one side of that line and counterclockwise  on the other side. We therefore cannot assign a sense unambiguously  to every closed polygonal line on 7T. The projective plane is non­ orientable. It is also a one-sided surface, as we shall try to show. The  reader is presumably acquainted with the one-sided Mobius strip. We  shall show that it can be regarded as a strip cut out of the projective  plane. To do this, we shall construct several homeomorphisms which  will be useful later on.5 The projective plane can be mapped  homeomorphically onto the pencil u(O) of straight lines through a  point 0 not on that plane. Take a sphere S centred at O. We shall say  that x, yES stand on the relation E if a line of u(O) goes through x  and y (i.e. if x and y are either identical or antipodal). E is an  equivalence. The pencil can be mapped homeomorphically onto the  quotient set S/E. Take one half of S, including the equator that  divides it from the other half. If we agree to regard each pair of  antipodal points on the equator as a single point, we obtain a structure  homeomorphic to S/E. The perpendicular projection of this figure on  its equatorial plane maps it homeomorphically onto a circular disk  whose peripheral points are regarded as identical whenever they lie  on the same diameter. Two parallel chords equidistant from the  centre of the disk define a strip on it which is plainly homeomorphic  to a rectangle two opposite sides of which have been identified in  reverse order (Fig. 12). Such a rectangle is a Mobius strip. Through  the inverses of the homeomorphisms we have described, the Mobius </p><div id="pagenum"><p>strip is mapped homeomorphically onto a strip of the projective </p></div><div id="pagenum"><p>NON-EUCLIDEAN GEOMETRIES 115 </p></div><p id="page">Q P  P Q.  ci pi  2t pi ~~ Q'  Fig. 12.  plane. This does not prove, but somehow makes plausible that the  latter is also a one-sided surface.  If every plane in Euclidean space has been turned into a projective  plane, we can naturally regard the set of these planes as a new kind of  space, namely projective space. This space includes an ideal plane,  formed by all the ideal points that have been added to every ordinary  plane.  The ideal plane is determined by the pair of ideal lines where it  meets any two non-parallel ordinary planes. We cannot establish  neighbourhood relations in projective space by appealing to some  intuitively representable topological structure outside it (such as the  pencil u(O) we used in the case of the projective plane), because  every intuitive spatial configuration is comprised in it. We might,  however, attempt to define its neighbourhood structure from within.6  But we shall go no further in the consideration of projective space  until we have made the notion of a projective plane clearer and less  problematic.  2.3.3 Projective Geometry: A Numerical Interpretation  We have introduced projective space insidiously, by a series of  natural, apparently intuitive steps. The result arrived at is, however,  ostensibly counterintuitive and we cannot be sure that it is truly  viable. A contemporary mathematician would dispel our doubts by  producing an axiom system that unambiguously determines the struc­ ture we expect projective space to have and then proving its consis­ tency. But before the pUblication of Pasch's Lectures on Modem </p><div id="pagenum"><p>Geometry (1882), even the most distinguished mathematicians had a </p></div><div id="pagenum"><p>116 CHAPTER 2 </p></div><p id="page">rather poor grasp of axiom systems. In the matter of the viability of  projective planes and of projective space, they simply trusted their  instinct; or else, they constructed a real number structure and  identified it with the projective plane (or space). Though the latter  procedure may seem artificial to philosophical readers, it provides the  shortest way to understanding Klein's work on non-Euclidean  geometries. In presenting a numerical model of the projective plane,  we shall try to dispel any appearance of arbitrariness by introducing it  through a short motivating discussion instead of presenting it ready­ made like a rabbit out of a mathematician's hat.  Let ~2 denote the Euclidean plane and let x be a Cartesian  2-mapping. Let (Xl> X2) denote the point P E ~2 such that xl(P) = XI>  x2(P) = X2. A straight line m on ~2 is a set  m = {(Xh x2)luIXI + U2X2 + U3 = 0; Ui E R;  (UI> U2, U3) ~ (0,0, U3)}  We obtain the same line m if we mUltiply both members of the  equation UIXI + U2X2 + U3 = ° by an arbitrary real number k ~ 0. A  straight line m on ~2 is determined, therefore, by a set of linearly  dependene elements of R3, {(kUI, kU2, kU3)lk~ 0; (UI> U2, U3) ~ (0, 0,  U3)}' Let (Uh U2. U3), (VI> V2, V3) be two linearly independent elements  of R3. Then (Ui) and (Vi) represent two different lines m, n on ~2. If m,  n are not parallel, they meet at a point whose coordinates are the  solution of the following system:  UIXI + U2X2 + U3 = 0,  VIXI + V2X2 + V3 = 0. (1)  Let us mUltiply both sides of these equations by a real number P3 :# 0.  If we set P3XI = PI and P3X2 = P2, we obtain the system:  UIPI + U2P2 + U3P3 = 0,  VIPI + V2P2 + V3P3 = 0. (2)  This system has infinitely many linearly dependent solutions (kpl> kp2,  kp3), with k~ 0, P3:# 0, each one of which determines the same point  on ~2. The foregoing method furnishes a remarkably symmetric  representation of the points and the lines of ~2 by real number triples.  One asymmetry remains however: one of the first two terms of the  representative triple must be different from zero for lines, while the </p><div id="pagenum"><p>third term must be different from zero for points. Let us now </p></div><div id="pagenum"><p>NON-EUCLIDEAN GEOMETRIES 117 </p></div><p id="page">consider a pair of parallel lines. They are represented by the linearly  independent triples (Uh U2, U3), (Vh V2, V3) if and only if eqns. (1) have  no solution, that is, if and only if (Uh U2), (Vh V2) are linearly  dependent. Suppose Uj = kVj(i = 1, 2). We can now write eqns. (2) as  follows:  UIPI + U2P2 + U3P3 = 0,  UIPI + U2P2 + kV3P3 = o.  Subtracting the second equation from the first, we obtain  (U3 -kV3)P3 = o. (3)  (4)  But U3 ~ kV3, since the triples (Uh U2, U3) and (Vh V2, V3) are supposed  to represent different lines. Consequently  P3 = o. (5)  System (3) has indeed a solution but this solution, being of the form  (x, y, 0), does not represent a point of ~2. This is as it should be, for  parallel lines do not meet on ~2. Let us now endow each line on ~2  with an additional 'point' where it 'meets' all the lines that are parallel  to it. We know at once how to represent. these points, namely, by a  solution of a system of type (3), i.e. by a triple of the form (Ph P2,  0) ~ (0,0,0). Two of these 'points' should determine a 'line', namely,  the ideal line of the enriched plane. Can we represent that 'line' by a  real number triple? We ought to be able to determine it by solving the  following system  UIPI + U2P2 + U3P3 = 0,  u\q\ + U2q2 + U3Q3 = o. (6)  where the triples (pj) and (qj) represent two different ideal points, so  that P3 = q3 = 0 and consequently (Ph P2) and (qh q2) are linearly  independent. This implies that U\ = U2 = o. Since U3 is arbitrary, the  ideal line is represented by any triple of the form (0, 0, U3) with U3 ~ o.  We must exclude the case U3 = 0, because (0, 0, 0) is linearly depen­ dent on every other element of R3, and therefore cannot represent a  specific line.  For those to whom the projective plane, as it was introduced in  Section 2.3.2, is clearly conceivable, the method sketched above enables  a numerical representation of its lines and points. For those to whom, </p><div id="pagenum"><p>as we assume at the beginning of this section, the notion of the </p></div><div id="pagenum"><p>118 CHAPTER 2 </p></div><p id="page">projective plane presented in Section 2.3.2 is not clear, it may be  defined and have a sense bestowed upon it by means of the numerical  representation. One proceeds as follows. Let R3 denote R3 -(0,0, 0).  Let E denote the relation of linear dependence between pairs of  elements of R3. E is an equivalence. Let <;;2 denote the quotient set  R3/E. We call {/'2 the projective plane. If (Xi) = (X" X2, X3) belongs to  R3, we denote its equivalence class by [x;]. {/'2 is therefore the set  ([x;]l(x;) E R3; i = 1, 2, 3}. {/'2 is endowed with the strongest topology  which makes (Xi)t-+[Xi] a continuous mapping. In this topology, those  and only those subsets of {/'2 are open whose inverse image by the  said mapping is open in R3. We call [x;] a point of <;;2; the triple  (Xi) E R3 provides a set of homogeneous coordinates representing the  point [x;]. Hereafter, we shall usually denote each point of <;;2 by a set  of homogeneous coordinates representing it. Given a triple of real  numbers (u" U2, U3) ~ (0, 0, 0), the set of points in <;;2 denoted by the  solutions of the equation  3 L U;Xi = 0 (7)  i=1  is a line in {/'2. This line can naturally be denoted by the set (Ui) E R3.  Since the solutions of (7) are also solutions of  3 L kUjXi = 0 (8)  i=\  for any real number k~ 0, the line in question can be denoted by any  member of the equivalence class [Uj]. A line (Uj) is incident on (or  passes through) a point (x;) -which is then said to be incident on or to  lie on (uj)-if and only if I~=\ UjXj = O. Two or more points are  collinear if they all lie on one line; this line is their join. Two or more  lines are concurrent if they all pass through one point; this point is  their meet. It is merely a matter of algebra to prove that any two  points in {/'2 have one and only one join and that any two lines in <;;2  have one and only one meet. If plane projective geometry concerns  the properties and relations of the points and lines of <;;2, the proofs  of its theorems will consist of equations where different points and  lines are denoted by different elements of R3. Now, if we choose, say, </p><div id="pagenum"><p>the symbols (Pj), (qj), (rj),... to denote points, while (Uj), (v;), </p></div><div id="pagenum"><p>NON-EUCLIDEAN GEOMETRIES 119 </p></div><p id="page">(Wi), ... denote lines, the equations in which these symbols occur will  still hold if we let (Pi), (qi), (ri), ... denote lines, while (u;), (Vi),  (Wi), ... denote points. Consequently, any true statement of plane  projective geometry gives rise to a 'dual', that is, another true  statement obtained from the former by substituting point for line,  collinear for concurrent, meet for join, and vice versa, wherever these  words occur in the former statement. This is called the principle 0/  duality. In our numerical interpretation of projective geometry the  principle is trivial. But Gergonne (1771-1859), who formulated it as a  general principle in 1825, did not have this interpretation at his  disposal. He discovered duality by noticing pairs of complementary  or 'dual' theorems, proved under the usual intuitive (or pseudo­ intuitive) conception of the projective plane.  Our numerical interpretation of the projective plane shows that  projective geometry is at least as consistent as the theory of real  numbers. Since every theorem can be stated as a relation between  number triples and every proof can be carried out through a sequence  of ordinary algebraic calculations, any contradiction arising in pro­ jective geometry would show up as a contradiction in elementary  algebra. Though this result should remove the doubts expressed at the  beginning of this section, we shall now give a fully intuitive represen­ tation of the projective plane for the benefit of readers who stand in  awe of numbers. Let P be a point in Euclidean space ~3 and let i3  denote ~3 -{Pl. We define an equivalence F on i3 as follows: xFy if  and only if x and y lie on the same line through P. Consider the  quotient set i3/F. The 'points' of i3/F are the lines through P. Two  lines through P define a plane through P, which we shall call their  join. Two planes through P determine a line through P, which we shall  call their meet. With these stipulations the pencil of lines and the  bundle of planes through P furnish an adequate representation of the  projective plane. They can, in fact, be identified with [1;2, our numeri­ cal representation. If x is a Cartesian mapping with its origin at P, we  can represent a line m through P by the x-coordinates of anyone of  the points of i3 that lie on m. In this way, we assign a full  equivalence class of homogeneous coordinates in ,p to each meet of  i3/F, thereby mapping R3/E onto i3/F. We do likewise with the joins  of i3/F, i.e. the planes through P. Call this mapping /. It is not difficult  to see that if A is the join or meet of Band C in 1l3/E, /(A) is the join </p><div id="pagenum"><p>or meet of /(B) and /(C) in ifF. The existence of / shows that R3/E </p></div><div id="pagenum"><p>120 CHAPTER 2 </p></div><p id="page">and rj;J/F are isomorphic, i.e. that they both possess the same pro­ jective structure. Our intuitive representation of the projective plane  makes an important result immediately obvious. All planes through P  have the same status. We cannot select one among them to play the  role of the ideal line, except by an arbitrary stipulation. Consequently,  from a purely projective point of view there is no essential difference  between the ideal line and every other line. This is not so clear in the  numerical representation because the ideal line has a seemingly  peculiar equation (namely PJ = 0). But it could be inferred from the  principle of duality: there is no such thing as a privileged line in fJj)2,  formed by a distinguished class of 'ideal' points, because there is no  such thing as a privileged pencil, formed by a distinguished class of  lines.  The numerical representation of the projective plane suggests a  generalization which is assumed by Klein in his work on Non­ Euclidean geometry. Let C denote the field of complex numbers. If  (J = CJ -(0, 0, 0) and if E denotes the relation of linear dependence  between two elements of (3, we denote the quotient set (3/E by {P~.  We call this the complex projective plane. s Points and lines in ~~ are  defined in the same terms as in fJj)2. ~2 may be regarded as a proper  subset of fJj)~, formed by the equivalence classes [Ph P2, P3] one of  whose representative triples consists exclusively of complex numbers  whose imaginary part is zero. We call these points the real points of  ~~. By eliminating from ~2 the line U3 = 0 we obtain the so-called  affine plane, which is simply the Euclidean plane regarded as a proper  subset of the projective plane (and deprived, as such, of the Eucli­ dean metric structure). We shall denote the affine plane by ~2. For the  sake of completeness, we may mention that if R"+1 = R"+I- {O}, ("+1 =  cn+1 -{O} and E denotes linear dependence in one or the other of these  sets, fJj)" = R"+I/E and fJj)~ = C"+I/E are called, respectively, the real and  the complex n-dimensional projective space.  2.3.4 Projective Transformations  We shall consider two kinds of mappings defined on fJj)2. A collinea­ tion is a continuous injective mapping of ~2 onto itself that matches  points with points and lines with lines, preserving incidence relations  between lines and points. Let (Pi), (q;) denote points while (Ui), (Vi)  denote lines. The general analytic expression of the collineation </p><div id="pagenum"><p>(Pi)~(qi)' (Ui)t-+(V;) is </p></div><div id="pagenum"><p>NON-EUCLIDEAN GEOMETRIES </p></div><p id="page">3  kqi = L aijpj,  j=1  3  kUi = ~ ajiVj,  /=1 (/ajj/ # 0; i = 1,2,3; k# 0).  This mapping preserves incidence between lines and points since  3 1 3 3 L Vjqj = -k ViaijPj = L UjPj·  i=1 k i,/=I j=1 121  (1)  (2)  Let Aij denote the cofactor of aij in the matrix [aiil. The inverse of (1) is  then given by  3  k'Vi = L AijUj,  j=1  3  k'Pi = L Ajiqj,  j=1 (i = 1,2,3). (3)  A correlation is a continuous injective mapping which assigns a  point to each line and a line to each point in {!/'2, so that collinear  points are mapped on concurrent lines, and vice versa. We obtain  the general expression of the correlation (Pj~{Vi)' (Uj~{q;) by  simply interchanging (Vi) and (qj) in (1):  3  kVi = ~ aijpj,  /=1  3  kUi = L ajiqj,  j=l (/aij/ # 0; i = 1,2,3; k# 0). (4)  Let cp be a correlation. If P is a point in {!/'2, cp{P) is a line m in {!/'2,  fP(m) is another point Q. If cp{m) = cp(cp{P» = P, for every P in {!/'2, the  correlation is called a polarity. A polarity is therefore an involutory  correlation, a correlation which is its own inverse. It is easily seen  that if cp is a polarity which maps a point P on a line m, cp(fP(m» =  cp(P) = m. It can be shown that equations (4) define a polarity if and  only if ajj = ajj. The image of a point under a polarity is called its  polar; the image of a line, its pole. Two points P, Q are said to be  conjugate with respect to a polarity cp if Q lies on cp(P), that is, on the  polar of P; since cp preserves incidence and is involutory P must lie  on fP(Q), Two lines m, n are conjugate with respect to cp if m passes </p><div id="pagenum"><p>through cp(n); n, of course, passes through cp(m). Let fP: (pj~(Vj) be </p></div><div id="pagenum"><p>122 CHAPTER 2 </p></div><p id="page">given by  3  kVi = L aijpj, (!au! 'i' 0, aij = aji, k'i' 0, i = 1,2,3). (5)  j~l  If (Pi) and (qi) are conjugate points, (qi) lies on (vd; hence  (6)  A similar equation expresses the condition that must be fulfilled by  two conjugate lines. A point lying on its own polar and a line passing  through its own pole are called self-conjugate. A polarity is called  elliptic if it has no self-conjugate points (or lines) or hyperbolic if it  has at least one. It can be proved that a hyperbolic polarity has  infinitely many different self-conjugate points and lines. Take the  polarity given by (5). The condition for a point (Pi) to be self­ conjugate follows immediately from (6):  3 L ajjPiPj = O.  j.j~1 (7)  This is a quadratic equation whose solutions, if they exist (Le. if the  polarity is hyperbolic), are the points of a conic.Sa The tangent to the  conic at a point P is the polar of P. The condition for a line (Ui) to be  self-conjugate is of course  3 L ajjujuj = O.  i.j~l (8)  If (7) has solutions, (8) has solutions as well. They are precisely the  tangents to the conic defined by (7). The pole of each tangent m is its  point of tangency. A conic may be regarded as a set of points, or,  dually, as a set of lines, namely, the tangents that envelop it. If we  regard it both ways, (7) and (8) represent the same conic which may  be said to be its own image under polarity (5). This property of being  a locus of self-conjugate points and lines under a fixed (hyperbolic)  polarity is normally used to define conics in (real) plane projective  geometry. The definition does not depend on the numerical inter­ pretation we have made the basis of our discussion.9 If, in eqns. (7)  and (8), the matrix of the coefficients ajj happens to be singular </p><div id="pagenum"><p>(!ajj! = 0), of rank 2 or rank 1, those equations are said to determine a </p></div><div id="pagenum"><p>NON-EUCLIDEAN GEOMETRIES 123 </p></div><p id="page">degenerate conic; the points of such a conic lie on two lines or on a  single line, respectively, according to the rank of the matrix.  All these concepts can be defined analogously on the complex  projective plane ~~. Polarities of the form (5) are called projective.  Since every quadratic equation of the form (7) has complex solutions,  every projective polarity in ~~ defines a conic which is the locus of  its self-conjugate points. A projective polarity is called hyperbolic if  the conic defined by it includes real points and elliptic if all its points  are imaginary. \0 Let a denote the complex conjugate of a E C. An  injective, incidence-preserving, continuous involutory mapping  (Ud~(Pi)' (Pi)~(Ui) on ~~ is called an anti-projective polarity. Its  general expression is  3  kUi = L aijpj, (Iaijl ¥-0, aji = iiij, k¥-0).  i=1  Its self-conjugate points form an anti-conic given by  3 L aiiPiPi = O.  i.i=1 (9)  (10)  Two further remarks concerning ~~ will be useful later. Firstly, a  system formed by a quadratic equation ~~.i=1 aiiPiPi = 0 and a linear  equation ~:=I UiPi = 0 regularly has two solutions in C3. This means  that every conic in ~~ regularly meets every straight line at two  points. II The second remark concerns a particular kind of conics we  shall call circles, because of the formal analogy between their charac­ teristic equation and that of an ordinary Euclidean circle.12 They are  the conics defined by polarities whose matrix [aid has the form  l-~ -! a,+icJ  The equation of a circle is given therefore by  (PI -ap3)2 + (P2 -bp3)2 + C2p~ = O. (I 1)  Where does a circle meet the ideal line? According to our first  remark, at two points. We can calculate their coordinates by substi­ tuting in (11) the value P3 = 0 which characterizes all ideal points. We  obtain the equations </p><div id="pagenum"><p>P3= O. (12) </p></div><div id="pagenum"><p>124 CHAPTER 2 </p></div><p id="page">Two points of [jl~ satisfy these equations, namely (1, i, 0) and (1, -i,  0). They are both imaginary. Clearly, they do not depend on the  parameters a, b, c which define a given circle. Therefore every circle  meets the ideal line at these two points which are called the circular  points of [jl~.  2.3.5 Cross-ratio  We call the set of all collineations and correlations defined on 912 the  projective transfonnations of the (real) plane. (Real) plane projective  geometry will determine the properties and relations which are  preserved by (real) projective transformations. Some of them were  specified in the very definition of collineations, namely incidence  between points and lines, collinearity of points, concurrence of lines.  Correlations, on the other hand, map concurrent lines on collinear  points and collinear points on concurrent lines. If a line m passes  through a point P and if fP is a correlation, point fP(m) will lie on line  fP(P). Consider now a real-valued function f defined on (912)". We say  that f is an n-point projective invariant if, given any projective  transformation fP, f(Qh ... , QII) = f(fP(Q,), ... ,fP(QII»' for every set  of n points (or lines) {Qh ... ,Q,,} in 912. Sophus Lie showed that  there are no such invariants for n ~ 3. \3 This means, in particular, that  given a collineation fP and a function f: 912 x 912 ~ R, we cannot have  f(fP(P), fP(Q» = f(P, Q) for every pair of points P, Q in (JjJ2. It would  seem, therefore, that the concept of distance can have no place at all  in projective geometry. We shall see, however, that it can be intro­ duced in a roundabout way.  Lie shows that every 4-point (4-line) projective invariant is reduci­ ble to the so-called cross -ratio between four collinear points (four  concurrent lines)}4 If (P;) and (qi) are two different points of (JjJ2,  every point (Xi) on their join will satisfy the equation  XI PI ql  X2 P2 q2 = o. (1)  X3 P3 q3  It is easily seen that every solution of (1) has the form  Xi = kPi + mqi «k, m) ~ (0,0), i = 1,2,3). (2) </p><div id="pagenum"><p>(kpi + mqi) and (k'Pi + m'qi) denote the same point if and only if I ~ ~',I = O. Let Ph P2, P3, P4 be four collinear points such that </p></div><div id="pagenum"><p>NON-EUCLIDEAN GEOMETRIES 125 </p></div><p id="page">PI ~ P4 and P2 ~ P3• Let (Pi), (qi) denote two points of the line on  which the points Pr lie. Each point Pr (r = 1, 2, 3, 4) is then denoted  by (krPi + m.qi) for some pair of real numbers (k" mr), not both zero.  The cross-ratio of Ph P2, P3, P4 (in that order) is then defined by the  following equation:  (Ph P2; P3, P4) = I k2  m2 (3)  If P3 is (Pi) and P4 is (qi), (k3, m3) = (1,0) and (k4, m4) = (0, 1). In that  case  (4)  Since we are always free to make that assumption, it is clear that,  given three arbitrary collinear points A, B, C,  (A, A; B, C) = l. (5)  The cross-ratio of four collinear points depends not on the choice of  the homogeneous coordinates that represent them, but only, as we  gather from eqn. (5), on the parameters which determine the relative  positions of two of the points with respect to the other two, on the  line to which all four belong. The cross-ratio of four concurrent lines  is defined analogously. It is a matter of mere calculation to show that  the cross-ratio is preserved by projective transformations, i.e. that, if  ({! is a projective transformation, then, for every four collinear points  or concurrent lines Mh M2, M3, M4,  If (M!, M2; M3, M4) = -1 the four points or lines are said to be  harmonic; M4 is called the fourth harmonic to Mh M2, M3•  2.3.6 Projective Metrics  We are now ready to present Klein's interpretation of plane non­ Euclidean geometries. We shall see that it rests upon the introduction  of a metric, or rather, of a variety of metrics, in the complex  projective plane gp~. All that we have said in Section 2.3.5 concerning </p><div id="pagenum"><p>projective transformations and the cross-ratio applies, mutatis </p></div><div id="pagenum"><p>126 CHAPTER 2 </p></div><p id="page">mutandis, to ~t. Let ( be a conic in ~t. Let K, denote the set of all  collineations which map ( onto itself. The join of two points P, Q  meets ( at two points which we shall denote by (PQI()l and (PQI(h­ If 'P E K" each of these points is mapped on one of the points  (q;(P)q;(Q)I()i = q;«PQ/();), (i = 1,2). (1)  Since the cross-ratio is a projective invariant, it follows immediately  from eqns. (3) and (6) of Section 2.3.5 that  (P, Q; (PQI()J, (PQ/()2)  = (q;(P), q;(Q); ('P(p)q;(Q)/n, (q;(P)'P(Q)/()2). (2)  Let I, denote the complex-valued function (P, ~(P, Q; (PQI()J,  (PQI(h), defined on ~t x ~t;15 I, is preserved by every collineation  of K" since (2) implies that, for every q; E K,  t.(P, Q) = t.(q; (P),q; (Q». (3)  We now define a function d, on point-pairs of the complex projective  plane:  d,(P, Q) = c ·logt.(P, Q) (4)  (where c is an arbitrary non-zero constant and log x denotes the  principal value of the natural logarithm of x). The function d, has some  properties that make it a good choice for a (signed) distance function  on ~t. In the first place, d,(P, P) = 0 for every point P not on (. (See  eqn. (5) of Section 2.3.5.) In the second place, if PI. P2• P3 are collinear  points not on (,16  d,(PJ, P2) + d,(P z, P3) = d,(PJ, P3).  In the third place, if P and Q are different points not on (,  d,(P, Q) = -d,(Q, P). (5)  (6)  It is true that d, is undefined on a point-pair if one (or both) of its  members lies on (. But we can make sense of the statement that if Q  lies on ( then deep, Q) is infinite for every point P not on (. Suppose  that Q = [kpi + mqi] lies on ( and that (Qj) = ([kjPi + mjqiJ) (i = 1,2, 3;  j = 1, 2 ... ) is a sequence of points not on ( (but all on the same line  through Q) such that elk -kjl) and elm -mil) are null sequences. Then.  if P is a point not on ( lying on QQlold,(PQj)1 increases with j beyond </p><div id="pagenum"><p>all bounds. Therefore, if we persist in regarding d, as a distance </p></div><div id="pagenum"><p>NON-EUCLIDEAN GEOMETRIES 127 </p></div><p id="page">function we may say that the points on ( are infinitely distant from  the remaining points of !?P~. Still, d, has a property that is rather  unusual for a distance function: d, is complex-valued and, whatever  the value assigned to the arbitrary constant c, there will be, for every  choice of (, point-pairs (P, Q) such that d,(P, Q) has a non-zero  imaginary part. One ought not to dispute about names and every  mathematician should feel free to call a complex-valued function like  d, a 'distance function' on !?P~. But the 'geometry' thereby defined is  not what is known as a metric geometry in contemporary mathema­ tics.17 However, as we shall see, d, when restricted to a well-chosen  region of !?P~ does define a real-valued metric function. This is the  substance of Klein's discovery.  The development leading to the definition of d, can be dualized by  substituting any pair of lines m, n for the points P, Q. Then (mn/()I  and (mn/(h will denote, of course, the two tangents to the conic,  that pass through the meet of m and n. As a function on line-pairs, d,  seems to be a good choice for an angle-function, i.e. a function whose  value measures the size of the angle formed by its two arguments.  The choice is strongly recommended on account of the following  result due to Laguerre. ls Let m, n be two lines on the affine plane  ~2 C !?P~, which meet at a point P in ~2. We shall denote by m and n  the extension of m and n to !?P~, i.e. the sets of points in !?P~ that  satisfy the equations characteristic of m and n. There are two lines r,  r' that join P to the two circular points of !?P~ (r, r' have each only one  real point, namely Pl. As Laguerre showed, the ordinary Euclidean  value of the angle made at P by m and n is equal to 1/2i times the  natural logarithm of the cross-ratio (m, n; r, r'). The circular points  can be regarded as a degenerate line conic.19 If we let , denote this  conic and if we take c = 1/2i our function d, as defined on line-pairs  measures the size of Euclidean angles. This interpretation of  Laguerre's result was given by Cayley in 1859.20 By duality he  obtained a distance function defined on point-pairs of the affine  plane. Remarkably enough, this distance function is none other than  the ordinary Euclidean metric function. Cayley's discovery linked  angle size to segment length - a welcome achievement at a time when  projective geometry was regarded as a natural extension of ordinary  Euclidean geometry (and not as something utterly different from it, as  we regard it here). Indeed angles are the duals of segments, so that </p><div id="pagenum"><p>the measure of the latter should be the dual of the measure of the </p></div><div id="pagenum"><p>128 CHAPTER 2 </p></div><p id="page">former - a prima facie paradoxical requirement, given the notorious  differences between the two kinds of measure. 21  Cayley defined d, quite generally, relatively to an arbitrary conic "  which he called the Absolute.22 He writes: "The metrical properties of  a figure are not the properties of a figure considered per se, apart from  everything else, but its properties when considered in connection with  another figure, viz. the conic termed the Absolute".23 Cayley  considers two cases. When the Absolute is an ordinary (imaginary)  conic, we obtain the metrical properties characteristic of spherical  geometry; when the Absolute degenerates into the pair of circular  points at infinity, we obtain the metrical properties of ordinary plane  geometry. However, he disregards what seems to be the most natural  case, viz., when the Absolute is an ordinary real conic, such as an  ordinary circle. 24 It was Klein who first considered this case and  pointed out its relation to BL-geometry. Klein showed that dc,  judiciously restricted to a subset of rJ>~ in accordance with the choice  of " constitutes a metric function on the point-pairs and line-pairs  (i.e. on the segments and angles) comprised in that subset. Klein  considered three cases: 25  (i) , is a real conic. Let I, denote its interior, i.e. the set of real  points from which no real tangent to , can be drawn. d, restricted to  I, is a metric function. If lP E K, (i.e. if lP is a collineation that maps'  onto itself), lP/I, preserves dc/I" and is therefore an isometry. The  metric geometry thus defined on I, Klein calls hyperbolic geometry. I,  with this metric structure can be mapped isometrically onto the BL  plane. Consequently, hyperbolic geometry is esentially identical with  BL geometry.  (ii) ,is a purely imaginary conic. d, restricted to the real projective  plane rJ>2 is also a metric function. Klein calls the metric geometry  thus obtained elliptic geometry. In it, as in spherical geometry, trian­ gles have an excess, but two straight lines meet at one and only one  point. If lP E K" 1P/rJ>2 is an isometry. Elliptic geometry satisfies  Saccheri's hypothesis of the obtuse angle. This does not conflict with  Saccheri's refutation of that hypothesis, because straight lines in  elliptic geometry possess the neighbourhood structure of real pro­ jective lines, so that their points are ordered cyclically, not linearly - a  possibility which was of course excluded by the Euclidean premises  of Saccheri's argument. </p><div id="pagenum"><p>(iii) , is a degenerate conic. There are five different kinds of </p></div><div id="pagenum"><p>NON-EUCLIDEAN GEOMETRIES 129 </p></div><p id="page">degenerate conics on ~~,26 but Klein (1871) considers only one of  them, viz. { regarded as a locus of points consists of the ideal line  taken twice, while as an envelope of lines it consists of the two  imaginary pencils through the two circular points. In this case d,  restricted to the affine plane defines the ordinary Euclidean metric.  Klein calls this geometry parabolic. A special difficulty arises in this  case in connection with the definition of d, as a distance function on  point-pairs. The join of two points P, Q in ~2 meets the degenerate  conic { at just one point taken twice. In other words (PQ/{») is  identical with (PQ/{h, so that h(P, Q) = 1 and d,(P, Q) = o. Klein  avoids this difficulty by means of a limit operation in the course of  which he approaches the parabolic case from either the elliptic or the  hyperbolic cases.27 If (() E K" (()1~2 is not always an isometry but it  belongs to what Klein calls the principal group of transfonnations of  Euclidean space, formed by the Euclidean isometries (translations,  rotations, reflections) and similarities (bijective mappings of space  onto itself which preserve shape but mUltiply areas by a constant  factor). In his posthumous Lectures on Non-Euclidean Geometry  (1926) Klein briefly examines the other four degenerate cases. He  does not pay much attention to the resulting geometries because  angle-measure in them is not periodic - a fact that, in Klein's opinion,  makes them inapplicable to the real world, since "experience shows  us that a finite sequence of rotations [about the axis of a bundle of  planes] finally takes us back to our starting point".28  Klein's results are at first sight quite impressive. The difference  between Euclidean geometry and the two classical non-Euclidean  geometries (BL or acute-angle geometry and obtuse-angle geometry)  seems to depend merely on the choice of a particular kind of conic.  Now, from a purely projective point of view all conics are equivalent,  since they can be carried onto one another by projective trans­ formations. Thus the difference between these geometries would  appear to be inessential. The appearance is deceiving, however, for  the restricted domains of hyperbolic, elliptic and parabolic geometry  within ~~ are not projectively equivalent. Thus, if , is a real conic  and {' a purely imaginary one, and if (() is a collineation which maps {  onto {" (()(I,) must include some purely imaginary points. In other  words the (()-image of I" the hyperbolic plane, includes points not  comprised in (ijJ2, the elliptic plane. Analogous results occur with </p><div id="pagenum"><p>respect to ~2, the parabolic plane. In his Lectures Klein sometimes </p></div><div id="pagenum"><p>130 CHAPTER 2 </p></div><p id="page">uses the terms "hyperbolic" and "elliptic" as names for the  geometries defined by d, on the whole of fJJ~ (strictly speaking, on  fJJ~ -() when ( is a real conic or a purely imaginary one.29 Let us call  these geometries e-hyperbolic and e-elliptic (e for extended). We may  add e-parabolic geometry. These three geometries are indeed pro­ jectively equivalent. But they are not metric geometries in the  ordinary sense of the expression because d, is not a real-valued  function on (fJJ~ -(i. And, of course, e-hyperbolic geometry is not  identical with BL geometry nor is e-parabolic geometry identical with  Euclidean geometry.  Klein did not limit his consideration to the two-dimensional case, as  we have, but defined projective metrics for the three-dimensional  case too. As we know, the complex projective space fJJb can be  identified with C4/E, where C4 is C4 -{(O, 0, 0, O)} and E denotes the  relation of linear dependence in C4• Our discussion applies without  much change to fJJb if we take ( to be a quadric surface. If ( is a real  quadric and I, is its interior (i.e. the set of real points from which no  real tangent to ( can be drawn), d,II, defines the hyperbolic metric on  I, and we have an equivalent of BL-space geometry. If ( is a purely  imaginary quadric, ddfJJ3 defines the elliptic metric on the real pro­ jective space. Finally, we obtain the parabolic (or Euclidean) metric  on the affine space ~3 (i.e. '!P3 minus the ideal plane X4 = 0) by  restricting d, to 'jg3 when ( is the degenerate quadric formed by the  imaginary circle where every sphere meets the ideal plane X4 = o.  (Spheres are defined analogously with circles; see p.123.) Parabolic  geometry occurs in only one of the possible degenerate cases which  in three dimensions number fifteen.  Cayley accepts the numerical interpretation of fJJc without reser­ vation. This was, indeed, the only reasonable attitude before the  advent ofaxiomatics.30 Klein, on the other hand, believes that the  numerical manifold must be somehow grounded on intuition. The  snag is that the classical intuitive -or pseudointuitive -construction  of projective space depends essentially on Euclid's Postulate 5. Thus,  our method of projecting a line m on a line n from a point 0 on plane  mn but outside both m and n (pp.l1lf.) presupposes that there is a  unique line m' through 0 which does not meet m and a unique line n'  through 0 which does not meet n. But, if projective geometry rests on  Postulate 5, Klein's projective foundation of non-Euclidean </p><div id="pagenum"><p>geometries can hardly be consistent. We shall see in Section 2.3.9 </p></div><div id="pagenum"><p>NON-EUCLIDEAN GEOMETRIES 131 </p></div><p id="page">how Klein finally succeeded in establishing projective geometry on  what he judged was an intuitive basis, without resorting to Postulate  5.  Before studying the two- and three-dimensional cases, Klein  considers linear transformations on a (complex) projective line. They  are of two kinds: those that leave one point invariant (parabolic  transformations) and those that leave two points fixed. The latter fall  into two subclasses: hyperbolic transformations, in which the two  fixed points are real, and elliptic transformations in which the fixed  points are conjugate imaginary. The reader can satisfy himself that if  , is a conic (or a quadric) like those we have considered, a collinea­ tion which maps , onto itself will induce an elliptic, hyperbolic or  parabolic transformation in a fixed line if , is, respectively, imagi­ nary, real or equal to the two circular points (or to the imaginary  circle where every sphere meets the ideal plane). This terminology,  due to Steiner, is thus clearly the source of Klein's nomenclature. I  have not been able to verify the reason for Steiner's choice of words,  but it is easily guessed. Every linear transformation that maps a line  onto itself can be associated with a characteristic quadratic equation.  The transformation is elliptic, parabolic or hyperbolic, in the above  sense, if the discriminant of this equation is less than, equal to or  greater than 0, i.e. if the conic represented by this equation is an  ellipse, a parabola or a hyperbola.  Trained mathematicians who read Klein cannot have failed to  appreciate the point of his use of parabolic as the new, scientifically  grounded name of Euclidean geometry. The parabola is the excep­ tional conic, while the ellipse and the hyperbola must be viewed as  typical. Furthermore, Klein recalls that parabolic mappings of a line  onto itself are the special case, as opposed to the general one with  two real or two imaginary fixed points. "Correspondingly", he adds,  "there will be just two essentially different kinds of projective metrics  on fundamental figures of level one [i.e. lines and flat pencils]: a  general one which uses transformations of the first kind [i.e. non­ parabolic], and a special one which uses transformations of the  second kind [i.e. parabolic]. The ordinary metric on a flat pencil [i.e.  the familiar system for measuring the size of angles] belongs to the  first kind because in a rotation of the pencil about its centre two  distinct lines remain fixed, namely, the lines that go through the </p><div id="pagenum"><p>infinitely distant imaginary circular points. On the other hand, the </p></div><div id="pagenum"><p>132 CHAPTER 2 </p></div><p id="page">ordinary metric on the straight line [i.e. the familiar system for  measuring the length of segments] belongs to the second kind because  a displacement of the straight line along itself, under the assumptions  of ordinary parabolic geometry, leaves just one point unchanged,  namely, the infinitely distant point. .. 31 This difference between the two  fundamental metrical systems of geometry disappears in the elliptic  and the hyperbolic cases. This is as should be expected, if the latter  indeed are more general and consequently more natural.  2.3.7 Models  Klein's work is often linked to the construction of so-called Euclidean  models of non-Euclidean geometry. Thus. Borsuk and Szmielew, in  their well-known Foundations 0/ Geometry, describe a Beltrami­ Klein model of BLgeometry.32 We shall presently see to what extent  such a characterization of Klein's work is justified. Strictly speaking,  a model can be conceived only in relation to an abstract axiomatic  theory. If you are given a set of sentences S which contain undefined  terms tlo ... , tn. you can look for a model of S, that is, a domain of  entities where, through an arbitrary but consistent interpretation of  terms tt, ... , tn, the sentences of S come true. In this strict sense, we  cannot ascribe a model-building intention to Klein who, in 1871, did  not have the notion of an abstract axiom system. But we also speak  of models in a looser sense whenever a structured collection of  objects is seen to satisfy a set of mathematical statements, given a  suitable, though usually unfamiliar, reading of its key words. We thus  say that the pencil of straight lines through a point P in space  provides a model of the projective plane if we accept the following  semantic equivalences: 'a point' = a line through P; 'a line' = a  plane through P; 'point Q is the meet of lines m and m" = line Q is  the intersection of planes m and m'; 'line m is the join of points Q  and Q" = plane m is spanned by lines Q and Q' (p.119). In this looser  sense, Klein's theory does indeed supply models for Euclidean and  non-Euclidean geometry, but his models are projective and therefore  not Euclidean (because, as we have repeatedly observed, projective  space is not Euclidean space, Postulate 5 is false in projective  geometry. etc.). Thus parabolic plane geometry on the affine plane  '/;2 C £¥'~ provides a somewhat peculiar model of ordinary Euclidean  plane geometry: points are points and straight lines are straight lines, </p><div id="pagenum"><p>but distances between pairs of points and angles between pairs of </p></div><div id="pagenum"><p>NON-EUCLIDEAN GEOMETRIES 133 </p></div><p id="page">lines are defined with respect to a fixed entity located outside the  affine plane itself. On the other hand, hyperbolic plane geometry on  the interior of an ellipse may be viewed as a Euclidean model of  BL plane geometry if we no longer consider its domain of definition  to be a subset of ~~ and regard it as a region of the Euclidean plane.  Thus, we may define hyperbolic geometry in the interior of a circle  (0, r) with centre ° and radius r. A BL point is any ordinary point  inside this circle; a BL line is any chord (not including the points  where it meets the circumference of the circle). Let P be a BL point  and m a BL line not through P meeting the circumference of (0, r) at  A and B. There are two parallels to m through P, namely the two  chords that join P to A and to B (Fig. 13). These parallels divide the  chords through P into two groups: those that meet m and those that  do not meet m (scil. those that do not meet the chord m in the interior  of (0, r).) In order to complete the model we must introduce pro­ jective concepts. If Q and R are two points on m (inside (0, r», the  (undirected) distance between Q and R is taken to be equal to tllog(Q,  R; A, B)I.33 This value is preserved by all linear transformations (of  the entire projective plane) that map circle (0, r) onto itself. The  restrictions of these transformations to the interior of (0, r) play the  role of BL isometries (motions and reflections). This is, in essence,  the "Beltrami-Klein" model given by Borsuk and Szmielew. I leave it  to the reader to decide whether it is a genuine Euclidean model.  This model was found by Eugenio Beltrami (1835-1900) some time  before the pUblication of Klein's paper. In his "Saggio di inter­ pretazione della geometria non euclidea" (1868), Beltrami sets out to  find a Euclidean realization of BL plane geometry and discovers it in  a surface of negative curvature. The flat model we have just  described is only used as an aid in Beltrami's investigations. Beltrami  is aware that the new geometrical conceptions are bound to bring  about deep changes throughout classical geometry. But he is persu­ aded that the introduction of new concepts in mathematics cannot </p><div id="pagenum"><p>Fig. 13. </p></div><div id="pagenum"><p>134 CHAPTER 2 </p></div><p id="page">upset acquired truths; it can only modify their place in the system or  their logical foundations and thereby increase or decrease their value  and utility. With this understanding, Beltrami has tried to justify to  himself ("dar ragione a noi stessi") the results of Lobachevsky's  theory. Following a method he believes to be "in agreement with the  best traditions of scientific research", he has attempted "to find a real  substrate for this theory before admitting the need for a new order of  entities and concepts to support it" .34 To Beltrami's mind, a "real  substrate" is perforce a Euclidean model. He thinks he has succeeded  in his attempt as far as BL plane geometry is concerned, but he believes  it impossible to do likewise in the case of BL space geometry.35  Beltrami reasons thus: A "real substrate" for the BL plane must be  found in a curved surface in Euclidean space, since a Euclidean plane  can provide a model only of itself, unless we tamper with the ordinary  meaning of distance, and this he seems unwilling to do. It must be a  surface of constant G-curvature, for only on such surfaces can we  apply the "fundamental criterion of proof of elementary geometry",  namely, the superposability of congruent figures (la sovrapponibilitii  delle figure eguali). The most essential ingredient of a geometric  construction is the straight line. Its analogue on a surface of constant  curvature is the geodetic arc. The analogy breaks down on surfaces of  constant positive curvature, for there exist on them point-pairs which  do not determine a unique geodetic arc. How about surfaces of  negative curvature, or "pseudospheres" as Beltrami calls them? To  prove that every pair of points on a pseudo sphere is joined by one  and only one geodetic arc, Beltrami sets up a special chart with  coordinate functions u, v. Relative to this chart, the element of length  on a pseudosphere with constant curvature equal to -1/R2 is given by  (a2 -v2) du2 + 2uv du dv + (a2 -u2) dv2  ds2=R2~--~~----~~~~~~--~---(a2 _ u2 _ V2)2 (1)  The main advantage of this chart is that every linear equation in u and  v represents a geodetic line and every geodetic line is represented by  a linear equation in u and v. In particular, the lines u = constant and  v = constant are geodetic. The angle 6 formed by the lines u =  constant and v = constant at (u, v) is given by  uv  cos 6 = «a2- u2)(a2- V2»1/2'  . a(a2- u2- V2)1/2 </p><div id="pagenum"><p>sm 6 = «a2 _ u2)(a2 _ V2»1/:. (2) </p></div><div id="pagenum"><p>NON-EUCLIDEAN GEOMETRIES 135 </p></div><p id="page">Consequently, if either u = 0 or v = 0, 8 = 1T/2, so that all the lines  u = constant are orthogonal to v = 0 and all the lines v = constant are  orthogonal to u = O. The geodetic lines u = 0, v = 0 are called  fundamental. Formulae (2) show that the admissible values of u, v are  limited by the condition  (3)  Following the procedure sketched on pp.8lf., we can represent the  relevant region of the pseudosphere on a plane. Just let x be a  Cartesian 2-mapping and take the point (xil(u), X21(V» as the  representative of the point with coordinates (u, v). The region of the  pseudosphere covered by our chart is then represented by the interior  of a circle with radius a, whose centre lies at the origin of the  Cartesian 2-mapping x. Beltrami calls this circle "the limit circle" (il  cerchio limite). The geodetic lines of the pseudosphere are represen­ ted by the chords of the limit circle. In particular, the geodetic lines  u = constant, v = constant are represented by chords parallel to the  coordinate axes XI = 0, X2 = O. The interior of the limit circle is, of  course, none other than the Beltrami-Klein model of the BL plane we  met above. Beltrami only uses it to prove that a geodetic line on the  pseudosphere is uniquely determined by two of its points. In the rest  of his paper, he proves in detail that Lobachevsky's geometry is  satisfied on the pseudosphere if we identify BL straights with  geodetic lines. Any pair of geodetic lines can be chosen as  fundamental. The BL distance between two points is equal to the  ordinary Euclidean length of the geodetic arc that joins them.  Beltrami does not mention one important fact however, namely that  his pseudosphere possesses singularities on a part outside the region  onto which the BL plane can be mapped isometrically. For a pseu­ dosphere (Fig. 14) is a surface of revolution generated by a tractrix </p><div id="pagenum"><p>Fig. 14. </p></div><div id="pagenum"><p>136 CHAPTER 2 </p></div><p id="page">which is a curve with a CUSp.36 The singularities of the pseudosphere  are on the circle described by the cusp. We may ask if there exists a  surface in Euclidean space with no such singularities, onto which the  BL plane could be mapped isometrically. The question was answered  negatively by David Hilbert in 1901.37 In his paper, Beltrami suggests,  but does not prove, another very important negative conclusion: no  isometric model of BL 3-space can be constructed in Euclidean  3-space. The auxiliary representation of the BL plane as the interior  of a Euclidean circle can, of course, be generalized to any number of  dimensions. BL 3-space can thus be mapped homeomorphically onto  the interior of a Euclidean sphere.  As an immediate consequence of Beltrami's researches, we  conclude that the interior of the limit circle is indeed, as we have  stated, a model of the BL plane, with its chords representing BL  straights. This model can be used in constructing two more flat  models of the BL plane, which were discovered by Henri Poincare.  We shall call them the Poincare disk and the Poincare half-plane.38  We obtain them as follows. Consider a (Euclidean) sphere with its  centre at point (0, 0, 0) and its north pole at point (0, 0, 1). Let the  Beltrami-Klein model be given on the equatorial plane of this sphere,  the equator being the limit circle. We project the equatorial plane  perpendicularly onto the southern hemisphere: the limit circle goes  onto itself and the chords go over onto half-circles which are normal  sections of the southern hemisphere. These half-circles now represent  the BL straights. Let us now map the southern hemisphere stereo­ graphically from the north pole into the tangent plane through the  south pole.39 We thus obtain the Poincare disk, which is a circle  whose circumference lies on the image of the equator (Fig. 15). The  interior of the Poincare disk represents the entire BL plane. Since the  stereographic projection preserves circles and angles, BL lines are  represented by circular arcs orthogonal to the circumference of the  Poincare disk. The Poincare half-plane is obtained by a slightly  different procedure, mapping the southern hemisphere stereo­ graphically from the point (0, -1,0) into the tangent plane through the  point (0, 1, 0). The equator goes over onto a straight line which we  call the horizon. The southern hemisphere is mapped onto one of the  two half-planes determined by the horizon. This is the Poincare  half-plane. BL straights are represented on it by the semicircles and </p><div id="pagenum"><p>the straight rays orthogonal to the horizon. The straight rays are the </p></div><div id="pagenum"><p>NON-EUCLIDEAN GEOMETRIES 137 </p></div><p id="page">Fig. 15.  images of the semicircles orthogonal to the equatorial plane that pass  through the point (0, -I, 0). The distance between two points P and P'  on the Poincare disk or on the Poincare half-plane can be calculated  as follows. Let (PPI) denote the circle through P and P' whose centre  lies on the circumference of the Poincare disk or on the horizon of  the Poincare half-plane; let (PPI) meet that circumference or horizon  at Q and Q'; then, if (P, pI; Q, Q') denotes the cross-ratio of the radii  of circle (PPI) which pass respectively through P, P', Q and Q', the  distance between P and P' is equal to !log (P, pI; Q, Q').  2.3.8 Transformation Groups and Klein's Erlangen Programme  Our exposition of Klein's theory was based mainly on his first paper  entitled "On the so-called non-Euclidean geometry" (1871). In this  and the next section, we shall deal with some additional points  brought up in the second paper he published under that title (Klein,  1873). It is divided into two unconnected parts.40 The main purpose of  the first part is to prove that his projective metric geometries (elliptic,  parabolic, or hyperbolic) are the same thing as Riemann's geometries  on a manifold of constant curvature (greater than, equal to, or less  than 0). In order to show this, Klein states what he understands by an </p><div id="pagenum"><p>n-dimensional manifold: </p></div><div id="pagenum"><p>138 CHAPTER 2 </p></div><p id="page">If n variables x" X2, ••. , x. are given, the infinity to the nth value-systems we obtain if  we let the variables x independently take the real values from -00 to +00, constitute  what we shall call, in agreement with usual terminology, a manifold of n dimensiolls.  Each particular value-system (x" ... , x.) is called an element of the manifold:'  It is not clear whether "the real values from -00 to +00" are just the  values between these two extremes, i.e. all the real numbers, or  include -oc and +00. If they exclude the latter, an n-dimensional  manifold in Klein's sense is simply Rn. Now Rn is not the same as an  n-dimensional manifold in Riemann's sense (pp.86ff.), but if we  endow it with the usual differentiable structure, it is diffeomorphic to  any 'coordinate patch' (the domain of a chart) of such a manifold. On  the other hand, if Klein's variables may take the values -oc and +00,  an n-dimensional manifold in his sense is a very peculiar entity whose  topology would require some further specification. In the light of  Klein's usage in the paper we are discussing, I conclude that the truth  lies somewhere between the two alternatives: a manifold composed  of "real"-valued n-tuples turns out to be identical with !Jr. As we  know, this is not homeomorphic to Rn, let alone to any arbitrary  manifold in Riemann's sense. But it is not the same as the set  {(XI,' .. ,xn)l-oc:s;; Xi :s;; + 00; 1 :s;; i:s;; n}. Klein adds that in the course of  his arguments he will let the variables X" ... , Xn take arbitrary  complex values as well. This implies, in my opinion, that "an n­ dimensional manifold" in Klein's paper (1873) is but another name for  the complex n-dimensional projective space ~~. This may readily be  conceived as an n-dimensional complex differentiable manifold (i.e.  one with complex-valued charts).42 But it is not diffeomorphic to  every complex n-dimensional manifold. Nor does it playa special role  among them, like that of en (to which every complex manifold is  diffeomorphic locally).  I have dwelt at length on such scholastic niceties, as a prelude to  the following remark. Klein will show that Riemann's geometries of  constant curvature can be regarded as the theories of certain struc­ tures defined on (or in?) ~c. However, for Riemann, those geometries  are but peculiar members of the vast family of Riemannian  geometries, dealing with R-manifolds of arbitrary curvature. Within  this family the geometries of constant curvature are, so to speak,  degenerate cases. Hence by confining his discussion to structures  definable on a particular n-dimensional manifold, Klein loses sight of </p><div id="pagenum"><p>the full scope of Riemann's conception. Geometries of constant </p></div><div id="pagenum"><p>NON-EUCLIDEAN GEOMETRIES 139 </p></div><p id="page">curvature are taken from the context in which they were originally  defined, and granted a privileged status.  However this does not mean that Klein deals with them in isolation.  They have a well-defined position in a different system which, al­ though the ordinary Riemannian geometries are excluded from it, can  be extended to cover many new geometries. After his description of  n-dimensional manifolds, Klein sketches the main ideas of this  system. A more detailed exposition is given in the "Programme" he  submitted to the Faculty at Erlangen at the time of joining it.43 The  driving force behind it appears to be his desire to find a unifying  concept by means of which to comprehend and organize the wealth of  disparate discoveries in 19th-century geometry. He found it in the  concept of a group of transformations.44 We may characterize it as  follows. For any set S, a bijective mapping f: S--+ S is called a  transfonnation of S (into itself). Let T be the set of all transformations  of S. T has the following properties: (i) if f and g belong to T, the  composite mapping f . g belongs to T; (ii) if I belongs to T, the  inverse mapping rl belongs to T. Given that, for every I, g, h E T,  I . (g . h) = (f . g) . h, and I . rl is equal to the identity transformation  x~x (which belongs to T), T is a group, with group  product· (composition of mappings). Let G be a subgroup of T; G is a  translonnation group of S. If, for every xES and every.f E G,  whenever x has the property Q, I(x) has Q, we say that the group G  preserves Q. We may say likewise that G preserves a relation or a  function defined on S". Any property, relation, etc., preserved by G is  said to be invariant under G, or G-invariant.  Klein uses these ideas to define and classify geometries. Let S be  an n-dimensional manifold and let G be a group of transformations of  S. By adjoining G to S (as Klein says) we define a geometry on S,  which consists in the theory of G-invariants. If H is a subgroup of G,  the theory of H-invariants is another geometry, subsumed under the  former. The most general group of transformations of an n-dimen­ sional manifold mentioned by Klein is the group of homeomorphisms  (continuous bijective mappings whose inverses are continuous also).  The manifold ~c is endowed with the usual topology. Homeomor­ phisms form a group since the inverse of a homeomorphism and the  product of two homeomorphisms are homeomorphisms. The in­ variants of this group are studied by analysis situs (known today as </p><div id="pagenum"><p>topology). The hierarchy of subgroups of this group determines the </p></div><div id="pagenum"><p>140 CHAPTER 2 </p></div><p id="page">hierarchy of geometries. Klein's conception does indeed provide a  common framework within which can be situated many different  tendencies in the geometry of his day. The reader will easily under­ stand how the Cayley-Klein theory of projective metrics falls into  this scheme. The set of all collineations is a subgroup of the  homeomorphisms of gl>c. The set of all collineations that map a given  hypersurface ~ of second degree onto itself is a subgroup of that  group. The function d{ suitably defined on gl>c x gl>c is invariant under  this subgroup.45 Klein shows in the Programme how other, newly­ developed branches of geometry can be better understood in this  way. An important one which he does not mention is affine geometry.  This is defined on gl>" by the group of projective transformations that  map a given hyperplane onto itself. If we excise this hyperplane from  gl>n we obtain affine space.  It seems reasonable to regard two figures as equal, in a given  geometry, if one is the image of the other under a transformation  belonging to the characteristic group. Thus, in topology, a sphere is  equal to a cube (but not to an anchor-ring); in projective geometry, a  circle is equal to a hyperbola; in BL geometry only congruent figures  are equal. With the aid of the group concept we can establish  equivalences also between apparently different geometries. Let M be  a manifold on which a geometry is defined by a group G. Let f map M  bijectively onto an arbitrary set M'. The mapping g' = f· g . rJ (g E  G) is a transformation of M'. The set G' = {g'lg E G} is a trans­ formation group of M', which defines on this set what we may  reasonably call 'the same geometry' that G defines on M.46 Two  examples will show this: Let G preserve the property of being a  straight line on M. We shall say that f(a) is a 'straight' on M'  whenever a is a straight line on M. Obviously G' preserves the  property of being a 'straight' on M'. Likewise, if a distance function d  on Mis G-invariant, the function d': (x, y)~d(f-J(x), rJ(y», which is  a distance function on M', is G'-invariant.  When introducing the concept of equivalence between geometries,  Klein is on the verge of abandoning the narrow notion of a manifold  used in the paper of 1873. At times, it seems as though a manifold is  for him simply a structured set, its structure being determined by the  adjoined group. A geometry is determined not by the particular nature  of the elements of the manifold on which it is defined but by the </p><div id="pagenum"><p>structure of the group of transformations that defines it. One and the </p></div><div id="pagenum"><p>NON-EUCLIDEAN GEOMETRIES 141 </p></div><p id="page">same geometry will be defined on completely different manifolds by  structurally identical (isomorphic) groups of transformations. The  readiness to identify, say, straight lines with circles, planes with  points, if we can but set up among the former a structure equivalent  to one found among the latter, stems from the newly-acquired  awareness that structure (relational nets) is all that geometers really  care for. It is not the nature of points and lines (which nobody has  ever been able to explain) but how they stand to one another in a  system of relations of incidence and order which is the concern of  projective geometry, and this is sufficiently known once we know the  group which preserves this system. Klein's group-theoretical ap­ proach to geometry is a principal antecedent of the modern axiomatic  method, as developed in the late 19th century by Peano and his  school and by David Hilbert (Part 3.2). This method is based on the  assumption that the objects of a mathematical theory need not be  ascribed more than what is strictly necessary for them to sustain the  relations we require them to have to one another. The basic objects of  such a theory are determined just by its basic propositions, the  axioms that layout the relational net into which those objects are  inserted. Such a determination is as much as a mathematical theory  requires.  Klein's conception is, of course, narrower than the general struc­ tural viewpoint just expressed. Thus, Riemann's geometry of manifolds  will not fit into it. If M is an R-manifold of non-constant curvature, it  may happen that arc-length is preserved by no group of transfor­ mations of M other than the trivial one which consists of the identity  alone. But this trivial group cannot be said to characterize anything,  let alone the Riemannian geometry of M. Klein just shows how his  scheme can be extended to cover the geometries of constant curva­ ture. That these are equivalent to Klein's projective metric geometries  is doubtless true (subject to the qualifications discussed above). But  Klein's argument for this equivalence (Klein, 1873, §6) follows an  un-Riemannian line. He writes: "When we ascribe a definite, con­ stant non-vanishing curvature to a manifold, we are specifying the  mere concept of an n-fold extended manifold by adding to it [ ... J, as  a further determination, a transformation group which is constructed  in well-known fashion by requiring free mobility of rigid bodies".47  Beltrami has shown "that in a manifold of constant curvature the </p><div id="pagenum"><p>coordinates can be chosen so that geodetic lines are represented by </p></div><div id="pagenum"><p>142 CHAPTER 2 </p></div><p id="page">linear equations".48 From Klein's point of view, this is stated as  follows: "The transformation group adjoined to a manifold when we  ascribe to it a constant curvature is contained, for a suitable choice of  coordinates, in the group of linear transformations." In the light of his  own study of projective metrics Klein concludes: "The trans­ formation group which preserves the metric on a manifold of constant  curvature consists, for a suitable choice of coordinates, in the group  of linear transformations that preserve a given quadratic equation".49  Whereas Riemann held free mobility of figures -without dilation or  contraction -to be a consequence of the metric structure of manifolds  of constant curvature and of their characteristic symmetries, Klein  conceives it as a result of the in variance of certain properties and  relations under a given group. This is the primary fact. A suitable  choice of coordinates enables him to find an elegant analytic  representation of this group, from which the curvature and the  remaining properties of the manifold can be computed.  Interest in Riemannian geometry increased considerably after Ricci  and Levi-Civita (1901) created the tensor calculus and Einstein (1916)  used a four-dimensional semi-Riemannian manifold of non-constant  curvature to represent physical space-time.50 Some attempts were  made to incorporate Riemannian geometry in Klein's scheme.  Schouten suggested the following use of Klein's concept of ad­ junction: A Riemannian structure is defined on a differentiable mani­ fold by "adjoining" a given quadratic differential expression to the  group of diffeomorphic transformations of the manifold.51 Elie Cartan  objects that this deprives Klein's concept of all meaning. "En pous­ sant jusqu'au bout l'extension abusive faite du principe d'adjonction,  on pourrait dire que tout probleme mathematique rentre dans Ie cadre  du programme d'Erlangen; il suffit d'adjoindre au groupe de toutes les  transformations possibles les donnees du probleme a resoudre." (E.  Cartan, 1927, p.203). Cartan's own approach is much subtler. A  description of it lies beyond the scope of this book. Cartan's ideas  have led to the very fruitful application of group theory to modern  differential geometry. But they go beyond the bounds of the Erlangen  programme. Recent writers neatly distinguish Klein geometry, which  deals with structures governed by the Erlangen scheme, from  differential geometry, the general theory of differentiable manifolds. </p><div id="pagenum"><p>(See Jasinska and Kuchrzewski, (1974).) </p></div><div id="pagenum"><p>NON-EUCLIDEAN GEOMETRIES 143 </p></div><p id="page">2.3.9 Projective Coordinates for Intuitive Space  The second part of Klein (1873) studies an important matter we  mentioned briefly on p.131 namely "the possibility of constructing  projective geometry [ ... ] without assuming the axiom of parallels".52  To "construct projective geometry" apparently means here to put the  numerical manifold studied in the first part of the paper in connection  with the intuitive space which Klein believed was the proper sub­ ject-matter of geometry. Klein's proof of possibility consists in  showing that any intuitively accessible spatial region can be mapped  bijectively onto an open subset of the real projective manifold fJJl3 in  such a way that the intuitive relations of neighbourhood and order are  preserved by the mapping. Each point of the region is thereby  assigned a unique point of fJJl3, that is, an equivalence class of real  homogeneous coordinates. Any intuitively given space can, in this  sense, be embedded in fJJl3 -and consequently in fJJlt also -and be  identified with a part of it.  A method for assigning homogeneous coordinates to the points of  space had been developed by von Staudt. In his paper of 1871, Klein  asserts, without proof, that von Staudt's method does not depend on  the axiom of parallels. 53 In 1873, he sets out to prove this assertion.  The proof presupposes only that space can be analyzed into points,  straight lines and planes in the familiar fashion, and that it is  continuous in the sense that we shall define below. The assumption of  continuity was formulated in Klein (1874).  Von Staudt had shown how to associate a unique point to three  given collinear points. For simplicity's sake, we restrict our dis­ cussion to the plane, but von Staudt's construction can be easily  extended to three-dimensional space. Let A, Band C be three  collinear points (Fig. 16). Choose three lines, p, q, r, such that p and  q go through A and not through B while r goes through B and not  through A. r meets p at P and q at Q. Denote the join of P and C by  s. s meets q at S. Denote the join of Band S by t. t meets p at T. The  join of T and Q meets line AB at D. D is determined by A, Band C  and does not depend on the choice of p, q and r. Moreover, if we  exchange A and B, we obtain the same point D. The construction can  be dualized to obtain a unique line d associated with three concurrent </p><div id="pagenum"><p>(coplanar) lines a, band c. </p></div><div id="pagenum"><p>144 CHAPTER 2 </p></div><p id="page">q  Fig. 16.  We have made no stipulations regarding the relative distances of  points A, B, C. Indeed, we need not even assume that the concept of  distance can be meaningfully applied to them. However, if A and B  lie on a Euclidean plane a and C happens to be the midpoint of  segment AB, we can easily verify that the join of T and Q is parallel  to AB, so that point D does not exist (unless we place it 'at infinity').  In the dual construction, of course, line d will always be found to  exist. If c happens to form equal angles with a and b, d is perpendi­ cular to c. Define nC'w a Cartesian 2-mapping x: a -jo R2. If PEa,  denote by P the number triple (x1(P), x2(P), 1). The mapping Pt--+P  assigns a set of homogeneous coordinates to each point PEa. If Dis,  as above, the point associated by von Staudt's construction with three  collinear points A, Band C on a, it can be shown that the cross-ratio  (A, B; C, D) = -1. In other words, D is the fourth harmonic to A, B  and C. Hence, it is not unnatural to describe von Staudt's construction  as a method for finding the 'fourth harmonic' to three given  collinear points (or to three concurrent coplanar lines) in Euclidean  space.  Hereafter, we use this terminology regardless of its Euclidean  motivation. We simply call a line (or a point) the fourth harmonic to  three coplanar concurrent lines (collinear points) if it can be asso­ ciated with them by von Staudt's construction. Given three coplanar  concurrent lines u, v and w, we say that a line m belongs to the  harmonic net (uvw) if m = u or m = v or m = w or m is the fourth  harmonic to three lines belonging to (uvw). A harmonic net of </p><div id="pagenum"><p>collinear points is defined analogously. </p></div><div id="pagenum"><p>NON-EUCLIDEAN GEOMETRIES 145 </p></div><p id="page">As I said above, we shall postulate that space is continuous in the  following sense: If X is a flat pencil of lines, partitioned into two  subSets Xl and X2 such that no pair of lines of Xl is separated by a  pair of lines of X2, there exists a pair of lines a, b in X which  separates every line in Xl -{a, b} from every line in X2 -{a, b}.  Zeuthen proved that if this is assumed, then, for every flat pencil X  and every harmonic net Y contained in X, each pair of lines belonging  to X is separated by a pair of lines belonging to Y. This means that Y  is everywhere dense in X. We shall refer to the foregoing assertion as  Zeuthen's lemma.54  Let us add an object 00 to the field Q of rational numbers, postulat­ ing that 00 + 00 = 00, 00 -00 = 0, 00/00 = 1; that for every a E Q, 00 > a,  00 + a = 00, oo/a = 00, a/oo = 0, and that if a#-0, a/O = 00. Any harmonic  net (uvw) contained in a flat pencil X can be mapped injectively into  o U{oo}, in the following standard fashion. We assign the numbers 0, 1  and 00 to u, v and w, respectively. We agree that if a, band c are the  numbers assigned to three lines of the net, their fourth harmonic be  assigned the number x determined by equation  (x-b)(c-a)=_l  (x-a)(c-b) . (1)  In particular, the fourth harmonic to u, v and w will be assigned the  number 1/2; the fourth harmonic to u, wand v, the number -1. The  reader should satisfy himself by studying von Staudt's construction  that this mapping preserves cyclic order: if a < b, the lines numbered  a, b separate the lines numbered c, 00 if, and only if, a < c < b.  Zeuthen's lemma implies that the image of the harmonic net (uvw) by  this mapping is everywhere dense in R U{oo}. It is clear, on the other  hand, that not every line in the pencil X can belong to the net (UVW).55  We shall nevertheless define an extended harmonic net (uvw)' which  incllldes every line in X. Let a, alo a2, ... and b, blo b2, ... be two  monotonic sequences of rational numbers which belong to the image  of (uvw) by the above mapping and converge to the same real  number c (a < c < b). Since the image of (uvw) is everywhere dense  in R, such sequences exist for every c E R. Continuity implies that  there is a unique line m in X such that m and w separate every line in  the first sequence from every line in the second. We assign to m the  real number c. The extended net (uvw)' is formed by every line which </p><div id="pagenum"><p>belongs to (uvw) or is assigned a real number by the foregoing rule. </p></div><div id="pagenum"><p>146 CHAPTER 2 </p></div><p id="page">Obviously (uvw)' = X. Moreover, our rules for assigning numbers to  the lines of (uvw)' determine a bijective mapping of X onto R U{oo},  which preserves cyclic order in the way explained above.  We shall now show how to assign homogeneous coordinates to  every point of a finite region of the plane using von Staudt's con­ struction. To avoid unnecessary complications, we consider a convex  plane region S (i.e. a region such that if points A and B lie on it, the  entire segment AB is contained in it). Choose two straight lines p and  q which meet at a point 0 in S. Pick three more points in S, one on p  one on q, one outside both lines. (The reader is advised to draw a  diagram.) We denote these points by P, Q and E. respectively.  Consider the flat pencil through P. We assign the numbers 0, 1 and 00  to lines PO (that is p), PE and PQ, respectively. This determines, as  we know, a mapping of the entire pencil through Ponto R U{oo}. We  do the same with the pencil through Q, assigning ° to QO, 1 to QE  and 00, once more, to QP. Let X be any point of S. Then, unless X lies  on line PQ, X is the meet of a line through P and a line through Q. Let  u and v be the numbers assigned, respectively, to those two lines by  the above mappings. We assign to X the class of homogeneous  coordinates [u, v, 1]. If X lies on PQ, the segment joining X to 0 is  entirely contained in S. Let Y be a point on this segment, distinct  from X and o. Y is, of course, the meet of a line through P,  numbered, say, s, and a line through Q, numbered t. We assign to X  the class [s, t, 0]. It is readily seen that this assignment does not  depend on the choice of Y. In particular, according to this rule P is  assigned the class [0, 1,0] and Q, the class [1,0,0]. As we know, each  equivalence class of real homogeneous coordinates of the form [XI>  X2, X3] (Xj~ ° for some value of j) is a point of g>2. We have therefore  defined a mapping of S into g>2. The mapping is obviously injective. It  maps collinear points of S on collinear points of g>2.56 If P is the image  of a point PES by this mapping, then every neighbourhood of P (in  the topology defined on p.118) contains the image of some neigh­ bourhood of P (in the intuitive sense of the word 'neighbourhood').  We can easily define a similar mapping of any convex spatial region V  into g>3. This mapping can be extended to any convex region V' which  contains V. In this way, intuitive space can be identified with a part of  g>3 and projective geometry can be said to be grounded on spatial </p><div id="pagenum"><p>intuition. </p></div><div id="pagenum"><p>NON-EUCLIDEAN GEOMETRIES 147 </p></div><p id="page">2.3.10 Klein's View of Intuition and the Problem of Space-Forms  The preceding discussion involves a view of geometric intuition and  its role in science which is expressed by Klein in several of his  writings.57 He apparently believed that every normal human adult has  the ability to form geometrical images according to a fixed pattern.  This faculty or its exercise he called intuition (Anschauung). Intuition  lies at the root of scientific geometry and is an indispensable aid in  geometric discovery. Klein at one point states that geometric intuition  is an inborn talent. He holds, however, that it is developed by  experience. "Mechanical experiences, such as we have in the  manipulation of solid bodies, contribute to forming our ordinary  metric intuitions, while optical experiences with light-rays and  shadows are responsible for the development of a 'projective' in­ tuition".58 However, geometric intuition is insufficient for unam­ biguously determining geometric notions and for deciding between  certain incompatible geometrical propositions. Klein proposes the  following case in point. After choosing a straight line m within one's  grasp, one imagines a point P in Syrius. Either there is but one line  through P which is parallel to m or there are many such lines, lying  very nearly at right angles with the perpendicular from P to m. Which  is the case? We must acknowledge the impotency of intuition to  decide the issue. Either alternative is compatible with it. Either one  involves an 'idealization' of intuitive data, i.e. the introduction, by  intellectual fiat, of precision not possessed by the data. The tendency  to idealize is strong in ordinary perception: we see surfaces as smooth  and flat which, under careful observation, exhibit minute ir­ regularities.59 Scientific geometry carries idealization to a limit:  widthless lines and dimensionless points replace the strips and dots of  intuition. Familiarity with these idealized objects develops what Klein  calls a "refined intuition" which should not be confused with the  "naive intuition" we have been speaking about. Such "refined in­ tuition" is required for following many of the proofs in Euclid. But  then, "refined intuition is not properly an intuition at all, but arises  through the logical development from axioms considered as perfectly  exact" .(1.)  Klein advances the idea that naive geometric intuition has a </p><div id="pagenum"><p>threshold of exactness which does not meet the requirements of </p></div><div id="pagenum"><p>148 CHAPTER 2 </p></div><p id="page">traditional geometric thought. This idea was suggested to him by the  psychoiogical notion of a threshold of sensation, below which stimuli  fail to arouse consciousness. The idea was first introduced by Klein in  a lecture (l873b) intended to make Weierstrass' nowhere-differenti­ able continuous functions more palatable to scientists. Given a  Cartesian 2-mapping Z, the graph of a function f: R ~ R can be  represented on the plane by the set F={Z-l(X,f(x» Ix ER}. If f is  continuous (in the technical sense) and injective, F must be a width­ less, gapless curve (in the intuitive sense). If t is nowhere differenti­ able, this curve nowhere has a definite direction: if P is any point of  F, there is no tangent to F at P. This is generally held to be  counter-intuitive. But, Klein observes, a departure from intuition is  already involved in the notion of a continuous function f: R ~ R.  Such a function assigns a real number to every real number, or, if you  wish, a point on a widthless, gapless line to every point on a  widthless, gapless line. But intuitive lines are actually narrow strips.  They are, of course, gapless because between any two non-overlap­ ping dots in them we can always mark a third dot (which possibly  overlaps with each of the former). The idealizing move that takes us  from narrow strips to widthless lines, which are continuous sets of  dimensionless points, is not blatantly counterintuitive; it can even be  said to be suggested by intuition. But it, in fact, goes beyond intuition,  and we must not be surprised if it eventually leads to the notion of a  directionless curve, which is unimaginable. We find an analogous  development in the foundations of projective geometry: projective  intuition (if such a thing exists) suggests the existence of a 'point at  infinity' which comes after every finitely distant point on both ex­ tremities of a straight line.61 If we adopt it, we are led inevitably to  postulating a line at infinity on every plane, and a plane at infinity in  three-dimensional space. But we cannot, by any stretch of the im­ agination, attach an intuitive content to the latter plane.  In the wake of these remarks it should come as a surprise to learn  that Klein rejected Pasch's use of the axiomatic method. Pasch  demanded that the full intuitive content of geometry should be  expressed in axioms, from which the remaining geometrical truths  would be derived by strict deductive inference (Section 3.2.5). Thus,  geometrical questions could be settled by an appeal to the axioms,  without our having ever to bring in intuition. Klein objects: "I find it </p><div id="pagenum"><p>impossible to develop geometrical considerations unless I have </p></div><div id="pagenum"><p>NON-EUCLIDEAN GEOMETRIES 149 </p></div><p id="page">constantly before me the figure to which they refer [ ... J. A purely  calculating analytic geometry, which does away with figures, cannot  be regarded as genuine geometry [ ... ]. An axiom is a demand that  compels me to make exact statements out of inexact intuition." ("die  Forderung, vermoge deren ich in die ungenaue Anschauung genaue  Aussagen hineinlege", -Klein (1890), p.571.) I, for my part, fail to see  how an admittedly imprecise image can be of any help in the actual  proof of statements concerning the unambiguous ideal entities  determined by the axioms. (Compare Klein, Elementarmathematik,  Vol. III, p.8.)  The limitations of geometric intuition give rise to an interesting  problem to which Klein devoted some attention in his later writings  on non-Euclidean geometry. All that we can represent to ourselves in  our imagination lies in a finite region of space; neither our inborn  geometric intuition (if we have one) nor the increased intuitive  abilities we acquire through mechanical and optical experiences can  help us in any way to visualize the whole of space. Geometry  determines through idealization the exact (topological, projective,  metric) structure that we ascribe to the spatial region which we are  able to imagine. Does this postulated exact structure determine the  global structure of space as well? Not at all. We know already that a  region homeomorphic to a connected subset of Euclidean 3-space can  belong to many very different topological spaces. The definition of a  metric on the intuitively accessible spatial region restricts the set of  globally different spaces to which this region can belong, but even  then their diversity is astonishing. Klein arrived at this remarkable  conclusion guided by W.K. Clifford's discovery of a class of surfaces  in elliptic 3-space which are locally isometric to the Euclidean plane.62  Euclidean parallels are coplanar non-intersecting everywhere  equidistant straight lines. There are congruence-preserving trans­ formations of Euclidean space -parallel translations -which map  each member of a given family of parallel lines onto itself. Euclidean  parallels exist only in Euclidean space. In BL space there are  coplanar non-intersecting straight lines. Denote a set of such lines by  f. Since no pair of members of f are everywhere equidistant there is  no congruence-preserving transformation of BL space (except the  identity) which maps each member of f onto itself. Non-intersecting  coplanar straight lines of BL space lack therefore the most interesting </p><div id="pagenum"><p>property of Euclidean parallels. A better analogy to Euclidean </p></div><div id="pagenum"><p>150 CHAPTER 2 </p></div><p id="page">parallels might be provided by everywhere equidistant skew (i.e.  non-coplanar and consequently non-intersecting) lines. Do such lines  exist? Let us place ourselves in a three-dimensional space of arbitrary  constant curvature. Suppose m and n are two everywhere-equidistant  skew lines. Choose two points A, B on m. The perpendiculars from m  to n at A and B meet n at A' and B', respectively. AA' = BB'. AA'BB'  is a skew rectangle. It can be shown that AB = A'B' and that the right  triangle ABB' has an excess. (Bonola, NEG, p.201.) Consequently,  everywhere-equidistant skew lines cannot exist in Euclidean or in BL  space. Clifford showed however that real lines satisfying this descrip­ tion do exist in three-dimensional elliptic space. We call them C­ parallels (C for Clifford). To see how they can be constructed let us  recall that the congruence-preserving transformations of elliptic 3- space -the elliptic motions -are the collineations of !'P~ which map a  given imaginary quadric , onto itself. , has two families of (im­ aginary) rectilinear generators, F and F'. There are elliptic motions,  which we shall call displacements of Class 1, which map every line in  F' onto itself while displacing each point P on any line m E F along  the line in F' that meets m at P. For any given displacement f of  Class 1, there are two conjugate imaginary lines m), m2 in F, such that  for every P E mi f(P) = P (i = 1,2). We say that f fixes m, and m2  pointwise. Displacements of Class 2 are characterized by interchang­ ing F and F' in the description of displacements of Class 1. If we  regard the identity as belonging to both classes of displacements, we  may say that every elliptic motion is the product of a displacement of  Class 1 and a displacement of Class 2. Let f denote the displacement  of Class 1 (not the identity) which fixes pointwise the lines m) and m2  in F. Consider now the family of straight lines r, = {m 1m is real and  m meets, on m, and m2}. If mEr" f fixes two points on m, so that f  maps m onto itself. Since f is an elliptic motion, any two lines in f,  are everywhere equidistant. rj is therefore a family of C-parallels.  Every displacement of Class 1 (except the identity) determines thus a  family of C-parallels in elliptic space. Two lines belonging to such a  family will be called C,-parallel. C2-parallels are defined likewise, by  substituting 'Class 2' for 'Class l' in the foregoing discussion. Let Q  be a real line which meets, at P, and P2• Pi is the meet of two  generators gi E F and hi E F' (i = 1, 2). Let P be a real point not on Q.  There is exactly one line b through P which meets' on g, and g2; </p><div id="pagenum"><p>there is also one line b' through P which meets, on h, and h2• Clearly </p></div><div id="pagenum"><p>NON·EUCLIDEAN GEOMETRIES 151 </p></div><p id="page">a and b (b') are Ct· (C2-) parallel. If P lies on the polar63 of a, then b  and b' coincide. If three lines a, b, care Ct-(Cr) parallel, then all the  straight lines that meet a, band care Cr (Ct-) parallel. Consequently,  any three Ct-(Cr) parallel lines define a ruled surface in elliptic  3-space. Such a surface is called a Clifford surface. Let I denote a  Clifford surface. It can be proved that I is a surface of revolution  with two axes. I is closed and has a finite area. It is not difficult to  see that I has a constant Gaussian curvature equal to 0: Any pair of  CI-parallels a, b on I will meet a pair of C2-parallels r, s on I at right  angles; a, b, c, d form a rectangular quadrilateral with equal opposite  sides. Such a quadrilateral can exist only on a surface of zero  G-curvature.64 It follows that every connected proper subset of I can  be mapped isometrically into the Euclidean plane.  The discovery of Clifford surfaces immediately suggests the  following problem: To determine all the globally non-homeomorphic  surfaces in elliptic, parabolic and hyperbolic 3-space which are locally  isometric to the Euclidean (or to the elliptic or to the hyperbolic)  plane. The problem, when generalized to hypersurfaces in elliptic,  parabolic and hyperbolic space of any dimension number, is known as  the Clifford-Klein problem of space-forms. The question can be  approached also from an 'intrinsic' point of view, that is, without  paying heed to the particular structure of the embedding space. Thus,  we may ask for all the types of globally non-homeomorphic n­ dimensional Riemannian manifolds of zero curvature, all of which, as  we know, are locally isometric to Rn (with the standard Euclidean  metric). Each of these types is said to be an n-dimensional Euclidean  space-form. The case n = 3 is philosophically interesting. It can be  shown that there are seventeen distinct families plus a one-parameter  family (i.e. a family of families, indexed by R) of Riemannian mani­ folds such that (i) any member of one of the families is locally  isometric with Euclidean 3-space; (ii) two members of the same  family are globally diffeomorphic; but (iii) no member of one family  can be mapped diffeomorphically onto a member of another family.  Ten of the families are topologically compact, so that the spaces  belonging to them can be said to have a finite volume.65 Let us assume  for a moment that men actually have -as Kant taught in 1770 -an a  priori intuition of space which requires them to ascribe to it a  Euclidean metric. Since we cannot visualize the whole of space, our a </p><div id="pagenum"><p>priori intuition would not enable us to decide whether it is actually an </p></div><div id="pagenum"><p>152 CHAPTER 2 </p></div><p id="page">infinite space or whether it belongs to one of the ten families of  compact spaces that are locally isometric to R3. This indeterminacy is,  in a sense, built into the concept of an a priori intuition of Euclidean  space. Analogous remarks apply to empirically based spatial in­ tuitions. Commenting on such matters, Klein wrote in 1897:  Our empirical measurements have an upper bound, given by the size of the objects  which are accessible to us or which fall under our observation. What do we know about  spatial relations in the very large (im Unmessbar-Grossen)? Absolutely nothing, to  begin with. We can only resort to postulates. Hence I regard all the topologically  different space-forms as equally compatible with experience.66  The choice between these forms, Klein adds, should be guided by the  principle of economy of thought. In his lectures on non-Euclidean  geometry, published posthumously thirty years later, he remarks:  Let us assume that the space about us exhibits a Euclidean or a hyperbolic structure.  We can by no means infer from this that space has an infinite extent. Because, for  instance, Euclidean geometry is entirely compatible with the hypothesis that space is  finite, a fact that has been formerly overlooked. The possibility of ascribing a finite  content to space whatever its geometrical structure, is particularly welcome because  the idea of an infinite expanse, which was originaliy looked upon as a substantial  progress of the human mind, gives rise to many difficulties, e.g. in connexion with the  problem of mass-distribution'"  We see thus that towards the end of his life, probably after studying  Einstein's writings on gravitation and cosmology, Klein came to think  that cosmological considerations can furnish empirical criteria for  choosing between globally non-homeomorphic though locally </p><div id="pagenum"><p>isometric space-forms. </p></div><div id="pagenum"><p>CHAPTER 3 </p></div><p id="page">FOUNDATIONS  Plato held that specialized knowledge becomes true science only if  one is aware of its foundations. To inquire into these, however, was  not a task for the specialist but for the dialectician, whom we would  call the philosopher. Yet philosophers from Plato to Kant have not  contributed much to our awareness of the foundations of geometry.  Some of them did discuss the nature of geometrical objects and the  source of geometrical knowledge, but they were content to accept the  principles of geometry proposed by Euclid, and they rarely went into  details concerning, say, the justification of this or that particular  principle or the relationship between the principles and the body of  geometrical propositions. Shortly after 1800, G.W.F. Hegel claimed  that mathematical axioms, insofar as they are not mere tautologies,  ought to be proved in a philosophical science, prior to mathematics.  Euclid, said Hegel, was right not to attempt a demonstration of  Postulate 5, for such a demonstration can only be based on the  concept of parallel lines and therefore pertains to philosophy, not to  geometry. 1 However Hegel himself did not provide the demon­ stration.  In 1851 Friedrich Ueberweg, a young German philosopher, pub­ lished an essay on The principles of geometry, scientifically expoun­ ded. The purpose of this work is to show how the propositions of  geometry can be derived by logical means from a few empirically  obvious truths. With this aim in mind, Ueberweg tries to build  Euclid's system on a novel set of axioms, centred upon the concept of  rigid motion. Another philosopher, the Belgian, J. Delboeuf, a pupil  and friend of Ueberweg, published nine years later a different recon­ struction of Euclidean geometry, based on the principle that shape  cannot depend on size. Delboeuf was probably the earliest philoso­ phical writer who had first-hand acquaintance with the works of  Lobachevsky. He describes BL geometry as "une science enchainee  quoique fausse", and he mentions it to illustrate the fact that false  premises need not imply inconsistent conclusions.2  The first works on the foundations of geometry responsive to the </p><div id="pagenum"><p>153 </p></div><div id="pagenum"><p>154 CHAPTER 3 </p></div><p id="page">full impact of the new geometries did not appear until the late 1860's,  the most important being Riemann's lecture of 1854 (published in  1867) and three papers of Hermann von Helmholtz (1866, 1868, 1870),  who was not a mathematician, nor a professional philosopher, but a  physician -and a great physicist -with a philosophical turn of mind.  These works may be regarded as the starting-point of a series of  investigations of an increasingly mathematical character that even­ tually culminated in David Hilbert's Foundations of Geometry (1899).  Among the publications on the subject which appeared between  Helmholtz's and Hilbert's the most remarkable are perhaps two  papers by Sophus Lie, "On the foundations of geometry" (1890),  reworked and expanded in Part V of the third volume of his Theory  of Transformation Groups (1893). Lie's approach stems directly from  Helmholtz's. His aim is to give an exact solution of the latter's  "problem of space", originally conceived as a typical epistemological  question which may be stated thus: Which among the infinitely many  geometries whose mathematical viability has been shown by Rie­ mann's theory of manifolds are compatible with the general condi­ tions of possibility of physical measurement? Implicit in the question  is the operationist belief that only such geometries as are compatible  with the latter conditions are suitable for the role of a physical  geometry. We shall discuss this problem in Part 3.1.  We shall see that Lie, while correcting and improving Helmholtz's  mathematical treatment of the problem of space, lost sight of its  epistemological significance and understood it as a problem in pure  mathematics, viz. What properties are necessary and sufficient to  define Euclidean geometry and its near relatives, the geometries of  constant non-zero curvature? Lie's answer to this modified question  anticipates Hilbert's achievement, insofar as it gives an exact  axiomatic characterization of Euclidean geometry. But Hilbert's ap­ proach is very different from Lie's. Like Riemann and Helmholtz, Lie  conceives of space as a differentiable manifold, whose local topology  depends on the familiar, tacitly assumed properties of the real number  continuum (its global topology, he simply ignores). Hilbert, on the  other hand, makes no prior assumptions concerning the relation  between geometry and analysis. As a matter of fact, the first version  of his axiom system does not even ensure that space can be endowed  with a differentiable structure.3 And he makes a point of showing how </p><div id="pagenum"><p>unexpectedly far one can proceed ir.. the construction of Euclidean </p></div><div id="pagenum"><p>FOUNDATIONS 155 </p></div><p id="page">geometry without using the Archimedean postulate that every seg­ ment is less than a multiple of a given segment, which is apparently a  prerequisite of analytic geometry. Hilbert, whose style recalls Greek  geometry at its best, disentangles the simplest conditions that deter­ mine the structure of Euclidean space and shows how the various  aspects of that structure depend on one or the other of those  conditions. Hilbert's book was preceded by Pasch's Lectures on  Modem Geometry (1882) and the axiomatizations of Peano (1889,  1894) and other mathematicians of the Italian school. Its impact upon  the methodology of mathematics and the philosophical interpretation  of the nature of mathematical knowledge has been immense. The  background and significance of Hilbert's book are the subject of Part  3.2.  3.1 HELMHOLTZ'S PROBLEM OF SPACE  3.1.1 Helmholtz and Riemann  The writings of Hermann von Helmholtz (1821-1894) on the foun­ dations of geometry are few and short, but they have exerted an  enormous influence. His solution of the Helmholtz problem of space  was reported in a paper "On the factual foundations of geometry"  (1866) and presented with proofs in a second paper "On the facts  which lie at the foundation of geometry" (1868). His conclusions are  marred by the fact that he ignored BL geometry. Apparently, he  learnt about it from Beltrami's "Saggio" (1868) and "Teoria  fondamentale degli spazii di curvatura costante" (1868/69). A note  correcting his omission appeared in 1869 in the same journal that  published the paper of 1866. His well-known lecture "On the origin  and significance of geometrical axioms" (1870) states his final solution  of the space problem and draws philosophical conclusions from it.  We shall see that this lecture not only provides almost all the material  for the philosophical debate on geometry during the last third of the  19th century, but contains the germ of several important epistemolo­ gical ideas which have been very influential in the 20th century.  Helmholtz says that his investigations concerning the localization  of perceived objects in the visual field led him to study the origin and  nature of our common intuitive representations of space. In this </p><div id="pagenum"><p>connection, he met one question whose answer, he believes, pertains </p></div><div id="pagenum"><p>156 CHAPTER 3 </p></div><p id="page">also to exact science, namely "which propositions of geometry  express truths of factual significance and which are merely definitions  or a consequence of definitions and of the chosen mode of expres­ sion?"l Helmholtz's question asks, essentially, for the foundations  of geometry, regarded as a science of physical space. He says that in  his investigation of the problem he followed a path not too distant  from the one pursued by Riemann, with whose lecture "Ueber die  Hypothesen" he became acquainted later. There is however an  essential difference between him and Riemann, which Helmholtz  emphasized in the very title of his second paper: "On the facts  [instead of the hypotheses] which lie at the foundation of geometry".  In Riemann's theory only the most general principle of physical  geometry, stating that space is what Riemann called a "manifold",  passes for an a priori principle that follows directly from the concept  of extendedness or spatiality. The specification of this "manifold" as  a continuous one and the remaining principles of geometry are  hypotheses, which Riemann also describes as "facts" (Tatsachen)/  because they can be confirmed or refuted by experience, but which,  like all scientific hypotheses, never can attain full precision and  certainty. There is one exception: because of its peculiar nature, the  number of dimensions of physical space, though factual, is known  exactly with almost unimpeachable certainty, through simple, famil­ iar, prescientific experiences.3 But all the other fundamental principles  of geometry are valid only approximately, within the limits of obser­ vation, and are subject to revision. Moreover they share with the  newest hypotheses of mid-19th-century physics one rather disquieting  trait: they involve highly complex and seemingly abstruse conceptual  constructions, the adequacy of which can only be determined in­ directly, through the empirical test of particular, often remote  consequences. Thus, Euclidean geometry is characterized by three  hypotheses, which, together with the two principles we have already  mentioned, may be regarded as Riemann's axioms for this geometry:  (RI) Space is a differentiable manifold.  (R2) Space has three dimensions.  (R3) The element of length is given by the square root of a  quadratic differential expression ~ gmn dxm dxn, where the gmn denote  differentiable functions of the coordinates Xl, x2, x3, with non-singular </p><div id="pagenum"><p>matrix [gmn]. </p></div><div id="pagenum"><p>FOUNDATIONS 157 </p></div><p id="page">(R4) The curvature of space is constant.  (R5) Space is flat, i.e. its curvature is everywhere equal to zero. 4  Helmholtz readily accepted this characterization, but he apparently  felt that such a fundamental science as geometry, which lies at the  very basis of mechanics and the other physical sciences, ought not to  rest upon an uncertain hypothetical foundation which is indirectly and  only approximately verifiable. He was therefore very happy to find  oUt that R3 and R4 are logical consequences of a "fact of obser­ vation", as familiar and indisputable as, say, the fact that space is  three-dimensional: "the observed fact that the movement of rigid  figures is possible in our space, with the degree of freedom that we  know" ,5 so that the congruence of bodily figures is independent "of  place, of the direction of the coincident figures, and of the path over  which they have been brought into coincidence".6 As to Axiom R5,  Helmholtz mistakenly believed, until Beltrami disabused him, that it  follows from another, not quite so obvious fact, which was generally  accepted at that time; namely, that space is infinite.6a  Riemann himself had pointed out that R4 follows from the assump­ tion that the shape and size of bodies do not depend upon their  position or their movements in space. He backed this statement, not  with a strict mathematical proof, but with good plausible arguments.7  Helmholtz was content to accept them. His contribution consisted in  showing that the more general Riemannian hypothesis R3 can also be  inferred from this assumption. He believes that the epistemological  significance of this result is considerable because the very possibility  of physical geometry rests upon the existence of rigid bodies that can  be transported everywhere, undeformed. If this condition were not  fulfilled, no spatial measurement could be performed, for the possi­ bility of actual physical measurement does not only require -as  Riemann thought -that the length of lines be independent of how  they lie in space, but also that the size and shape of bodies remain  unaltered, while they rotate or travel in any way whatsoever.8 A  mathematical theory of space which does not make allowance for the  possibility of measurement does not deserve the name of geometry,  since no metrein, no measuring, can be performed within its frame­ work. If Helmholtz is right, there are no more geometries than those  which agree with Axioms RI-R4, that is, the Riemannian geometries </p><div id="pagenum"><p>of constant curvature. The vast array of manifolds, both Riemannian </p></div><div id="pagenum"><p>158 CHAPTER 3 </p></div><p id="page">and non-Riemannian, which Riemann's lecture had opened to  exploration, are not then a proper subject for geometry, but merely  the field of some abstruse jeu d' esprit, or at best, perhaps, an auxiliary  branch of mathematical analysis.  3.1.2 The Facts which Lie at the Foundation of Geometry  In order to demonstrate R3, Helmholtz analyses the fundamental fact  of the existence of rigid bodies and states its necessary conditions in  the form of axioms. They are preceded by a restatement of Rl, which  provides the groundwork for the whole argument. This is carried out  for the 3-dimensional case only. Helmholtz's axioms read ap­ proximately as follows:  (HI) Space is an n-fold extended manifold, that is, each point in  space can be determined by measurement of n arbitrary, continuously  and independently variable quantities (coordinates).  (H2) There exist in space movable point-systems, called rigid  bodies, which fulfil the following condition: the 2n coordinates of  every point-pair in the system are related by an equation which is  independent of the movement of the system and is the same for all  congruent point-pairs. (Two point-pairs are congruent if they can be  made to coincide, simultaneously or successively, with the same pair  of points in space).  (H3) (a) Rigid bodies can move freely, that is, any point in such a  body can be carried continuously to the position of any other point in  space, provided that this movement is compatible with the equations  that relate its coordinates to those of the other points of the body. (b)  Any point in a rigid body may be regarded as absolutely movable; if  this point is fixed, i.e. if its coordinates do not change, any other point  is tied to it by an equation and one of the coordinates of the latter  becomes a function of the remaining n -1 coordinates; if two points  are fixed, any third point is tied by two equations, etc. Generally  speaking, therefore, the position of a rigid body depends on n(n + 1)/2  quantities.  (H4) When a solid body rotates about n -1 points belonging to it,  and these are chosen so that the position of the body depends only on  a single independent variable, rotation without reversal eventually  carries the body back to its initial position. (,Rotation of a body  about k points belonging to it' means movement of the body while </p><div id="pagenum"><p>those k points remain fixed; a movement is said to be reversed if the </p></div><div id="pagenum"><p>FOUNDATIONS 159 </p></div><p id="page">coordinates of every point retake successively, in reverse order, the  same values they had taken before.)  HI implies that the movement of a point is attended by a continu­ ous change of one or more of its coordinates. Helmholtz remarks that  continuity, in this case, does not mean only that the coordinates will  take all values between two extremes, but also that the quotient of the  correlative variations of two coordinates changing together will ap­ proach a limit as those variations decrease. Helmholtz is apparently  aware of Weierstrass' discovery of a nowhere differentiable continu­ ous function, and he reacts by explicitly narrowing down the meaning  of continuity so that it implies differentiability. It seems clear that by  a value of a variable quantity we must here understand a real number.  Since Helmholtz considers spherical geometry as one of the  geometries compatible with his first axiom (indeed, with all four), this  axiom cannot mean that a single coordinate system (a single chart, as  we would say now) covers the whole of space. I take it therefore that  Helmholtz's HI (like Riemann's Rl) really says that space is an  n-dimensional differentiable manifold.  H2 postulates the existence of rigid bodies. These are defined as  movable systems of spatial points which fulfil a specified condition in  pairs. Two point-pairs fulfilling the same condition are said to be  congruent. I understand that these point-systems consist of any  number of points of general position in space (i.e. such that their  respective coordinates do not all satisfy a given system of n linear  equations, or some other restrictive condition of this kind). This  interpretation of rigid bodies as point-systems may be thought to aim  at dephysicalizing the concept of a body, and thereby adapting it to its  new role as a fundamental concept in pure geometry. But then we  should dephysicalize the concept of movement as well. It does not  make much sense to speak of transporting an immaterial point from  one place to another. One usually grapples with this difficulty by  resorting to the concept of a mapping. An injective mapping of a  region of space onto another does not actually move the points of the  former into coincidence with the latter, but it defines a one-to-one  correspondence between points which bears an analogy to the rela­ tion between the initial and the final positions of a moving body. If we  represent bodies by immaterial point-systems, we may as well  represent movements by injective mappings. Let K be a point-system </p><div id="pagenum"><p>representing a body k at rest in space S; if f: K ~ S is an injective </p></div><div id="pagenum"><p>160 CHAPTER 3 </p></div><p id="page">mapping which preserves congruence, then I(K) represents k in the  position attained after a movement represented by I. Of course, 1  represents equally well any movement which carries k from K to  f(K). But then, all these movements are equivalent for the geometer,  who only heeds the size and shape of the body before and after the  movement. The condition on point-pairs stated in H2 can now be read  as a restriction imposed on injective mappings. An injection f: K -+ S  represents a movement of k from position K if, and only if, f  preserves a given function g defined on S x S, that is, if for every P,  Q in K, g(P, Q) = g(/(P), f(Q». If f1: K -+ Sand 12: ft(K) -+ S are  injections which preserve g, h . f1 represents a movement of k from  K to h(/)(K». This suggests a bolder approach to the representation  of movements by means of mappings. Let t be a transformation of S  (Section 2.3.8). If t preserves g, the restriction of t to K represents a  movement of k from K. Since K is arbitrary, we may forget about it,  and consider t itself as the representative of every movement of an  arbitrary body k, from any given position K to t(K). We call such a  transformation a motion of S. It is readily seen that the set of motions  of S is a transformation group. This conception is the basis of Lie's  treatment of Helmholtz's problem (Section 3.1.4). Helmholtz's own  proof of R3 suggests that the said conception was not altogether  foreign to him, but we cannot be sure that he actually had thought of  it. In fact, I do not believe that the dephysicalization apparently  aimed at by H2 was ever seriously meant by Helmholtz. He regarded  geometry as essentially oriented towards its physical and technical  applications. This determines the fundamental conditions H2-H4  which he required every geometry to fulfil. He wrote that "the axioms  of geometry do not speak about spatial relations only, but also at the  same time about the mechanical behaviour of our most rigid bodies in  motion".9 We might not be too far off the mark, therefore, if we say  that Helmholtz did not expect his movable rigid point-systems to be  altogether immaterial, but that he conceived them as entities of an  unspecified materiality, like the mass-points mentioned in mechanical  treatises.  We have divided H3 into two parts, marked (a) and (b). Helmholtz  seems to consider (b) merely as a consequence or explanation of (a),  for he does not italicize it, as he does (a), and he uses in the first  sentence of (b) the word therefore (in German: also). We shall see </p><div id="pagenum"><p>later that (b) adds, in fact, a new and significant condition to H3(a). </p></div><div id="pagenum"><p>FOUNDATIONS 161 </p></div><p id="page">This will be better understood when we come to speak of Lie's  criticism of Helmholtz.1o  H4 is called the axiom of monodromy. It says that the rotation of  an n-dimensional rigid body about n -1 fixed points belonging to it, if  continued long enough in the same sense, takes every point in the  body back to its initial position. We normally regard it as intuitively  obvious in the case of a body in three-dimensional Euclidean space  rotating about two fixed points. The intuitive idea of continuous  movement is given a strict mathematical interpretation within the  framework of Lie's theory. But Lie shows, on the other hand, that the  axiom of monodromy is superfluous: R3 and R4 can be derived from  HI-H3 alone, on a suitable interpretation of axioms H2 and H3; but  they cannot be derived from HI-H4 if H2 and H3 are not given this  interpretation. In Helmholtz's reasoning, however, H4 plays an  essential role.  Helmholtz's argument, as we said above, depends also on a fifth  axiom:  (H5) Space has three dimensions.  This is mentioned explicitly at the outset. \I Helmholtz goes on to say  that, since his proof aims at establishing Riemann's Axiom R3, which  is concerned with the differentials of the coordinates, he will apply  H2-H4 only to points whose respective coordinates differ infinitesi­ mally. He apparently thinks that he will thereby weaken his assump­ tions, since he need not extend them to bodies of any arbitrary size.12  But Lie will show that he has radically changed them, since the  assumption that H2-H4 apply to infinitesimal displacements neither  implies nor is implied by the statement that these axioms apply to  finite movements. From a logical point of view, this does not really  matter, for we may take Helmholtz's remark as actually fixing the  intended scope of his axioms, and there is then nothing essentially  wrong about his proof. However, the matter is not epistemologically  indifferent, because the validity of the axioms in the infinitesimal  cannot be established by empirical observation, except indirectly,  through the verification of their consequences. Hence, if we must  assume that they are true of infinitesimal displacements (instead of  if}ierring it from the fact that they are true of finite displacements),  the axioms will not provide a factual foundation of geometry, in  Helmholtz's sense, but will behave as mere hypotheses like </p><div id="pagenum"><p>Riemann's axioms. </p></div><div id="pagenum"><p>162 CHAPTER 3 </p></div><p id="page">We need not go into the details of Helmholtz's argument. Axiom  HI ensures the applicability of mathematical analysis. H3 is quite  essential, for the proof depends mainly on the consideration of  infinitesimal rotations about three concurrent axes (or rather, about  three linearly independent tangent vectors at a point). H4 is used for  proving that the solution of a certain system of differential equations  must be a periodic function (and that, consequently, a parameter  which appears in that solution can only take imaginary values). The  conclusion is that a certain quadratic expression in the coordinate  differentials remains unchanged "in all rotations of the system" about  a given point. \3 "This quantity -says Helmholtz -can therefore be  used as a measure, independent of the rotational movements, of the spa­ tial difference between the points (r, s, t) and (r + dr, s + ds, t + dt).,,14  After thus inferring R3 from his axioms, Helmholtz accepts, on the  strength of Riemann's plausible reasons, that R4 also follows from  them. Helmholtz concludes in 1866 and 1868 that the only possible  geometries are the spherical geometry of positive constant curvature  and the Euclidean geometry of zero curvature. Consequently, "if we  postulate the infinite extension of space, no geometry is possible  except the one Euclid taught" .IS Helmholtz either overlooks the possi­ bility of a space with constant negative curvature (which Riemann  had mentioned in passing), or mistakenly assumes that such a  space must be finite. This error was corrected by him in a short note,  published on April 30, 1869, which, as we mentioned above, refers to  two papers by Beltrami. In their original formulation, Helmholtz's  papers of 1866 and 1868 must have sounded to non-mathematicians as  a proof that Euclidean geometry is solidly founded on facts, for the  infinity of space was a commonplace of contemporary astronomy.  This conclusion, however, could have been questioned even in terms  of those two papers alone, without invoking BL geometry. Because if  we admit, as Helmholtz does, the possibility of a three-dimensional  spherical geometry, space can be unlimited without being infinite  (Riemann, as we may recall, had made this plain). But if this is so,  there is really no reason for maintaining that space is infinite -unless,  of course, we know on other grounds that it is Euclidean (or BL).  3.1.3 Helmholtz's Philosophy of Geometry  Helmholtz's final solution of his problem of space may be stated thus:  Space is a three-dimensional R-manifold with constant curvature. </p><div id="pagenum"><p>The solution rests on three premises: (a) Space is an n-dimensional </p></div><div id="pagenum"><p>FOUNDATIONS 163 </p></div><p id="page">differentiable manifold; (b) n = 3; (c) rigid bodies exist. Premise (a) is  apparently regarded by Helmholtz as analytic, i.e. as an explanation  of the meaning of the word space. It does not lack factual contents,  however, insofar as it states (or implies) that such a space exists.  Premise (b) is treated by Helmholtz as stating a universal trait of  human experience, a sort of factual a priori. Premise (c) is repeatedly  described by him as a fact, though, as we shall see, it would be a fact  of a rather peculiar sort. The stated solution opens three main  alternatives: Space is either (i) a spherical space or (ii) a Euclidean  space or (iii) a BL space. Alternatives (i) and (iii) comprise, in fact, a  continuous spectrum of possibilities, depending on the exact value of  space curvature; but Helmholtz does not discuss this side of the  matter. A decision between alternative (i) and the other two could be  empirically reached if we could test the statement that space has a  finite extension. But it does not seem possible to choose, on purely  geometric grounds, between alternatives (ii) and (iii).  We gather these results from Helmholtz's lecture of 1870, "On the  origin and significance of geometric axioms". This is mainly intended  to present the discoveries of Bolyai, Lobachevsky, Gauss, Riemann  and of Helmholtz himself, as a scientific basis for an empiricist  philosophy of geometry, directly opposed to Kant's apriorism. But it  also contains what is perhaps the first statement of a conventionalist  position in this field (restricted, however, to a choice of two  geometries). Finally, insofar as the factual foundation of geometry,  according to the empiricist philosophy of Helmholtz, is, as we said, a  peculiar fact, which is viewed as a condition of the very possibility of  geometrical knowledge, Helmholtz can be regarded as paving the way  for a new brand of apriorism, developed in our century by Hugo  Dingler (1881-1954).  Helmholtz's researches on auditive and visual perception persuaded  him that sensory stimuli only supply signs of the presence of the  objects surrounding us, but do not give us a passably adequate idea of  such objects. Such signs, in themselves quite devoid of sense, acquire  a meaning by virtue of which they become a vehicle of knowledge,  through a long process of association and comparison, beginning in  the earliest days of childhood. This constitutes the foundation of  inductive inferences, which eventually become so habitual, that they  are automatically and instantly performed. Helmholtz's conception of  perceptual knowledge is not too different from Kant's, who spoke of </p><div id="pagenum"><p>"spelling out sensory appearances, in order to read them as </p></div><div id="pagenum"><p>164 CHAPTER 3 </p></div><p id="page">experience" .16 But Kant thought that geometrical knowledge, i.e.  knowledge of the spatial structure to which all things around us must  conform, is not acquired in this fashion, but is based on an immediate  awareness of space which accompanies all our perceptions of spatial  things but is not determined by them. Kant described this awareness  as a kind of self-knowledge, viz. our intuitive (i.e. non-mediated and  non-generic) knowledge of the 'form' of outer sense. This Helmholtz  rejects. The science of geometry contains a vast -and ever growing­ array of truths which can be inferred by purely logical means from a  few principles or axioms. These axioms, in their turn, do not express  the content of a non-empirical awareness of the structure of space,  but like everything else we know about the material world in which  we live, they are learnt through the processes of manipulation and  observation, guided by intelligent comparison and inference, which  Helmholtz, like Kant, calls experience. The existence of alternative  consistent systems of geometrical axioms has probably contributed to  suggest this empiricist thesis. A professional natural scientist like  Helmholtz, if faced by several equally rational theories that purpor­ tedly concern the same subject-matter, will feel inclined to judge that  only experience can decide between them. But such feelings are not a  rational ground of belief. A truly powerful argument for Helmholtz's  geometrical empiricism is provided by his own discovery that the  existence of rigid bodies, reputedly "a fact of observation", goes a  long way to determine the structure of space.  Like most scholars of his time, Helmholtz believed that Kant's  claim that geometrical knowledge is non-empirical rests on the alleged  fact that we can only visualize (anschaulich vorstellen) spatial rela­ tions which agree with Euclid's geometry. By visualization, we must  understand here that kind of imaginative representation of spatial  figures which we all have had while attempting to solve a problem in  elementary geometry with closed eyes. Helmholtz attacks this  supposedly Kantian position from two sides. In the first place, in  order to establish the unavoidability of the Euclidean axioms, the  inner visualization ought to be absolutely exact. "Otherwise we could  not say whether two straight lines prolonged to infinity will intersect  once only or twice, or whether every straight line that cuts one of two  parallels must also cut the other lying in the same plane. Imperfect  ocular estimates cannot pass for the transcendental intuition, since </p><div id="pagenum"><p>the latter demands absolute precision (man muss nicht das so un-</p></div><div id="pagenum"><p>FOUNDATIONS 165 </p></div><p id="page">vollkommene Augenmass jur die transcendentale Anschauung un­ terschieben wollen, welche letztere absolute Genauigkeit jorden)."l7 It  goes without saying that our images of geometrical objects lack such  precision, especially with regard to their metrical properties. In the  second place, we are actually able to visualize the state of affairs in a  non-Euclidean space. This is not easy, but it is not very much harder  than visualizing, say, all the loops of a thread tied in a difficult knot,  or the plan of a labyrinthic building which we have just finished  visiting. The important thing is to understand rightly what it means to  visualize a state of affairs we have never met in actual experience.  "By the much abused expression 'to visualize' (sich vorstellen) or 'to  be able to figure out how something happens', I understand -and I do  not see how anything else can be understood without it losing all  meaning -the power of imagining the whole series of sensible im­ pressions that would be had in such a case."lS Helmholtz proposes  several examples of visualization of non-Euclidean situations which  were probably suggested by his experiments with distorting eye­ glasses. One of them anticipates Lewis Carroll's Through the Looking­ glass. A convex mirror maps an open region of ordinary space into an  imaginary space where bodies behave in a most remarkable fashion.  The mapping is injective, and every straight line and every plane in  the outer world is represented by a line and a surface in the image.  The image of a man measuring with a rule a straight line from the mirror would  contract more and more the farther he went, but with his shrunken rule the man in the  image would count out exactly the same number of centimetres as the real man. And, in  general, all geometrical measurements of lines or angles made with regularly varying  images of real instruments would yield exactly the same results as in the outer world,  all congruent bodies would coincide on being applied to one another in the mirror as in the  outer world, all lines of sight in the outer world would be represented by straight lines of  sight in the mirror. In short, I do not see how men in the mirror are to discover that their  bodies are not rigid solids and their experiences good examples of the correctness of  Euclid's axioms. But if they could look out upon our world as we can look into theirs,  without overstepping the boundary, they must declare it to be a picture in a spherical  mirror, and would speak of us just as we speak of them; and if two inhabitants of the  different worlds could communicate with one another, neither, so far as I can see, would be  able to convince the other that he had the true, the other the distorted, relations.'9  A second example shows that something similar may be said of BL  space (which Helmholtz calls pseudospherical space), as represented  in the interior of a Euclidean sphere (Section 2.3.7). Beltrami's </p><div id="pagenum"><p>mathematical description of this model enables us to predict exactly </p></div><div id="pagenum"><p>166 CHAPTER 3 </p></div><p id="page">what an observer placed in the centre of it would see. In agreement  with the above definition of 'to visualize', Helmholtz concludes: "We  can picture to ourselves the look of a pseudospherical world in all  directions, just as we can develop the concept of it".20  But the fact that the axioms of geometry are not known a priori  does not imply, in Helmholtz's opinion, that we do not have an  intuitive, non-empirical awareness of spatiality as such. Indeed,  "Kant's theory of the forms of intuition given a priori is a very clear  and happy expression of the state of affairs; but these forms must  actually be so empty and free (inhaltsleer und {rei) that they might  receive every contents which can make its appearance in the cor­ responding form of perception".21 How does Helmholtz conceive  space as an a priori 'form of sense'? To make himself clear, he  proposes an analogy: it lies in the nature of our visual faculty that we  must see everything in the guise of colours spread out in space. "This  is the innate form of our visual perceptions. ,,22 But this does not in  any way determine how the colours that we actually see lie beside  one another or how they succeed each other. Likewise, the represen­ tation of all external objects in spatial relations might be the form  given a priori in which alone we can represent such objects; but this  does not imply that certain spatial perceptions must go together, e.g.  that if a triangle is equilateral its angles must be equal to 7Tt3.  Helmholtz emphasizes that the general form of extendedness that we  may regard as given a priori must be quite indeterminate. This cannot  mean, however, that it has no determinations at all. Shall we maintain,  as suggested by Schlick, that its determinations are indescribable,  like, say, the difference between sweet and bitter?23 There is one  passage which clearly implies that at least the dimension number is a  definite property of the general form of our outer sense (as under­ stood by Helmholtz).24 Since the number of dimensions of space is  conceived by him in connection with its manifold structure, consis­ tency requires that we also regard this structure as included in the  general form of extendedness.25 This does not mean, of course, that  the mathematical notion of a differentiable manifold is known to  infants. But it must mean, if it means anything, that the said notion  arises from our attempt at intellectually dissecting and recomposing a  natural idea of space we have always been familiar with. If this is  right, the properties of pure space can be stated in axioms; indeed </p><div id="pagenum"><p>they have been so stated by Helmholtz himself (in H1). But they are </p></div><div id="pagenum"><p>FOUNDATIONS 167 </p></div><p id="page">not mentioned in the traditional axioms of geometry, which are what  Helmholtz has in mind when he says that the axioms are empirical.  Such axioms, he says, do not belong to the pure theory of space for  they speak of quantities. But "we can speak of quantities only if we  know of some way by which we can compare, divide and measure  them. All space-measurements, and, therefore, in general, all quan­ titative concepts applied to space, assume the possibility of figures  moving without change of form or size".26 We have experienced the  existence of such figures since our earliest youth. But it does not  follow from the pure idea of space. Helmholtz recalls that Riemann  had shown that such figures can only exist in an R-manifold of  constant curvature.27 His own mathematical researches, as we saw in  Section 3.1.2, have allegedly shown that the existence of rigid figures  suffices to determine the geometry of a manifold up to a parameter  (the constant Riemannian curvature). In this sense, and if we grant his  operationist premise, Helmholtz may be right in claiming that  geometry rests on a factual foundation. But the fact upon which it is  said to rest is a very special fact. Strictly speaking, there are no  absolutely rigid bodies. Every solid piece of matter is liable to suffer  deformations under the influence of heat, gravitation, etc. Two  congruent bodies moved about for some time along different paths  will no longer fit exactly into the same mould. How can we analyze  the physical causes acting on our bodies so that we may conclude that  the deformation of the latter is not caused just by their displacement?  Helmholtz was well aware of this difficulty. Mter introducing his  basic question "What propositions of geometry express factually  significant truths?" he adds:  It is not easy to answer this question [ ... J because the spatial figures of geometry are  ideals to which the bodily figures of the real world can only approximate, without ever  satisfying all the requirements of the concept, and because we must judge the  permanence of shape, the flatness of the planes and the straightness of the lines we find  in a solid body, precisely by means of the same geometrical propositions we wished to  prove factually in this particular case.28  The fact that (approximately) rigid bodies exist can only be known,  therefore, if we possess the idea of a (perfectly) rigid body. Bearing  this in mind, Helmholtz acknowledges that "the notion of a rigid  geometrical figure may be conceived indeed as a transcendental  notion, which has been formed independently of actual experiences, </p><div id="pagenum"><p>and which will not necessarily correspond with them".29 He adds: </p></div><div id="pagenum"><p>168 CHAPTER 3 </p></div><p id="page">Taking the notion of rigidity thus as a mere ideal, a strict Kantian might certainly look  upon the geometrical axioms as propositions given a priori by transcendental intuition,  which no experience could either confirm or refute, because it must first be decided by  them whether any natural bodies can be considered as rigid. But then we should have  to maintain that the axioms of geometry are not synthetic propositions in Kant's sense,  because they would state only what follows analytically from the notion of a rigid  geometrical figure, as it is required for measurement. Only such figures as satisfy those  axioms could be acknowledged as rigid figures.30  The reference to a transcendental intuition is probably ironic/1 but  Helmholtz's claim in this passage is perfectly serious and very im­ portant. It clearly anticipates the familiar epistemological conception  of scientific notions and theories as free creations of the human mind,  which are not originated in experience but must be tested by it. But  the notion we are concerned with here is not an ordinary scientific  notion. According to Helmholtz, if the facts fail to satisfy it, spatial  measurement will turn out to be impossible. Consequently, a whole  field of experience, which provides the basis for physical science, will  fail to exist. The notion of a rigid body must therefore be regarded, if  Helmholtz is right, as a concept constitutive of physical experience,  that is, as a transcendental concept in the proper Kantian sense. And  experience, at least objective, scientific, measurement-controlled  experience, cannot but conform to it. Helmholtz stands therefore  nearer to Kant than it seems at first sight. There is one big novelty,  however. The role of the concept of a rigid body in the constitution of  scientific experience does not consist in presiding, like a Kantian  category, a purely mental process of organization of sense-data; but  in regulating the manufacture and use of material instruments of  measurement. This idea will be taken up and worked out by Hugo  Dingler.  A space which contains perfectly rigid bodies is an R-manifold of  constant curvature. Will experience allow us to decide between the  different alternatives contained in this notion? A positive curvature is  excluded if space is not finite. But even granting that it is infinite, we  still have the choice between Euclidean and BL geometry. Let us  hear what Helmholtz has to say about this:  We have no other mark of rigidity of bodies or figures but the congruences they  continue to show whenever they are applied to one another at any time or place and after  any rotation. We cannot however decide by pure geometry [ ... J whether the coinciding </p><div id="pagenum"><p>bodies may not both have varied in the same sense. If we judged it useful for any </p></div><div id="pagenum"><p>FOUNDATIONS 169 </p></div><p id="page">purpose we might with perfect consistency look upon the space in which we live as the  apparent space behind a convex mirror [ ... J; or we might consider a bounded sphere of  our space, beyond the limits of which we perceive nothing further, as infinite pseudo­ spherical space. Only then we should have to ascribe to the bodies which appear to us to  be rigid, and to our own body, corresponding dilatations and contractions and we  should have to change our system of mechanical principles entirely.32  On the face of it, this passage says that the choice between Euclidean  and BL geometry is a matter of convenience, so that, at least within  this limited spectrum of alternatives, geometry is conventional. In  terms of Helmholtz's original question, this conclusion can be stated  saying that Euclid's fifth postulate is not a "truth of factual  significance" but a consequence of the chosen mode of expression.  This position was held later by Henri Poincare (1854-1912).33 Did  Helmholtz anticipate him? I would say yes, insofar as he did publish  the passage quoted above, which clearly suggests the conventionalist  thesis. But it is apparent that Helmholtz did not understand his words  quite in that sense. He points out that a change in the geometry would  impose a change in the laws of mechanics. And he is not willing to  grant that the latter are, up to a point, no less conventional than the  former. In his opinion, the reference to mechanics settles the ques­ tion. This implies of course that a decision concerning the truth of  Postulate 5 cannot be reached by geometrical experiments alone. But  that was to be expected after Helmholtz's earlier assertion that the  axioms of geometry do not belong to the pure theory of space. He  now adds: "Geometric axioms do not speak about spatial relations  only, but also at the same time about the mechanical behaviour of our  most rigid bodies in motion".34 As a consequence of it, we must  conclude that geometry -that is, physical geometry -does not provide  a groundwork for mechanics but must be built jointly with it. It might  even seem that Helmholtz expects the more elementary mechanical  principles to provide a foundation for geometry. At any rate, he does  not ask how much in these principles has a factual import, and how  much is merely a matter of linguistic preference. One thing is clear:  pure physical geometry is indeterminate; "but if to the geometrical  axioms we add propositions relating to the mechanical properties of  natural bodies, were it only the principle of inertia, or the proposition  that the mechanical and physical properties of bodies are, under  otherwise identical circumstances, independent of place, such a </p><div id="pagenum"><p>system of propositions has a real import which can be confirmed or </p></div><div id="pagenum"><p>170 CHAPTER 3 </p></div><p id="page">refuted by experience, but just for the same reason can also be gained  by experience".35 This is a very powerful argument against the  Kantian philosophy of geometry and is perhaps the main reason why  the latter could not survive the discovery of non-Euclidean  geometries: a priori knowledge of physical space, devoid of physical  contents, is unable to determine its metrical structure with the pre­ cision required for physical applications.  In his reply to Land (1877), Helmholtz upholds an unmitigated  empiricism. He proposes a simple experiment in order to decide the  issue between the three geometries of constant curvature. I paraph­ rase: As soon as we have a method to determine whether the  distances between two-pairs are equal ("i.e. physically equivalent") we  can also determine if three points A, B, C are so placed that no other  point D # B satisfies the equations d(D, A) = deB, A) and d(D, C) =  deB, C) (where d stands for distance). We say then that A, B, C lie in  a straight line. Let us choose three points P, Q, R not in a straight  line, such that d(P, Q) = d(Q, R) = d(R, P), and two further points A,  B, such that dCA, P) = deB, P), and P, Q, A on the one hand, and P, R,  B on the other, lie in a straight line (Fig. 17). Then, if dCA, P) =  dCA, B), the Euclidean geometry is true; but BL geometry is true if  dCA, B) < d(P, A) whenever d(P, A) < d(P, Q) and spherical geometry  is true if dCA, B) > d(P, A) whenever d(P, A) < d(P, Q). (Helmholtz,  G, p. 70). Helmholtz is right indeed, if we have a method to detennine  whether the distances between two point-pairs are equal, that is,  physically equivalent. The whole issue turns therefore about this  notion, whi~h Helmholtz defines as follows: "Physisch gleichwertig  nenne ich Raumgrossen, in denen unter gleichen Bedingungen und in  gleichen Zeitabschnitten die gleichen physikalischen V organge  p  1------>..8  Q <---------" R </p><div id="pagenum"><p>Fig. 17. </p></div><div id="pagenum"><p>FOUNDATIONS 171 </p></div><p id="page">bestehen und ablaufen konnen." ("I call such spatial magnitudes  physically equivalent in which equal physical processes can occur and  develop under equal conditions and in equal times." -Helmholtz, G,  p.69; my translation; the passage does not occur in the English text  published in Mind in 1878.)  *Schlick objects that we cannot measure time without measuring  distances in space, so that we cannot determine the physical  equivalence of two magnitudes unless we know beforehand how to  determine the equality of distances (Schlick in Helmholtz, SE, p.143).  Schlick is wrong; our most exact clocks measure time without having  to measure space. But it does not seem possible to establish, with a  reasonable degree of accuracy, the physical equivalence of two  spatial magnitudes, in the above sense, unless we employ methods of  observation and control which involve the measurement of distances.  3.1.4 Lie Groups  There is a story that, just as the monarchs of Portugal and Castile  partitioned the New World among themselves by the treaty of  TordesilIas of 1494, so Felix Klein and Sophus Lie (1842-1899), while  studying in Paris in the late 1860's, divided the emerging realm of  group theory: Klein would take up discontinuous groups, letting Lie  concentrate upon the continuous ones. The results of Lie's explora­ tions are contained in the monumental Theory of Transformation  Groups, edited with the assistance of Friedrich Engel. Part V of the  third volume is devoted to a detailed study of the Helmholtz problem  of space. Lie says that this problem was brought to his attention by  his friend Klein, who told him that many mathematicians would not  accept Helmholtz's reasoning, and suggested that the problem might  be attacked successfully with the resources of Lie's group theory.36  Lie reported his results on this matter in 1886, and published them  with proofs in 1890. The content of his two papers of 1890 has been  inserted in the considerably expanded treatment of Helmholtz's  problem contained in Lie's big book.  Lie's approach to the problem is wholly foreign to the philosophy  of physics. He treats it as a problem concerning the axiomatic  foundations of geometry, regarded as a branch of pure mathematics.  If Helmholtz's reasonings were correct, his axioms HI-H4 would  provide a very concise characterization of Euclidean geometry and </p><div id="pagenum"><p>the classical non-Euclidean geometries, that is of the geometries </p></div><div id="pagenum"><p>172 CHAPTER 3 </p></div><p id="page">regarded as respectable since Klein's paper of 1871. Lie rejects  Helmholtz's argument and he is not very happy about his axioms, but  he translates the latter into several alternative sets of statements,  which do provide an adequate characterization of those geometries.  Lie's reformulations of Helmholtz's axioms are all based on the idea  we have already mentioned in Section 3.1.2. We said there that the  movements of a rigid figure in space -in terms of which Helmholtz  developed his own version of the axioms -can be represented by a  group of transformations of space. Lie takes this for granted and  studies such transformations in the context of his theory of continu­ ous groups. Before sketching Lie's treatment of Helmholtz's problem  we must say a few words about this theory and show how the  Helmholtzian concept of rigid movement can be made to fit into it.  Lie's theory is concerned with what he calls finite continuous  groups of transformations acting on a manifold. A finite continuous  gl,"oup in Lie's parlance is what we now would call an n-dimensional  connected Lie group. An n-dimensional Lie group is a set G which  has the structure of a group and also that of an n-dimensional  differentiable manifold. Between both structures there is the follow­ ing relation: the group product (g, h) ~ gh (which assigns to every  pair (g, h) of elements of the group the product of h by g) is a  differentiable mapping. A Lie group is connected if it is not the union  of two disjoint open non-empty subsets.37 The groups studied by Lie  are usually complex manifolds (i.e. manifolds charted onto open  subsets of C"). They always are analytic manifolds (i.e. the coordinate  transformations and the mapping (g, h) ~ gh can be developed into  convergent power series in a neighbourhood of each point in their  domains). We say that Lie group G acts on a differentiable manifold  M if there is a surjective differentiable mapping f: G x M -+ M, such  that for every h, g in G and every m in M,  f(hg, m) = f(h, f(g, m», fee, m) = m, (1)  (where e denotes the neutral element of G). We call f the action of G  on M. To each g in G we associate the mapping Lg: m ~ f(g, m),  defined on M. This is indeed a transformation of M.38 The set  {Lg I g E G} is a transformation group homomorphic to G. It is  isomorphic to G if, and only if, e is the only element of G such that  fee, m) = m for every m in M. If this condition is fulfilled, we say that </p><div id="pagenum"><p>G acts effectively on M. Given a group G acting on a manifold M we </p></div><div id="pagenum"><p>FOUNDATIONS 173 </p></div><p id="page">can easily define a group H that acts effectively on M. Let f denote  the action of G on M. The set K = {g I g E G and f(g, m) = m for  every m in M} is a normal subgroup of G. The quotient group G/K  acts effectively on M. It is not unreasonable, therefore, to restrict our  discussion to effective groups. Since such a group is isomorphic to its  associated transformation group, we need not distinguish it from the  latter. This entitles us to write g(m) or simply gm to denote both  f(g, m) and Lg(m) (where g belongs to a group G acting through f on  a manifold M which includes m). A group G acts transitively on a  manifold M if for every pair x, y in M there is a g in G such that  gx = y.39  Lie studies m-dimensional Lie groups acting on an n-dimensional  analytic manifold called Rn or "the space (XI> X2, ••• , xnl". The value of  n is sometimes specified. Lie's researches are local in a twofold sense:  (i) they are concerned with a neighbourhood of the identity element of  the group or, at most, with the subgroup generated by such a  neighbourhood; (ii) they consider the action of the group only on an  open subset of Rn on which a chart is defined.  We must be careful not to confuse Lie's Rn with our Rn (the nth  Cartesian power of the set of real numbers, endowed with the standard  differentiable structure). Lie -or is it his editor Engel? -invites this  confusion when, speaking of R3, he calls it "ordinary space" (der  gewohnliche Raum). But in actual usage, Rn denotes a complex manifold  (also if n = 3). Reading Volume I of Lie's Theorie der Transformations­ gruppen one has, at times, the feeling that "the space (XI> .•• , xn)"  denotes any analytic complex manifold, or perhaps only the domain of a  chart of such a manifold. But when Lie comes to determine all groups of  this or that kind acting on Rn it becomes evident that Rn denotes a  definite complex manifold. Contrary to what could be expected, this  manifold is not homeomorphic to en. Rn is said to include an (n -1)­ dimensional hyperplane "at infinity".40 We conclude, therefore, that  Lie's Rn is none other than our ~c, that is, complex n-dimensional  projective space. In some passages, Lie deals with what he calls real  groups; these are m-dimensional real manifolds (the chart ranges are  open subsets of R m) and they are allowed to act upon a real manifold.  The latter is also called Rn; I take it that in this case Rn denotes ~n, real  n-dimensional projective space.41  We shall now explain briefly how the idea of rigid movement can be </p><div id="pagenum"><p>inserted in the framework of Lie's theory. We take the matter up </p></div><div id="pagenum"><p>174 CHAPTER 3 </p></div><p id="page">where we left it on p.160. The movements of a rigid body in  Euclidean 3-space ~3 are represented by a group of transformations  of ~3, the group of Euclidean motions. According to Helmholtz's  axiom H2 this group preserves a function on ~3 x ~3 whose value is  the same for all congruent point-pairs. However, not every trans­ formation of ~3 which preserves congruence between point-pairs will  preserve congruence between spatial figures. The group of Euclidean  motions is therefore a subset of the group of transformations of ~3  which preserve congruence between point-pairs. Let x denote a  Cartesian mapping and let Po, Ph P2, P3 be four points in ~3 such that  x(Po) = (0,0,0), x(p\) = (1,0,0), x(P 2) = (0,1,0) and x(P 3) = (0,0, o.  An isometry g: ~3 -')0 ~3 is completely determined if we know the four  values g(P i) (0:$ i :$ 3); in other words, the 12-tuple formed by the  coordinates of these four points defines a unique isometry g. But  these coordinates cannot be chosen arbitrarily. Indeed, if we fix g(Po),  the images of the other three points by g must lie on the unit  sphere centred at g(Po). Thus, if we know the three coordinates of  g(Po), the position of g(p\) depends only on two additional arbitrary  real numbers, e.g. the two angles which the directed line from g(Po) to  g(Pd makes with the planes {P I x\(P) = O} and {P I x2(P) = O}. If we  fix both g(Po) and g(p\), then g(P 2) and g(P 3) must lie at right angles  on the unit circle centred at g(P o) on the plane perpendicular to the  line (g(P o), g(P t». The choice of a single real number will therefore  suffice to fix g(P 2). If g(Po), g(Pd and g(P 2) are known, there are only  two positions which g(P 3) can take, namely, the two points at unit  distance from g(Po) on the perpendicular through this point to the  plane on which g(Po), g(P t) and g(P 2) lie. If g(P 3) is one of these two  points, the tetrahedron K whose four vertices lie at the four points Pi  (0:$ i :$ 3) is congruent with the tetrahedron g(K) whose vertices lie at  the points g(Pd; if g(P 3) is the other point g(K) is a mirror image of  K. The transformations of ~3 that preserve congruence between  point-pairs fall into two classes: the class of those which map K onto  a congruent tetrahedron and the class of those which map K onto a  mirror image. Only a transformation of the first class is a Euclidean  motion. Our analysis shows that six arbitrary real numbers suffice to  define it uniquely. There are many ways of choosing those six  numbers, but if we settle upon one, we define thereby an injective  mapping of the set At of the Euclidean motions into R6. By suitably </p><div id="pagenum"><p>modifying and restricting this mapping we can obtain an atlas which </p></div><div id="pagenum"><p>FOUNDATIONS 175 </p></div><p id="page">bestows on .Ai the structure of a 6-dimensional analytic manifold . .Ai  is clearly a group. To show that it is a Lie group acting on ~3 we  would also have to show that the action and the group product  (g, h) ~ gh are analytic mappings.  * Assuming that they are, we shall discuss briefly Lie's method of  representing the action of .Ai on ~3. Let V be the domain of a chart t  defined at the identity e in .Ai, with coordinate functions t\ ... , t6• Let  y be a Cartesian mapping of ~3, with coordinate functions y 1, y2, y3.  Then (t, x) is a chart of .Ai x ~3 defined on V x ~3. Let I denote the  action of .Ai on ~3. The restriction of I to V X ~3 can be represented  by three functions Ii: t(V) x y(~3) -+ R, defined as follows:  l;(tl(g), ... ,t6(g), yl(p), ... ,y3(p» = yi(f(g, P»,  (g E V, P E ~3, i = 1, 2, 3). (2)  Lie writes ti for ti(g), Yk for yk(p), yj for /(f(g, P». The above  representation is then given as follows:  (i = 1,2,3). (3)  Since leg, P) is the point g(P) on which P E ~3 is mapped by the  motion g, the functions {i give us, for a fixed g,. the coordinates of  g(P) in terms of the coordinates of P. On our assumption that .Ai is  indeed a Lie group acting on ~3, the representative functions {i are  analytic. If g, h E V, P E ~3, we have that  /(f(gh, P» = /(f(g, {(h, P))) = {;(I(g), y(f(h, P»)  = {i(t(g), Ut(h), y(P», h(t(h), yep»~,  h(t(h), yep))), (4)  (where t(g) denotes the sextuple (t I(g), ... , t6(g », etc.). Knowledge  of the functions {i enables us therefore to compute the coordinates of  I(g, P) for every g in .Ai which is the product of elements of V. Lie  usually represents the action of a Lie group G on the space Rn by  means of analytic functions defined like the {i above. Let us call this  the standard representation of group action. The representation is  local. However, though it is originally defined only on a neighbour­ hood U of e E G, it can be extended, in the fashion we have </p><div id="pagenum"><p>explained, to the full subgroup of G generated by V. This subgroup is </p></div><div id="pagenum"><p>176 CHAPTER 3 </p></div><p id="page">equal to G if G is connected and U includes the inverse of each of its  elements. On the other hand, no representative functions fi can be  defined on an arbitrary pair (g, x) (g E G, x ERn) unless there is a  chart defined at both x and f(g, x). Since Rn (= gil;:) is not wholly covered  by any chart, it may well happen that the latter condition is not fulfilled.  3.1.5 Lie's Solution of Helmholtz's Problem  Lie's approach to geometry was deeply influenced by Klein's views  (Part 2.3). To obtain a unified theory covering Euclidean geometry  and the classical non-Euclidean systems, we imbed the Euclidean  space ~3 in gIl~. Each motion f in .Jl is extended to the whole of gIl~.  The set .Jl of (extended) Euclidean motions is then a subgroup of the  general group of analytic transformations of ~~ into itself . .Jl is, in  fact, contained within another subgroup of this group, which includes  all collineations of gIl~. The said subgroup contains other important  subgroups, related to the Euclidean motions, namely the groups of  collineations that map a non-degenerate quadric onto itself. These fall  into two families. Each group of one family maps a given real quadric  onto itself, each group of the other maps a purely imaginary quadric  onto itself. Lie chooses a quadric of each kind and takes the cor­ responding group as a representative of its family. The two groups  thus defined are called by him the groups of non-Euclidean motions  of R3 (that is, of ~~). These names and concepts are easily extended  to the n-dimensional case.  These ideas provide the context for Lie's statement of Helmholtz's  problem: What properties are necessary and sufficient to characterize  the group of Euclidean motions and the two groups of non-Euclidean  motions of gjl;:, thus distinguishing them from all other groups of  analytic transformations of gjl;:?42 Let us call this the Helmholtz-Lie  or HL problem. Lie gives two principal solutions of it, one of which is  valid only for n = 3. They are preceded by two other subsidiary  solutions, based on a direct reworking of Helmholtz's paper of 1868.  Lie's treatment of the problem rests on a close study of the group­ theoretical implications of Helmholtz's axioms H2 and H3. In order to  state these implications, we introduce the concept of a group-in­ variant. Let G be a Lie group acting on a manifold M. An n-point  invariant of G is a function f: Mn ~ R, such that for every g E G,  Xl. ... ,Xn E M, f(xt. ... , xn) = f(g(xl), ... ,g(x n». To avoid trivial ex­</p><div id="pagenum"><p>ceptions, we exclude constant functions. We say that an invariant f </p></div><div id="pagenum"><p>FOUNDATIONS 177 </p></div><p id="page">depends on other invariants It. ... ,/b if the value of I at each point x  in M is determined by the values of t.. ... , Ik at x. An n-point  invariant of G is essential if there does not exist a set {f;h,S;Sk of  m;-point invariants (m; < n for every i), on which it depends. Now let  M denote the still indeterminate n-dimensional manifold mentioned in  Helmholtz's axioms. Let us represent the movements of a rigid body  in M by a Lie group G acting on M. Since H3(a) postulates free  mobility, G must act transitively on M. Consequently G cannot have a  one-point invariant. H2 clearly states that G has a two-point invariant  (described there as "an equation" not altered by movement, between  the 2n coordinates of each point-pair). We denote this invariant by d.  H3(a) implies that G has no essential n-point invariants for n > 2.  H3(b) implies that G has only one two-point invariant (or rather, that  all two-point invariants of G depend only on one). Let us explain this.  H3(a) states that the movements of a point x E M are restricted only  by the equations binding its coordinates to those of every other point  of M. In other words, they are restricted only by the requirement that  I(x, y) = I(g(x), g(y)) for every y EM, g E G, and for every two-point  invariant I of G. This means that there can be no essential n-point  invariant of G for n > 2, because if there was one its existence would  impose additional restrictions on the movement of x. We know that G  has at least one two-point invariant d. H2 and H3(a) do not imply that  there are no other two-point invariants of d, but such is the purport of  H3(b). According to the latter, if we fix a point x in M, every other  point y in M is bound in its movements by a single equation. We see  now that this can only refer to the condition d(x, y) = d(g(x), g(y)) for  every g E G. But if G had another two-point invariant d', not depen­ dent on d, every g E G would have to fulfil the additional condition  d'(x, y) = d'(g(x), g(y)), and this requirement would further restrict  the movements of an arbitrary y E M when a given x E M is fixed.  Lie understands that the n-dimensional manifold we have been  calling M in his Rn (that is, g>~), or an open subset of Rn. The  foregoing analysis shows that solution of the HL problem along  Helmholtz's lines could be obtained by solving first the following  group-theoretical problem: To detennine all the finite continuous  groups of Rn which have no one-point invariant, exactly one (in­ dependent) two-point invariant and no essential k-point invariant for  k > 2. The problem is solved for R3 in Lie's second paper of 1890. Lie </p><div id="pagenum"><p>shows that all such groups must be 6-dimensional. The powerful </p></div><div id="pagenum"><p>178 CHAPTER 3 </p></div><p id="page">machinery of his theory enables him to give an exhaustive list, both  for the general case of complex groups and for the case of real  groups. These lists include the three groups of Euclidean and non­ Euclidean motions, but they also include several other groups. The  HL problem will be solved if we can find properties of the first three  groups which are not shared by the remaining groups.  We shall omit the details of Lie's alternative axiom systems,43 and  shall only sketch the main idea of his final solution of the n­ dimensional case. This solution deals with real Lie groups, that is, Lie  groups charted into Rm ("groups with real parameters", in Lie's  idiom). The manifold on which they act, denoted by Rn, is, as usual,  the complex space ~c. Lie's characterization of the Euclidean and  non-Euclidean groups of motions utilizes the concept of free mobility  in the infinitesimal, which we shall now define. Let G be a Lie group  acting on a manifold M. We say that G fixes a tangent vector v at  P E M if, for every gin G, g*p(v) = v (this implies, by the way, that, for  all g E G, g(P) = P; we express this by saying that G fixes p).44 Now  let G be a real Lie group acting on Rn (n ~ 3). We say that G  possesses free mobility in the infinitesimal at a real point P E Rn if, for  every set of n -2 linearly independent tangent vectors Vt. •.• , Vn-2 at  P, there is a proper subgroup of G which fixes Vt. •.. ,Vn-2, but the  only subgroup of G which fixes n - 1 linearly independent tangent  vectors at P is the improper subgroup {e}, whose sole member is the  identity. Lie's conclusion is stated thus: If a real finite continuous  group of Rn (n ~ 3) possesses free mobility in the infinitesimal at  every point of general position, it is a transitive !n(n + 1) dimensional  group which is similar (through a real point-transformation) to the  group of Euclidean motions or to one of the two groups of non­ Euclidean motions of Rn.45 The Euclidean group distinguishes itself  from the others because it alone possesses a proper normal subgroup  (the group of translations).46 By a point of general position I suppose  that we must understand an arbitrary real point inside a given  connected open set of Rn. In fact, the group of Euclidean motions  does not possess free mobility in the infinitesimal at the points "at  infinity".47  Lie takes his solution of the HL problem for a conclusive proof of  Riemann's claim that only on R-manifolds of constant curvature can  a figure be freely rotated or displaced without expanding or contrac­</p><div id="pagenum"><p>ting. In a way he is right. But we should not overlook an important </p></div><div id="pagenum"><p>FOUNDATIONS 179 </p></div><p id="page">difference between Lie's approach and Riemann's. The latter thought  he spoke about different spaces, which may have incompatible global  topological properties (thus, his spherical space is compact, while  Euclidean space is not). He believed that one of these spaces (at  most) could provide a true representation of physical space. Lie, on  the other hand, is concerned with different groups acting on one and  the same manifold, complex projective space. The basic geometrical  concept of congruence is defined on this space, or rather, on a  suitable open subset of it, by the choice of one of those groups. Two  figures inside the suitable region will be said to be congruent if one is  the image of the other by a transformation of the chosen group. Did  Lie take flJ3 for an adequate representation of physical space? This  thoroughbred mathematician does not waste one word on the matter.  But he was no doubt aware of the fact that every problem in  19th-century mathematical physics has to do with entities which can  be represented in an open subset of flJ3. Questions concerning the  global structure of real space he would probably have dismissed as  metaphysical.  *Lie shows in a short note that Riemann's Postulate R3 follows  directly from the requirement of free mobility in the infinitesimal. The  proof does not depend on the theorem that characterizes the Eucli­ dean and the non-Euclidean groups. "Every real group (of Rn) which  possesses free mobility in the infinitesimal at a real point of general  position leaves a positive definite quadratic differential expression  invariant [ ... J. Riemann's axiom concerning the line element can be  thus derived from the axiom of free mobility in the infinitesimal, even  without actually determining the groups that possess such free mobil­ ity." (Lie, TT, Vol. III, pp. 496 f.). The reader will recall that the main  aim of Helmholtz's paper of 1868 was to deduce R3 from the  requirement of free mobility of (finite) rigid bodies.  3.1.6 Poincare and Killing on the Foundations of Geometry  Other mathematicians applied Lie's theory of transformation groups  in their researches on the foundations of geometry at about the same  time as he did. We shall comment here on two works by Henri  Poincare (1854-1912) and Wilhelm Killing (1847-1923).  On November 2, 1887, Poincare submitted to the Societe Mathem­ atique de France a paper on the fundamental hypotheses of </p><div id="pagenum"><p>geometry.48 In it, he recalls that geometry, as a demonstrative science, </p></div><div id="pagenum"><p>180 CHAPTER 3 </p></div><p id="page">must rest on undemonstrated premises. These, however, will not be  found among the propositions stated under the name of axioms at the  head of geometrical treatises, for such are either definitions or general  principles of mathematical analysis. The necessary assumptions are  introduced surreptitiously in the proofs of particular theorems. Not  all these assumptions are necessary, however, for some of them could  be deduced from the others. This leads to the following problem: To  state without redundance all the necessary assumptions of geometry.  Poincare's paper is an attempt to solve this problem for two-dimen­ sional or plane geometry.  He begins with a short discussion of a family of two-dimensional  geometries which he calls .. quadratic". These are obtained from  projective space geometry, but, as two-dimensional geometries, they  can be made to stand on their own feet. The general characterization  of a quadratic geometry is given as follows. Let S be a quadric. Any  line where S intersects a plane which passes through its diameter, we  call 'straight'; every other plane section of S we call a 'circle'. If m, n  are two 'straights' meeting at a point P in S, the size of the angle  (m, n) is defined as follows: let p, q be the two rectilinear generators  of S through P; let k denote the cross-ratio (m, n; p, q); the size of the  angle (m, n) is log k if p, q are real, (1/i) log k if p, q are imaginary  (this depends only on the nature of S). The length of a segment PQ on  a 'straight' m is defined as follows: m is obviously a conic; let X, Y  be its two points at infinity; we denote by k the cross-ratio (P, Q; X,  V); the length of PQ is log k if m is a hyperbola and (Iii) log k if m is  an ellipse (again this depends only on the nature of S). On the basis of  ordinary projective space geometry, we can obtain infinitely many  theorems about 'straights' and 'circles' and the figures formed by  them on a quadric S. Now drop the quotation marks. If S is an elliptic  paraboloid, the theorems will read exactly like the theorems of  Euclidean plane geometry. If S is a two-sheet hyperboloid, the  theorems read like those of BL plane geometry. If S is an ellipsoid,  they agree with the theorems of spherical geometry. These are the  three two-dimensional geometries familiar to Poincare (Klein's elliptic  geometry has apparently escaped him). But there are still other  quadratic geometries, which arise if S is a non-degenerate one-sheet  hyperboloid, or one of its degenerate forms. Poincare's first aim is to </p><div id="pagenum"><p>furnish all quadratic geometries (regarded as plane geometries, i.e. </p></div><div id="pagenum"><p>FOUNDATIONS 181 </p></div><p id="page">independently of their original definition by means of projective space  geometry) with a common axiomatic foundation.  Poincare states two axioms common to every two-dimensional  geometry:  (A) The plane has two dimensions.  (B) The position of a figure in the plane is determined by three  conditions.  He considers that these apparently simple axioms entitle him to use  Lie's group theory in the further specification of viable two-dimen­ sional geometries. This implies that he, in fact, understands Axioms A  and B as follows:  (A') The plane is a two-dimensional differentiable manifold.  (B') The motions of the plane constitute a three-dimensional Lie  group acting on the plane.  Here, I mean by motion a transformation of the plane which maps  every plane figure onto a figure regarded as equal to it (the same  figure in a possibly different position, to use the words of Axiom B).  Using B' we can characterize a two-dimensional geometry by choos­ ing as its group of motions a three-dimensional group acting on R2.  This choice determines what figures are regarded as equal (or the  same) in that geometry. Lie had determined all three-dimensional  groups of R2. Two of them are excluded by the following axiom:  (e) If a plane figure is not allowed to leave the plane and if two of  its points are fixed, then the whole figure is fixed.  (This is equivalent to the following: C'. The group of motions of the  plane does not contain a one-dimensional subgroup which fixes two  points of the plane.) The remaining three-dimensional groups are the  groups of motions of the quadratic geometries. These include Eucli­ dean, BL and spherical geometry, and also, as we said, the geometry  defined by a one-sheet hyperboloid. Poincare takes pleasure in  describing the paradoxical features of this geometry: (a) The length of  the segment joining two points on the same rectilinear generator of  the hyperboloid is equal to zero. (b) We recall that 'straights' are  plane sections determined by a plane passing through a diameter of  the hyperboloid; there are two kinds of them, namely ellipses and  hyperbolae; no real motion of this geometry can map a 'straight' of  one kind into one of the other kind. (c) No motion except the identity </p><div id="pagenum"><p>will fix a point P on a 'straight' m while mapping m onto itself. This </p></div><div id="pagenum"><p>182 CHAPTER 3 </p></div><p id="page">geometry will therefore be excluded by adding one of the equivalent  axioms D or E.  (D) The distance between points P and Q is equal to 0 only if  P = Q.49  (E) If m and n are two straights meeting at a point P, m can be  rotated about P until it coincides with n.  The axioms A, B, C and D or E are therefore sufficient to characterize  the three classical geometries. Spherical geometry is excluded by:  (F) Two straights cannot meet at more than one point.  BL geometry is excluded by:  (G) The sum of the three angles of a triangle is constant.  Actually, A, B, C, G suffice to characterize Euclidean plane geometry,  because D, E, F can be inferred from them. At the end of his paper,  Poincare makes a few important epistemological remarks which we  shall examine when we discuss his philosophy of geometry (Part  4.4).  Killing's long paper "Ueber die Grundlagen der Geometrie" (1892)  is more ambitious but less successful than Poincare's. He deals from  the outset with n-dimensional geometry. He sets up a system of eight  axioms stated in familiar, intuitively appealing terms. But the reason­ ings based upon them do not seem to follow from them in a clear-cut  way. Killing points out that a demonstrative science does not only  require a set of undemonstrated premises but also a set of undefined  concepts. His choice of primitive concepts for geometry is somewhat  surprising. They are: solid body, part of a body, space, part of space,  to occupy a space (to cover), time, rest, movement. I do not dispute  that any set of terms can be chosen as primitive if they are ap­ propriately combined in axioms in which no other non-logical terms  occur. But Killing's use of his primitive concepts is not so neat. Thus,  apparently because time is one of them, he feels entitled to introduce  in the axioms such expressions as simultaneously, earlier than, as  soon as, whose meaning is not explicitly defined, nor, it seems,  sufficiently determined by the axioms in which they occur. To give an  idea of Killing's style, let us quote Axiom V:  A body which before a movement has no part in common with a space and lies entirely  within that space after the movement, reaches in the course of the movement a position  in which only a part of it lies within that space.'o </p><div id="pagenum"><p>Commenting on this axiom, Killing says that it asserts that movement </p></div><div id="pagenum"><p>FOUNDATIONS 183 </p></div><p id="page">is continuous. Since not a word about continuity is said in the  remaining axioms, we must understand that the fundamental concepts  of space, time and body tacitly include all the properties traditionally  associated to that term. When such a wealth of assumptions is hidden  in the intended meaning of the primitive terms, the deductive method  becomes a royal road to truth, as readers of metaphysical literature  well know.  Although Killing's work is instructive in more than one way, we  shall make only a few remarks about it.  (i) Killing says that his first seven axioms define a theory  equivalent to the general theory of finite continuous transitive groups  of transformations. 51 The theory of intransitive groups, he says, can  be obtained from the former through the study of subgroups. This  theory he proposes to call generalized geometry, the science of  "space-forms in a general sense". "Space-forms properly so-called"  are defined however by adding Axiom VIII, which "supplies the  concepts of size and shape".52 The purport of this axiom is ap­ proximately the following: Let A be a body consisting of two disjoint  but connected parts Band C; let B occupy a space S at the beginning  of a movement m. If, at no time during m, B ns = 0, there exists a  space S'( ~ 0) such that at all times during m, ens' = 0. C is therefore  confined during m to a spatial region S" which is contained in the  complement of S'. Now, if a body K lies partly within S' at the  beginning of a movement m' and partly within S at the end of m',  there is a time during m' when K lies partly in S" (end of the axiom).  (ii) Killing tries to give a topological definition of the number of  dimensions of a space. His words are far from clear and I am not sure  that I have understood them rightly. His definition may be translated  thus:  If n + 1 parts of space are mutually connected, each to each, and this connection  persists after we remove from every part those regions which are not connected with  another part, the highest number n which can be thus obtained is the number of  dimensions."  I take it that space is endowed with a topology and that a part of  space is the closure of an open set. Two parts of space are connected  if they share a boundary point. "The regions which are not connected  with another part" are those which lie outside an arbitrarily small </p><div id="pagenum"><p>neighbourhood of the common boundary. On this interpretation, </p></div><div id="pagenum"><p>184 CHAPTER 3 </p></div><p id="page">however, a plane will be seen to have infinite dimensions, since we  can find, for every number n, n + I triangular parts which meet at a  common vertex. We avoid this counterexample if we understand that  two parts A and B are connected, in Killing's sense, only if there is a  point P on their common boundary which does not lie on the  boundary of any other part. (Killing himself, however, suggests  nothing of the sort.) But even with this proviso, the plane would have  three dimensions, not two, according to Killing's definition, as one  can gather from Fig. 18. Killing's definition shows anyhow that as far  back as 1892 there was a mathematician who was no longer willing to  go on repeating that an n-dimensional space is a space that can be  charted by means of n coordinate functions.  (iii) Killing's paper contains one contribution of permanent value:  the concept of what we now call a Killing vector field. Let M be an  n-dimensional R-manifold. Let the metric be defined in terms of a  chart x by gii = JL(a/ax i, iJ/axi). Let X be a vector field on M such that,  in terms of x, X = ~i gi a/axi. Then X is a Killing vector field if the gi  are solutions of Killing's system of differential equations;54  (1)  It can be shown that a one-parameter group of transformations acting  on an R-manifold preserves congruence if, and only if, it is generated  by a Killing vector field. 55 Lie's results (p.178) imply that an n­ dimensional manifold M admits at most n(n + 1)/2 independent  Killing vector fields, which generate its n (n + 1)12-parameter tran­ sitive group of motions. If M admits the maximum number of Killing  vectors it is said to be maximally symmetric. As we know, an  R-manifold is maximally symmetric only if it has constant curvature.  We shall illustrate the concept of a Killing vector field with an  example. Let S be a surface of revolution with only one axis of  1 </p><div id="pagenum"><p>Fig. 18. </p></div><div id="pagenum"><p>FOUNDATIONS 185 </p></div><p id="page">symmetry. A figure F on S cannot generally be transported over S in  an arbitrary direction, without losing its original shape. However, any  rotation about the axis of S maps F onto a congruent figure. Under  such a rotation each point of F describes a curve which lies wholly on  a plane normal to the axis of S. Every curve fulfilling this condition is  the range of an integral path of a Killing vector field on S. On the  other hand, the integral paths of every Killing vector field on Shave  their ranges along such curves. The notion of a Killing vector field  suggests the convenience of (and provides an instrument for) studying  the geometry of R-manifolds with intransitive groups of motions, that  is, manifolds where congruence-preserving transformations which  map a given point on any arbitrary point are not generally available.  The study of such manifolds liberates us from Helmholtz's dogma of  complete free mobility and the consequent recognition of only three  'established' geometries. We go, thus, a long way back to Riemann's  broadminded conception of geometry.  3.1.7 Hilbert's Group- Theoretical Characterization  of the Euclidean Plane  A drastic change in the approach to the HL problem was brought  about by David Hilbert in his article "Ueber die Grundlagen der  Geometrie" (1902). Three years earlier, he had published his cele­ brated Grundlagen der Geometrie, in which, as we shall see in Part  3.2, he endeavoured to analyze the presuppositions of Euclidean  geometry into a number of simple conditions, instead of expressing  their full import in a few powerful premises. The concept of a  transformation group plays no role in that book. In the paper of 1902,  however, as in the writings of Lie and Poincare, the group of motions  defines the geometry, and this makes for a great conciseness in the  statement of its basic principles. But Hilbert finds that the assump­ tions of his predecessors were unnecessarily strong and shows how to  characterize either Euclidean or BL geometry by means of a surpris­ ingly frugal set of axioms. The paper is a masterpiece of careful,  patient mathematical reasoning, making very few demands on the  reader's specialized knowledge. We shall state and explain his  axioms, so as to show wherein lies the novelty of his approach.  We saw that Lie characterized the classical metric geometries by  means of a Lie group, i.e. a group which is a differentiable manifold, </p><div id="pagenum"><p>with differentiable, indeed analytic group mappings (g, h) ~ gh and </p></div><div id="pagenum"><p>186 CHAPTER 3 </p></div><p id="page">g I--'; g -I. According to Hilbert, these conditions can be expressed in  purely geometric terms only in a very unnatural and complicated way.  The axiom system propounded by him, though based on the group  concept, contains only very simple geometric requirements. The  paper studies solely the foundations of plane geometry, but Hilbert  believes that a similar axiom system can be set up for higher­ dimensional geometries.  Hilbert first defines the plane. His definition is long, but translated  into present-day terminology it is tantamount to the following: The  plane is a topological space homeomorphic to R2.  Hilbert did not possess, in 1902, the modern concept of a topologi­ cal space, but his definition of the plane was a significant step in the  development of that concept. He employs the notion of a Jordan  domain. Let us explain what this means. Let f be a continuous  mapping of a closed interval [a, b) C R into R 2. If f is injective on the  open interval (a, b), f is called a (plane) Jordan curve. If {(a) = f(b), {  is closed. Camille Jordan proved in a paper which set new standards  of mathematical rigour that a closed Jordan curve f divides R2 into  two regions, the interior and the exterior of {, so that, if g: [0, 1] ~ R2  is another Jordan curve such that g(O) lies on the interior of f and  g(l) lies on its exterior, then g(t) lies on the range of f for some t  (0 < t < I). The interior of a Jordan curve is called by Hilbert a Jordan  domain (Gebiet). If we endow R 2 with the standard topology, every  Jordan domain is indeed a connected open set. Let us paraphrase  Hilbert's definition of the plane: A plane is a set 1T of objects called  points, such that (i) there exists an injective mapping x: 1T ~ R 2; (ii) let  P E 1T; a neighbourhood (Umgebung) of P is a Jordan domain Up such  that x(P) E Up C x( 1T); there exists a neighbourhood of P; (iii) if Up  is a neighbourhood of P and J is a Jordan domain such that x(P) E  J CUp, then J is a neighbourhood of P; (iv) if P, Q E 1T, Up is a  neighbourhood of P and x(Q) E Up, then Up is a neighbourhood of Q;  (v) if P, Q E 1T, there is a neighbourhood Up of P such that x(Q) E Up.  This definition implies that 1T is homeomorphic to R2, if we allow x to  induce a topology on 1T in the following obvious way: if J is a Jordan  domain contained in x( 1T), X-I(J) is an open set of 1T; all open sets of  1T are such by virtue of this stipulation and the topological axioms.  This is the weakest topology which makes x into a continuous  mapping. Relatively to it, x is evidently a homeomorphism of 1T onto </p><div id="pagenum"><p>x( 1T). We shall show that x( 1T) is a connected open set of R 2. Choose </p></div><div id="pagenum"><p>FOUNDATIONS 187 </p></div><p id="page">any point p E x(1I"); by (ii) there exists a closed Jordan curve whose  interior contains p and is contained in x( 11"); consequently x( 11") is  open. Choose any two points p, q in x(1I"); by (v) there exists a closed  Jordan curve whose interior contains p and q and is contained in  x( 11"); consequently x( 11") is connected. Therefore, x( 11") is  homeomorphic to R2. Hence, 11" is homeomorphic to R2. On the other  hand, if we assume this, conditions (i)-(v) will follow.  Let x map 11" homeomorphically onto R2. We paraphrase Hilbert's  definition of motion: a motion of 11" is a bijective continuous mapping  g:1T~1T, such that, if f:[a,b]~R2 is a closed Jordan curve,  x . g . X-I. f is a closed Jordan curve with the same (clockwise or  counterclockwise) sense as f. Let gP denote the value of a motion g  at P E 1T. We consider now a set G of motions of 1T. If P E 1T, g E G and  g P = P, we call g a rotation about P. Let Gp denote the set of  rotations about P. If Q E 1T, the set {gQ I g E G p} is called the true  circle through Q, centred at P. If (A, B, C), (A', B', C') are two  point-triplets and there exists a motion g such that gA = A', gB = B'  and gC = C', we say that the two triplets are congruent (ABC 2:  A'B'C'). We can now state Hilbert's axioms:  (1) If g E G, h E G, then g . h E G.  (II) A true circle is an infinite set.  (III) Let AI> A2, A 3, A;, A2, A3 be points of 1T. If, for every 8 > 0  there is agE G such that ix(Ai) -x(gAi)i < £ (j = 1,2,3), then  AIA2 A32: A;A2A 3.56  Hilbert proves that, if G fulfils these three axioms, then G is either the  group of Euclidean motions or the group of BL motions of the  plane.57 Congruence, as defined above, is therefore synonymous  either with Euclidean congruence or with BL congruence. Thus, the  strong but quite familiar assumptions expressed in the definitions of  plane and motion, plus Axioms I-III are altogether sufficient to  characterize Bolyai's absolute geometry of the plane. We obtain  Euclidean or BL plane geometry by merely adding the axiom of  parallels or its negation.  Towards the end of his paper, Hilbert draws our attention to the  difference between this axiomatic foundation of geometry and the one  given in his Grundlagen. In the earlier book, continuity is postulated  last. This naturally leads to ask which of the familiar propositions and  proofs of geometry do not depend on this assumption. The answer to </p><div id="pagenum"><p>this question is quite surprising, as we shall see. In the paper of 1902, </p></div><div id="pagenum"><p>188 CHAPTER 3 </p></div><p id="page">continuity is assumed from the outset in the definition of the plane  and of its motions, and Hilbert takes full advantage of it in his proofs.  The main task consists now in finding the minimal conditions that  must be added to continuity in order to define the basic geometrical  notions of the circle and the straight line and to ascribe them the  properties required for the construction of geometry. Such condi­ tions, as we saw, are very modest indeed.  Elliptic geometry had been excluded from the very beginning by  the assumption that the plane is homeomorphic to R2. Hilbert obser­ ves in a footnote that there should be no difficulty in including it if we  suitably modify his concepts and reasonings.58 Such a modification  would involve, of course, a change in the global topological properties  of the plane. Hilbert does not employ this terminology. But his  approach shows a new awareness of the significance of global pro­ perties, which had been so frightfully neglected in Lie-Engel's book,  and in Poincare's paper of 1887.  In the light of Hilbert (1902) we can restate the HL problem thus:  Let S be a topological space and G a group of transformations of S;  what additional requirements must be met by Sand G in order that G  be characterized as one of the classical- i.e. Euclidean, hyperbolical,  elliptical or spherical- groups of motions? J. Tits solved this problem  in 1952. An improved solution was given by H. Freudenthal (1956),  who has summarized his results as follows. Let S be a locally  compact connected metric space. Let there exist, for any two  sufficiently small congruent triangles in S, an isometry of S that maps  one of the triangles onto the other. Then S is a real Euclidean,  hyperbolic, elliptic or spherical space. (Freudenthal in Behnke et al.,  FM, Vol. II, p. 532; for details, see Freudenthal's survey article in  English, "Lie Groups in the Foundations of Geometry" (1965».  Another, very elegant solution of the HL problem which does not  depend on differentiability assumptions was given in 1955 by Herbert  Busemann in the context of his theory of G-spaces. (Busemann, GG,  p. 336; I thank Professor H. Schwerdtfeger for drawing my attention  to Busemann's work.)  3.2 AXIOMATICS  3.2.1 The Begillnings of Modem Geometrical Axiomatics  The geometer's ability to derive by sheer force of reasoning a </p><div id="pagenum"><p>multitude of complex and abstruse propositions from a few simple </p></div><div id="pagenum"><p>FOUNDATIONS 189 </p></div><p id="page">and apparently obvious truths has always aroused the admiration of  learned men and was probably the main reason why Euclid's Ele­ ments were given a privileged position in Western education. The  deductive structure of the Elements was imitated in the two greatest  scientific works of the 17th century, the Fourth Day of Galilei's  Discorsi and Newton's Mathematical Principles of Natural Philoso­ phy. It was also regarded by most philosophers of that time as an  example to be followed in their writings, though only Spinoza had the  courage to do so ostensibly.! Careful students of the Elements were  by then aware that the book did not always live up to the standards of  logical rigour for which it was praised and which it certainly observed  in many of its proofs. We noted on p.44 that John Wallis knew that  many demonstrations in Euclid depend on unstated assumptions. In  his Elements de geometrie (1685) Father B. Lamy (1640-1715) made a  point of formulating several propositions "contained in the idea of a  straight line", which "geometers assume [ ... J without saying SO".2 A  similar tendency to make explicit that which is tacitly understood in  the Elements is noticeable in some 18th-century German textbooks,  such as Andreas Segner's Elementa arithmeticae et geometriae (1739)  and A.G. Kastner's Anfangsgrunde der Arithmetik, Geometrie, Tri­ gonometrie und Perspektive (1758).3 Surprisingly, however, no attempt  at bringing out every presupposition of Euclid and filling all the gaps  in his proofs was carried out in earnest until the end of the 19th  century. In his Lectures on Modern Geometry (1882), Moritz Pasch  gave a rigorous axiomatic reconstruction of projective geometry.  Further contributions to geometrical axiomatics were made by the  Italians Peano (1889, 1894), Veronese (1891), Enriques (1898), Pieri  (1899a, b). Hilbert published his Foundations of Geometry in 1899.  One might feel inclined to think that the rise of non-Euclidean  geometry -which could not resort to genuine or apparent intuition in  its proofs -must have powerfully contributed to stimulate the interest  of geometers in unimpeachable logical deduction. In fact, Bolyai's  monograph and the better parts of Saccheri's book are models of  careful reasoning, and I.H. Lambert, the remarkable forerunner of  Bolyai and Lobachevsky, was one of the first to see clearly that  geometrical proofs should not depend on a "representation of their  subject-matter".4 It is probably no accident that I. Hoilel, who in the  1860's published French translations of Bolyai's Absolute Science </p><div id="pagenum"><p>of Space and Lobachevsky's Theory of Parallels, of Gauss' </p></div><div id="pagenum"><p>190 CHAPTER 3 </p></div><p id="page">correspondence with Schumacher and the basic papers by Riemann,  Helmholtz and Beltrami, should have worked at the same time on a new  axiom system for Euclidean geometry (Section 3.2.4). Nevertheless, by  today's standards, none of these writers really went much further than  Euclid himself in making explicit the premises of geometry. A statement  such as Pasch's axiom, which says that a straight line running into the  interior of a triangle eventually comes out of it, was, so to speak, too  transparent for our authors to see it, present and active, in the most basic  proofs of geometry.  Ernest Nagel (1939) is probably right in stressing the importance of  projective geometry in the development of the new axiomatics. This  branch of geometry was fully axiomatized by Pasch two decades  before Hilbert's axiomatization of Euclidean geometry. Indeed, as we  suggested on p.110, the counterintuitive features of the projective  plane and of projective space made their axiomatic characterization  almost imperative. M:)feover, as Nagel rightly observed, duality,  correlations and the free choice of the fundamental elements of space  were certainly instrumental in making 19th-century geometers aware  that their true concern was with abstract structures, not with parti­ cular things. The organization of geometry as a strictly deductive  science, a collection of gapless axiomatic theories, was, of course, the  natural way to deal with structures, because axiomatic theories are  constitutively abstract. The unavoidably abstract nature of axiomatic  theories will be explained in the next section. But one can ap­ proximately see what it means by recalling the well-known thesis of  Hilbert, that the planes, lines and points of his Grundlagen may be  taken to be any threefold collection of things -Hilbert once proposed  chairs, tables and beer-mugs -which, given a suitable interpretation  of the undefined properties of incidence, betweenness and  congruence, happen to stand in the relations characterized by his  axioms. The true subject-matter of the axioms and the theorems  inferred from them is the net of relations in which points, lines and  planes are caught, not the individual nature of the points, lines and  planes themselves. What matters is the type of those relations as  such, not those idiosyncratic traits they might derive from the pecu­ liarities of the objects holding them. Now, the discovery of projective  duality was certainly apt to suggest such a view of geometry, and of  mathematics generally. Duality implies that the theorems, say, of </p><div id="pagenum"><p>plane projective geometry are true of the plane whether we regard it </p></div><div id="pagenum"><p>FOUNDATIONS 191 </p></div><p id="page">as a set of points grouped in lines or as a set of lines grouped in points  (pencils) (p.119). Correlations, which assign a point to each line and a  line to each point, map the plane in the former acceptation onto it in  the latter (and vice versa). Correlations are 'structure-preserving' in  the following sense: if f is a correlation and P, Q are two points on  line r, which meets line s on point X, then fer) and f(s) are two points  on line f(X), and f(P), f(Q) are two lines through fer). The suggestion  lies near at hand that the substance of geometrical statements about  collinear points and concurrent lines consists in what they say  concerning the net of incidence relations in which points and lines are  enmeshed, not in any information they might contain regarding the  intrinsic nature of points and lines as such. This standpoint was  strengthened when PlUcker showed that space need not be viewed as  composed of points and that one could also choose different kinds of  curves or surfaces for its ultimate cor.stituents.5 Depending on our  choice of fundamental elements, space will exhibit a different struc­ ture. What matters geometrically are these several structures, not  their embodiment in that unique entity, space. As we saw on pp.139ff.,  a structuralist view of geometry was quite clearly put forward in  Klein's Erlangen Programme. Though Klein himself was wary of  axiomatics (p.148), its development was certainly favoured by the  increasing popularity of his views, for, as we shall now see, an  axiomatic theory is most naturally suited to characterize an abstract  structure.  3.2.2 Why Are Axiomatic Theories Naturally Abstract?  By an indicative sentence I mean a sentence liable to be asserted, i.e.  used for stating a truth or a falsehood. Thus "Peter is five years old",  and "If Peter were older, I should be happy to let him drive my car",  are indicative sentences, while "Peter, for heaven's sake, will you  stop mixing your Molotov cocktails on my desk!" is not. In the rest of  this section, a sentence means always an indicative sentence. An  axiomatic theory is determined by a set of sentences, the axioms of  the theory. This set can be finite or infinite, but one must at any rate  be able, in principle, to tell whether a given sentence belongs to it or  not.6 The theory comprises all the sentences which are logical  consequences of its set of axioms. These are aptly called the theorems  of the theory. (Note that according to this definition every axiom is a </p><div id="pagenum"><p>theorem.) I shall now try to show that the very fact that axiomatic </p></div><div id="pagenum"><p>192 CHAPTER 3 </p></div><p id="page">theories are held together, so to speak, by the bonds of logical  consequence, implies that they are essentially abstract, in the sense  roughly sketched in the foregoing section and which I shall make  more precise below.  Instead of saying that axiomatic theories are abstract, one often  says that they are {annal, because they are concerned with form, not  with matter or content. But one must not confuse this meaning of  {annal, with that which opposes this word to in{onnal. Axiomatic  theories can be {onnalized, i.e. they can be expressed in a formal  style, usually in an artificial language, in which word formation and  sentence construction are subject to strict rules. The set of words and  the set of sentences of such a language must be computable (see Note  6). Artificial languages employed in the formalization of ax ioma tics  normally contain also a computable set of finite sequences of  sentences, called proofs, which, if the formalization is sound, are so  built that the last sentence or conclusion of a proof P is always a  logical consequence of a computable subset of the sentences in P,  called the premises of the proof. If all the premises of a proof P  belong to a set I, P is said to be a proof from I; its conclusion is  then provable {rom I. If a sentence S is provable from the formal­ ized version of the axioms of a theory, S obviously expresses a  theorem of the theory. The set of sentences provable in a given  artificial language from a given set of axioms is generally not  computable. In a sound formalization of a theory a sentence will be  provable from its axioms only if it is a theorem. On the other hand,  one cannot expect, as a rule, that all theorems will be thus provable.  Formality, as opposed to informality, is thus only an additional  convenience, while formality in the sense of abstractness is, I  contend, an essential feature of mathematical theories. Practically all  contemporary mathematical writings are formal or abstract but, thank  God, very few are formalized.  To prove my contention, I must elucidate the relation of logical  consequence. This is a relation between a sentence and a set of  sentences from which the former is said to follow. I do not know of  any satisfactory explication of logical consequence applicable to the  full range of sentences of a natural language. But here it will suffice to  consider a fragment of English (or of any other civilized language)  which contains all that is necessary for the statement of mathematical </p><div id="pagenum"><p>propositions. The smallest such fragment, if we give up all </p></div><div id="pagenum"><p>FOUNDATIONS 193 </p></div><p id="page">embellishments, turns out to be very poor indeed. We shall call  such a fragment m-English. Research done in the last hundred years  has given us a pretty good idea of what m-English must look like.  To avoid raising questions which would be out of place here, I shall  give a rather crude sketch of its main features. In order to rid mathe­ matical discourse of cumbersome circumlocutions and ambiguities, the  meagre provision of ordinary English pronouns is supplemented or  replaced in m-English by a computable set of symbols, known as  variables (usually letters with or without numerical indexes, such as  we use in mathematical statements throughout this book). All m­ English sentences are in the present indicative, unqualified by so­ called modalities. Sentences fall into two easily distinguished classes,  which we shall call basic and non-basic. There are also two classes of  basic sentences. A basic sentence of the first class, when asserted,  ascribes a property to an entity or a relation to an ordered n-tuple of  entities. A basic sentence of this class includes only two kinds of  expressions: n-place predicators (n 2: I), which, when the sentence is  asserted, signify the ascribed property or relation, and designators,  which when the sentence is asserted, denote the entity or entities to  which the ascription is made. Predicators and designators will  hereafter be called interpretable words. These include all variables.  All other interpretable words are called constants. We must dis­ tinguish between object variables and constants, which behave as  designators, and predicate variables and constants, which behave as  predicators. Object variables are usually all of a kind, but in some  contexts they can fall into several distinct classes. (Thus, in Hilbert's  Grundlagen we find point variables A, B, C, ... , line variables  a, b, c, . .. and plane variables a, /3, 'Y, ..• ) Predicate variables and  constants can be classified from two points of view: (i) first-order  predicate variables and constants stand for properties and relations of  objects; second-order predicate variables and constants stand for  properties and relations of properties or relations of objects, etc.; (ii)  first-degree predicate variables and constants (of each order) stand  for properties, nth degree predicate variables and constants (n> 1)  for n-ary relations. Variables of each kind are ordered by numbering  or by any other appropriate method (alphabetical order, etc.). A basic  sentence of the second class consists of two designators, separated by  the symbol '=' or one of its verbal equivalents (,is equal to', etc.). </p><div id="pagenum"><p>Such a sentence, when asserted, says that the entities denoted by </p></div><div id="pagenum"><p>194 CHAPTER 3 </p></div><p id="page">either designator are one and the same. The reader will note that' ='  is not an interpretable word. Non-interpretable words in m-English  are sometimes called logical words. Non-basic sentences are of two  kinds: truth-functional sentences and existential sentences. A  sentence S is truth-functional if its truth-value (true or false) is  univocally determined, according to a fixed rule, by the truth-value of  one or more sentences Sh"" Sn, distinct from S, called its  components. A sentence S is existential if it can be obtained from  some other sentence S' by (i) substituting a suitable variable x, which  does not occur in S', for every occurrence of a given interpretable  word in S'; (ii) prefixing the phrase 'there is an x such that' (which  we shall abbreviate (Ex». This phrase is called an existential  quantifier and is said to bind the variable x. The bound variable x  evidently behaves in the modified text of S' as a relative pronoun  referred to (Ex). Every sentence S stands in a definite relation to a  finite set of basic sentences which we call its base. If S is basic, its  base is {S}. If S is truth-functional, its base is the union of the bases  of its components. If S is existential, its base is the base of the  sentence S' obtained from it by (i) dropping the first existential  quantifier of Sand (ii) replacing all occurrences of the variable bound  by this quantifier by the first variable of the same kind which does not  occur in S.  The fragment of m-English obtained by eliminating all expressions  in which kth- or higher-order predicate variables occur (for some  fixed positive integer k) will be called kth-order English. A kth-order  axiomatic theory is the set of kth-order English logical consequences  of a computable set of kth-order English sentences. Much progress  has been made in the study of first-order theories.  Interpretable words are generally ambiguous. In order to make a  definite statement by asserting a sentence S, one must fix the entity  denoted by each designator in S, the property or relation ascribed by  each predicator in S and the domain of entities over which all bound  object variables are allowed to range. We take this domain to be  non-empty. If there are several types of object variables, a non-empty  domain of entities must be assigned to each type. Each such domain  must include the denotata of the object constants of the correspond­ ing type. This assignment fixes the range of every predicate variable.  Thus, if all object variables range over a domain D, first-order </p><div id="pagenum"><p>predicate variables of nth-degree range over all n-ary relations </p></div><div id="pagenum"><p>FOUNDATIONS 195 </p></div><p id="page">between elements of 0, etc. Such an assignment of meanings to the  interpretable words occurring in a set of sentences K will be called an  interpretation of K.7 Interpretations must be viable -that is, they  must assign to each word a meaning suited to its nature (third degree  predicators should signify ternary relations, etc.) -and consistent­ that is, each interpretable word must be assigned the same meaning  wherever it occurs in K. The study of these matters is greatly eased  by the assumption that every interpretation assigns a fixed denotation  in the appropriate domain to each m-English variable. Hereafter, we  assume that every interpretation fulfils these requirements. Let I be  an interpretation of a set of sentences K. Let 01 be the non-empty  domain assigned by I to the object variables of K (DJ can be  partitioned into several domains, one for each type of object vari­ able, as we observed above). If, on this interpretation, every sentence  of K is true, we say that I satisfies K or is a modelling of K, and we  call OJ a model of K. The reader should bear in mind, though, that a  given domain OJ is a model of a set of sentences K through its  association with a modelling 1. The same domain might afford a  different model when associated with another modelling.  We can now characterize logical consequence in m-English. A  sentence S is a logical consequence of a set of sentences K if, and  only if, every interpretation of K U{S} which satisfies K also satisfies  {S}. We use the abbreviation 'K ~ S' for 'sentence S is a logical  consequence of the set of sentences K'. It is clear that if K ~ Sand  K and S are consistently interpreted in any viable manner, S cannot  be false if every sentence in K is true.  We see at once why axiomatic theories are essentially abstract or  formal. Let K be the axioms of a theory T. Then S is a theorem of T  if and only if K ~ S. This relation does not depend on a particular  interpretation of K and S. Indeed, we can replace all interpretable  words in K and S by meaningless letters -as Aristotle did in his Prior  Analytics, the earliest extant study of logical consequence -and it will  still make sense to say that K ~ S. The mathematician who studies an  axiomatic theory need not worry about the referents of its sentences,  though he will probably find that a model of its axioms can be a good  guide in the search for theorems. The important thing is that, for  every conceivable interpretation of the theory, if the axioms are true,  then the theorems are also true. </p><div id="pagenum"><p>Since the relation K ~ S holds independently of any particular </p></div><div id="pagenum"><p>196 CHAPTER 3 </p></div><p id="page">interpretation of K and S, we may say that it holds for the unin­ terpreted sentences of K US, and that the study of axiomatic theories  is a study of uninterpreted sentences. But we must be very careful  not to confuse the uninterpreted sentences of a meaningful language,  such as m-English or an artificial language into which m-English  sentences might be translated, with the meaningless strings of  symbols of a so-called uninterpreted calculus. A calculus is simply  one of those artificial languages we mentioned on p.192, which have a  computable set of words and a computable set of sentences. A  calculus is said to be uninterpreted if no rules have been established  for ascertaining the meaning of its words or the truth value of its  sentences. Words and sentences are then nothing but strings of  marks, potentially significant only in the loosest sense. If an unin­ terpreted calculus has a computable set of proofs, the conclusions of  such proofs cannot be said to be logical consequences of their  premises. They might or might not be, depending on the rules even­ tually agreed upon for determining the truth-value of sentences. On  the other hand, an m-English sentence is not wholly devoid of sense,  even if its interpretable words have not been given an unambiguous  meaning or have been replaced by variables; just as a blank cheque  signed by me is not a meaningless piece of paper, even if I have not  named the beneficiary and have not written in the amount. Indeed, if  the theorems of an abstract axiomatic theory were nothing but the  provable strings of symbols of an uninterpreted calculus, mathemati­ cians would be a sad lot. Not only would they, according to this view,  spend the best time of their lives, that is, the time when they actually  work on formalized theories, scribbling meaningless inkmarks ac­ cording to fixed rules, but in their everyday professional work, in  which they reason informally yet rigorously from ordinary language  premises, they would be no better than a pack of fools who push  pieces of ordnance around trusting that 'in principle' some wise man  might understand their doings as moves in a strictly regulated game of  strategy.  Because the uninterpreted sentences of an axiomatic theory are not  meaningless, the variety of situations which they can describe when  interpreted is not unlimited. The following example ought to make  this clear. Let T be a first-order predicator of the third degree and let  small italics be object variables of the same type. Txyz says that </p><div id="pagenum"><p>x, y, z stand in relation T. We use the following abbreviations: if S is a </p></div><div id="pagenum"><p>FOUNDATIONS 197 </p></div><p id="page">sentence, IS is the negation of S, i.e. a sentence which is true if, and  only if, S is false; 'for all x' amounts to 'it is not the case that there  is an x such that it is not the case that' (i.e.I(Ex)I). We charac­ terize T by means of the following m-English sentences:  (i) For x, y, z, Txyz only if x'i y'i z'i x.  (ii) For all x, y, z, Txyz only if ,Tyzx.  (iii) For all x, y, z, w, if either Txyz or Tzxy or Tyzx, and either  Txwz or Tzxw or Twzx, and y'i w, then either Tyxw or Twyx or  Txwy.  (iv) For all x, y, if x'i y, there is a z such that Txzy.  (v) For all x, y, z, u, v, if x'i y'i z'i x, and ITxyz and ITzxy  and I Tyzx and Tyzu and Tzvx, there is a w such that Txwy and  either Tuvw or Twuv or Tvwu.  (vi) There is an x and a y and a z such that x'i y'i z'i x and  I Txyz and I Tzxy and I Tyzx.8  Sentences (i)-(iii) come true if the object variables range over the set of  integers and Txyz means "x < y < z or z < y < x". But on this inter­ pretation (iv) and (vi) are false -while (v) is trivially true just because  the interpretation does not satisfy (vi). The following interpretations  satisfy sentences (i)-(v): (a) object variables range over rational num­ bers, Txyz means that x < y < z or z < y < x; (b) object variables  range over instants, Txyz means that y occurs between x and z; (c)  object variables range over the points of a Euclidean plane, Txyz  means that x, y and z are collinear and y lies between x and z.  Interpretations (a) and (b) fail to satisfy (vi). On the other hand, (c) is a  modelling of the full set (i)-(vi). We obtain another modelling (c') if, in  (c), we substitute 'BL' for 'Euclidean'.  Our example shows that by adding new axioms which are not a  logical constquence of the others, we can narrow down the range of  interpretations which satisfy a theory. If this process were to lead us  eventually to a theory which had one and only one modelling, such a  theory would not be abstract, for it would characterize a unique  domain of objects. We shall see, however, that this requirement  cannot be satisfied. For greater precision, we restrict our discussion  to first-order theories. The results we are about to state do not apply  only to first-order axiomatic theories, as defined onp.194, but to any  set of first-order sentences that includes all its first-order logical  consequences. We call such a set a first-order theory in the extended </p><div id="pagenum"><p>sense. Let T be such a theory. Let Cr be the set of all constants </p></div><div id="pagenum"><p>198 CHAPTER 3 </p></div><p id="page">occurring in the sentences of T. Denote by T* the set of all first-order  English sentences whose constants belong to CT. Plainly T C T*. Let  II and 12 be two modellings of T; DI and Db the corresponding  models. II and 12 are said to be structurally equivalent if there exists a  bijective mapping f: DI ~ D2 such that a sentence of T* is true in II of  a collection of objects of DI if, and only if, it is true in 12 of their  respective images by r T is a categorical theory if any two model­ lings of T are structurally equivalent. If T is axiomatic and categori­ cal, we say that its axioms form a categorical system. Obviously, all  the models of a categorical theory T are exactly alike with regard to  the properties and relations characterized by T. Nevertheless, two  models of T can stand in sharp contrast because of other properties  and relations, which their respective objects exhibit, but which T, as  applied to these models, does not even mention. A categorical axiom  system will therefore specify a unique abstract structure of properties  and relations, but not a unique set of things in which that structure is  embodied. Obviously, non-categorical systems determine their  modellings even more loosely. As a matter of fact, all the more  important first-order theories of mathematics -namely, all those that  have an infinite model- are not categorical.  There is another sense of the word categorical, in which Peano's  axioms of arithmetic and Hilbert's axioms of geometry are indeed  categorical systems, as it is often said (see e.g. Kline, MT, p.1014;  however Kline's definition of categorical agrees better with our sense  of the word). We call this the classical or c-sense. An early charac­ terization of it will be found on pp.240f. In our own terms, we may  informally define it as follows: A first-order theory T is c-categorical  if (i) T is a specification of set theory and (ii) all modellings of T, in  which the predicates 'is a set' and 'is a member of' are assigned  their ordinary English meanings, are structurally equivalent.tO (i)  means that T includes set theory and characterizes a specific type of  sets (sets endowed with a specific 'structure'). (ii) implies that in all  relevant cases, 'set' and 'set-membership' must be understood in their  natural, naIve meaning. (ii) is, in fact, tantamount to treating the two  basic set-theoretical predicates in question as non-interpretable  words. Such was indeed at the turn of the century the favourite  approach to those predicates,11 but it was subsequently abandoned by  most mathematicians when the set-theoretical paradoxes created the </p><div id="pagenum"><p>impression that the naIve understanding of set and set-membership </p></div><div id="pagenum"><p>FOUNDATIONS 199 </p></div><p id="page">was not sufficiently precise for mathematical use. This led to the now  current practice of ax iomati zing set theory, whereby the permissible  interpretations of the set-theoretical predicates are characterized by  means of axioms in which they occur as undefined terms. The  axiomatic approach to set theory in its turn raises difficulties which  have, of late, become intolerable. But we cannot deal with them  here.12  Mathematicians do not claim that their theorems are true but that  they follow from their axioms. Some authors conclude from this that  every mathematical theory is hypothetical, as they say, since its truth  depends on the truth of its axioms, and the latter, they contend, are  not held to be true, but are put forward only as suppositions or  hypotheses. To judge the merits of this opinion one should bear in  mind the following remarks. Let S be a theorem of a theory with  axioms K. Mathematicians will state then that K F S. This statement  is a good deal stronger than what we would ordinarily call a hypo­ thetical statement. K F S does not say merely that S will come true if  a situation described by K. in some familiar acceptation of these  sentences, is fulfilled. K F S says that S is true in every interpretation  of K U{S} which satisfies K. This far-reaching claim is made by  mathematicians unconditionally, when they assert that K F S. On the  other hand, this claim would be trifling, if K is not true in any  interpretation. Consequently, though the mathem'atician who states  that S is a theorem which follows from K need not hold K to be true  in a particular interpretation, he ought to make sure, lest his statement  be pointless, that there is at least one modelling of K. This require­ ment is fulfilled by the more important mathematical theories if (i) the  set of natural numbers exists (ii) the conditional existential postulates  of ordinary axiomatic set theory are true, in their familiar English  meaning.13 Neither of these assumptions can be said to be beyond  every reasonable doubt. They may be viewed as the hypotheses  which lie at the foundation of mathematics. Yet it is not the truth of  mathematical theories, but rather their significance, that may be said  to rest on this hypothetical basis.  3.2.3 Stewart. Grassmann, PlUcker  The thesis that mathematical truths are hypothetical was held about a  century before the rise of modern axiomatics by the Scottish </p><div id="pagenum"><p>philosopher Dugald Stewart (1753-1828). Stewart's position was </p></div><div id="pagenum"><p>200 CHAPTER 3 </p></div><p id="page">motivated partly by the cogency of mathematical demonstrations,  partly by the fact that the theorems of geometry cannot be really true,  since the dimensionless points, widthless lines, etc., to which they  refer, are not actually found in nature.14 The theorems would be true,  however, if these entities existed.  In mathematics -he writes -the propositions which we demonstrate only assert a  connection between certain suppositions and certain consequences. Our reasonings.  therefore, in mathematics, are directed to an object essentially different from what we  have in view, in any other employment of our intellectual facuities -not to ascertain  truths with respect to actual existences, but to trace the logical filiation of  consequences which follow from an assumed hypothesis. If from this hypothesis we  reason with correctness, nothing, it is manifest, can be wanting to complete the  evidence of the result; as this result only asserts a necessary connection between the  supposition and the conclusion."  Stewart was one of the first writers to make this point so clearly. 16 On  the other hand, his discussion of this matter does not show any  awareness that mathematics, thus conceived, will per force be ab­ stract or formal.  In a tedious discussion of "mathematical axioms", Stewart denies  that these are the "foundation on which the science rests". This is  because he understands by axioms such generalities as Euclid pro­ posed under the name of common notions. "From these axioms -says  Stewart -it is impossible for human ingenuity to deduce a single  inference." He contrasts them with such genuine principles as "All  right angles are equal to one another", or Postulate 5, "which bear no  analogy to such barren truisms as these: -'things that are equal to  one and the same thing are equal to one another'; -etc. ,,\7 In Ste­ wart's opinion, the principles of geometry are not the axioms, but the  definitions. These he understands as hypotheses, which involve the  assumption that the defined entities exist.  A conception of mathematics as the study of abstract structures or  'forms' freely conceived by the human intellect and devoid of in­ tuitive contents was resolutely put forward by Hermann Grassmann  (1809-1877) in his Ausdehnungslehre (1844). Since geometry refers to  a given natural object, namely space, it does not belong to mathema­ tics. Nevertheless, there must be a branch of mathematics "which in a  purely abstract fashion generates laws similar to those which, in </p><div id="pagenum"><p>geometry, are bound to space" .18 That branch is the theory of </p></div><div id="pagenum"><p>FOUNDATIONS 201 </p></div><p id="page">extension developed in the book. This should provide a foundation  for geometry.  The specific principles of geometry must be based on our intuition  of space. These principles are correctly conceived if they jointly  express "the complete intuition of space" and if everyone among them  contributes something to his purpose. Earlier presentations of  geometry are defective, in part because they include principles which  do not express any fundamental intuition of space; in part because  they omit principles which do express such intuitions, and "which,  later on, when it becomes necessary to use them, must be tacitly  taken for granted",,9 Grassmann maintains that the following two  principles provide all that is required:  (I) Space is equally constituted in all places and in all directions, so  that equal constructions can be carried out in all places and in all  directions.  (II) Space is a system of the third level.  Principle II uses a technical term of the theory of extension and in  this way subordinates geometry to that theory. A system of the third  level (System dritter Stu/e) is an instance of what Riemann called a  three-dimensional continuous extended quantity.20 But Grassmann  assumes throughout that such a system is naturally endowed with the  structure described in his book, which is that of a 3-dimensional real  vector space, with the standard scalar product and the norm defined  thereby.21 If we understand third level systems in their full  Grassmannian sense, Principles 1 and II can only be satisfied by  Euclidean-space geometry, which was probably the only three­ dimensional geometry which Grassmann had ever heard of in 1844.  However, Grassmann's contention that these two principles actually do  provide a sufficient basis for geometry is very nearly true. There are, of  course, obscure points in the foundations of the theory of extension  itself. Thus, Veronese objects that it rests on an imprecise concept of  continuity.22 There is also the difficulty of explaining how the structure  of a third level system is embodied in space. Euclidean space can be  given the structure of a three-dimensional normed real vector space by  picking any point P to be the zero vector and choosing the tips of three  mutually perpendicular congruent segments drawn from P for defining  an orthonormal basis. 23 But this proposal makes sense only if we know  how to recognize straight, congruent, perpendicular segments. Other </p><div id="pagenum"><p>mathematicians, working on the axiomatic foundation of geometry, will </p></div><div id="pagenum"><p>202 CHAPTER 3 </p></div><p id="page">devote considerable efforts to the exact characterization of such  elementary concepts. Indeed, one might say that the major interest of  the axiomatic systems of Pasch, Hilbert, etc., lies precisely in this.  As far as I can see, Grassmann had no thought of associating the  formal or abstract nature of mathematics with the mathematician's  search for logical consequences of the principles assumed by him. His  contemporary, Julius Pliicker (1801-1868), saw, at any rate, a  connection between the scope of mathematical statements and the  methods of mathematical proof. It is not clear, however, whether he  considered this connection as a happy accident, an unexpected bonus,  so to speak, of the methods employed, or whether he understood that  abstractness and generality were of the very nature of the relations  between sentences which such methods were designed to prove.  PlUcker writes:  If we carry through the proof of a theorem concerning straight lines (using the letters a,  b, c, ... to designate linear forms in two variables for representing such lines), we have,  in fact, demonstrated an untold number of theorems. For if by the letters a, b, c, ... ,  we no longer designate linear expressions but any general function in two variables,  provided they are of the same degree, the conditional equations F(a, b, ... , m, n, ... ) =  o [which formulate the relations which hold between straight lines in the initial  hypothesis], as well as all the equations derived from them, retain their meaning. [ ... J  If we have such a proof-schema we may relate it to lines of any arbitrary order. [ ... J  We may therefore carryover every theorem in projective geometry to curves of any  arbitrary degree."  Every geometrical relation is to be viewed as the pictorial representation of an analytic  relation, which, irrespective of every interpretation, has its independent validity.2l  3.2.4 Geometrical Axiomatics before Pasch  The novelty of Pasch's approach to the axiomatic foundation of  geometry will be appreciated best by comparison with earlier efforts  in this direction. We shall consider a few examples in this section.  The most popular text-book of geometry in the 19th century and  perhaps the most successful mathematical best-seller ever was Legen­ dre's Elements de geometrie (1794), whose 37th French edition appeared  in 1854. Legendre simplified Euclid's list of principles considerably. The  earlier editions give definitions of geometry, extension. line, point, and  straight line, and five axioms, mostly of the kind that Dugald Stewart  said would never yield a single conclusion. On this slender basis, </p><div id="pagenum"><p>geometry can be built only with the aid of surreptitious assumptions. In </p></div><div id="pagenum"><p>FOUNDATIONS 203 </p></div><p id="page">fact, Legendre's work can be profitably used by teachers of logic as a  source-book of elegant, subtly fallacious arguments. Its showpiece is,  of course, the demonstration of the parallel postulate.26  Bernard Bolzano (1781-1848), the great Czech philosopher and  mathematician, published in 1804 a booklet on the foundations of  geometry, entitled Betrachtungen fiber einige Gegenstiinde der Ele­ mentargeometrie (Considerations on some objects of elementary  geometry). Bolzano's attitude is a far cry from Legendre's  complacency. In the preface, he states his conviction that no al­ legation of self-evidence can cancel the obligation of demonstrating a  proposition, unless it is perfectly clear that no such demonstration is  necessary and why it is not necessary (pp.IIf.). The book is divided  into two parts. In the first, he claims to prove the main propositions  about triangles and parallels while presupposing the "theory of the  straight line". The second part is an avowedly provisional and in­ complete presentation of the latter theory, which Bolzano considers  "the hardest subject in geometry" (p.X). His own treatment of it  rests on the following:  Principle. We do not have an idea a priori of any definite spatial thing. Consequently  several entirely equal spatial things must be possible, of which exactly the same  predicates are true. Therefore, if any spatial thing A is possible at a point a. a spatial  thing B. equal to A (B = A). must be possible at any other point b.'7  The sentence I have italicized may be taken for a statement of the  principle of homogeneity which, as we know, characterizes the  maximally symmetric spaces that many late 19th-century mathemati­ cians regarded as the proper subject-matter of geometry. (See p.184).  Bolzano's choice of this principle as the foundation of the theory of  the straight line and, hence, of all geometry bespeaks his sure grasp of  essentials. The theory he builds on it is less remarkable for the  cogency of its proofs than for the meticulous precision of its state­ ments. Today, we would allow many of these statements to stand  unproved, but Bolzano's contemporaries did not even take the trouble  of formulating them. The relation between two points Q and b is  analyzed into two factors: the distance ab from Q to b and the  direction D(a, b) from a toward b (§6). Bolzano demands a proof of  the fact the "the distance from a to b is equal to the distance from b  to a". but he confesses that he is as yet unable to supply one (§ 11). </p><div id="pagenum"><p>On the other hand, he claims to have proved that for any point a </p></div><div id="pagenum"><p>204 CHAPTER 3 </p></div><p id="page">there is one and only one point b which lies in a given direction and at  a given distance from a (§ 10). This implies that a three-point system  or triangle is uniquely determined by a point a, two directions from a  and two distances marked, respectively, along each of those direc­ tions (§ 18). The relation between two directions D(a, x) and D(a, y)  from the same point a is also analyzed into two factors: the angle  between D(a, x) and D(a, y) and the hal/-plane, determined by D(a, x)  on which D(a, y) lies (§ 13). These two factors are seen to correspond,  respectively, to the factors of distance and direction that determine  the relation between two points. Bolzano assumes without proof that  the angle between two directions does not depend on the order in  which they are taken (§ 14). Let D(a, x) be a direction and let D(a, y)  (~ D(a, x» be the only direction stemming from the same point a  which forms a given angle with D(a, x). D(a, x) and D(a, y) are then  said to be opposite directions (§ 15). This definition does not imply that  the direction opposite to a given direction is unique, for there might  be many different angles such that D(a, x) makes each with one and  only one direction (§ 16). Moreover, as Bolzano boldly points out, it  does not even imply that opposite directions exist, for it is conceiv­ able that every direction makes every given angle with several direc­ tions at a time (§24). However, according to him, the concept of  opposite directions furnishes the basis for a satisfactory definition of  the straight line if we grant one more assumpti'on. This can be  paraphrased as follows: If a, band c are three points and D(a, b) is  the same as D(a, c), then either D(b, a) is the same as D(b, c) and  D(c, a) is opposite to D(c, b), or D(b, a) is opposite to D(b, c) and  D(c, a) is the same as D(c, b); but if D(a, b) is opposite to D(a, c),  D(b, a) is the same as D(b, c) and D(c, a) is the same as D(c, b) (§24).  Bolzano contends that this assumption, like the two we mentioned  earlier (§§11, 14), can be proved without using the concept of straight  line.28 He defines: a point m lies between points a and b if D(m, a) is  opposite D(m, b); a straight line between two points a and b is an  object that contains all the points lying between a and b and no other  points (§26). It follows at once that any two points will determine a  straight line between them. Bolzano 'proves' that if a point c lies  between two points a and b, the straight line between a and c  together with that between c and b form the straight line between a  and b (§31). He fails to mention that c must be added to the former </p><div id="pagenum"><p>two lines to complete the latter. </p></div><div id="pagenum"><p>FOUNDATIONS 205 </p></div><p id="page">Part I of Bolzano's work, which he considered more perfect, is not  so interesting as Part II. It begins with definitions of equality  (Gleichheit) and similarity (Aehnlichkeit). Two spatial things are equal  if their determining elements are equal (§6). This is, of course, the  kind of equality that we usually call 'congruence'. It follows from  Part II, §18, that two triangles abc and a'b'c' are equal in Bolzano's  sense if sides ab and ac are equal to sides a'b' and a'c', respectively,  and angle bac is equal to angle b'a'c' (§14). Two spatial things are  similar if all predicates that can be attributed to one of them by  comparing its parts with one another, can also be attributed to the  other (§ 16). Bolzano argues that two things are similar if their deter­ mining elements are similar (§ 17). He introduces a principle that we  may call the principle of the relativity of distance: "No particular idea  of any definite distance, i.e. of the definite way how two points lie  outside each other, is given to us a priori" (§19). This principle is  certainly not a consequence of the principle of homogeneity that we  quoted on p.203, but it does look like a specification of the general  epistemological statement that Bolzano inserted in his formulation of  the latter principle: "We do not have an idea a priori of any definite  spatial thing". If Bolzano understood the relativity of distance as a  logical consequence of this statement he ought to have concluded also  that we have no particular idea of a definite angle, such as the angle  between two opposite directions, and his theory of the straight line  would have crumbled down. On the other hand, if the relativity of  distance is admitted as an independent principle, his theory of trian­ gles and parallels presupposes more than just the theory of the  straight line.  The relativity of distance is used by Bolzano to prove that two  triangles abc, a'b'c' are similar if angle bac equals angle b'a'c ' and  abfac = a'b'fa'c' (§21), and that in two similar triangles the angles  opposite to proportional sides are equal (§23). He also proves (using  § 14) that if m is a straight line and a is a point outside it there is one  and only one line through a that is perpendicular to m (§32). §§21, 23  and 32 are all that is required for proving the theorem of Pythagoras  (§37), which, as we know, is the keystone of plane Euclidean geom­ etry. Bolzano's proofs of the said three premises are defective but  they could be improved with the resources at his disposal. This can­ not surprise us, for the relativity of distance is essentially the same </p><div id="pagenum"><p>principle that John Wallis had used for proving Postulate 5 (p.44). </p></div><div id="pagenum"><p>206 CHAPTER 3 </p></div><p id="page">Staudt's Geometrie der Lage (1847) is often regarded as an im­ portant step towards a rigorous axiomatization of geometry. Though  the book is not an axiomatic treatise, von Staudt, who was intent on  making projective geometry into an autonomous science, independent  of measurement, carefully states a long list of spatial properties and  relations that he takes for granted, presumably because he thinks that  they are intuitively obvious. The essential topological assumptions  uncovered by Klein (1872b, 1874) remain unstated.29  In his Prinzipien der Geometrie (1851), Friedrich U eberweg (1826- 1871) breaks new ground by proposing to base Euclidean geometry on  the idea of rigid motion. This, as we saw in Section 3.1.2, is the  keystone of Helmholtz's foundational work. A similar standpoint  was adopted by Hoiiel and Meray and it ultimately underlies Peano's  treatment of congruence and Pieri's exact characterization of the  common groundwork of Euclidean and BL geometry. We shall  examine Ueberweg's axiom system in connection with his philoso­ phical views in Section 4.1.2. I wish to note here, however, that  U eberweg thought that Euclidean space was the only conceivable  three-dimensional manifold in which a figure can be moved rigidly,  that is, undeformed, from any place and in any direction. Helmholtz,  after reading Riemann and Beltrami, concluded that this feature is  shared also by the spaces of constant positive and negative Rieman­ nian curvature. Lie rigorously proved in the 1880's that no other  three-dimensional Riemannian manifolds possess this property.  Ueberweg's friend and pupil, the Belgian philosopher J. Delboeuf  (1831-1896) had rejected Ueberweg's characterization of Euclidean  space at an earlier date, in his ProUgomenes philosophiques a La  geometrie (1860). Geometry, he says, like every other science, must  be grounded on postulates or hypotheses, i.e. first truths, regarded as  objective, which state the fundamental qualities of its object.3o "The  objects of geometry are the determinations of space. We must there­ fore carefully analyse the contents of the notion of determination and  of the notion of space. The results of our analysis will be the premises  we are looking for. ,,31 The scientific concept of space, he adds, is that  of "an homogeneous receptacle", all of whole parts are endowed with  the same properties.32 The homogeneity of space has two aspects: (i)  "a definite portion of space can be carried anywhere in space"; (ii)  "the general properties of such a portion are independent of its </p><div id="pagenum"><p>magnitude." Ueberweg's axioms determine property (i) only. A </p></div><div id="pagenum"><p>FOUNDATIONS 207 </p></div><p id="page">manifold characterized by them, Delboeuf calls isogeneous. For it to  be homogeneous it must also possess property (ii). "It follows that  every determination of space, i.e. every figure, possesses two sorts of  properties: some, which are independent of the size (grandeur) of the  figure, belong properly to its shape (forme); [ ... J the others depend  only on its size and are common to it and every other quantity. [ ... J  The mutual independence of shape and size is the first postulate of  geometry.,,33 This is, in fact, the assumption that John Wallis substi­ tuted for Euclid's Postulate 5 (p.44). We have just seen that Bolzano  used an equivalent assumption for proving Pythagoras' theorem  without using that postulate (p.205). However, neither Delboeuf nor  his contemporaries were acquainted with the writings of Wallis and  Bolzano. We may, therefore, credit Delboeuf with the independent  discovery of the aforesaid remarkable characteristic of Euclidean  space. His use of it in the deductive construction of geometry is  unfortunately somewhat disappointing. He conceives of surfaces as  boundaries of spaces, lines as boundaries of surfaces and points as  boundaries of lines. A straight line is a homogeneous line. A plane is a  homogeneous surface. Such lines and surfaces are given together with  homogeneous space. 34 Delboeuf makes no further assumptions. Those  we have mentioned are perhaps strong enough, but one would have  wished that he had analyzed them somewhat more fully before  attempting to deduce from them the fundamental propositions of  geometry.  J. Hoilel (1823-1886), a French mathematician who devoted much  time to the translation of the sources of non-Euclidean geometry into  his language, wrote his Essai critique sur les principes fondamentaux  de la geometrie eLementaire (1867) "to show the superiority of Euclid  over most contemporary authors, in the exposition of the first prin­ ciples of geometry".35 The work consists of an annotated translation  of Book I of Euclid's Elements and an "Exposition of the first  principles of elementary geometry", which proposes a new axiom  system.36 Nine notes follow, some of them quite interesting. Though  Hoilel does not say so explicitly, it is clear that, to his mind, Euclid's  superiority over 19th-century writers lies mainly in the fact that he  counted Postulate 5 among the indemonstrable principles of  geometry. On this essential point, Euclid obviously sided with  Hoilet's favourite non-Euclidean authors, against Legendre and his </p><div id="pagenum"><p>school. </p></div><div id="pagenum"><p>208 CHAPTER 3 </p></div><p id="page">Geometry, says HOllel, is the study of a concrete magnitude, namely  extension (l'etendue), which affects our senses. The latter reveal to us  the fundamental properties of that particular kind of magnitude.  Among the many properties thus disclosed, some are so simple, so  easily verified, that people assimilate them to the abstract truths of  arithmetic, the general science of magnitude. From such properties,  stated in axioms, one can infer others, some of them no less evident  than the first, others more recondite. which can only be brought to  our attention by reasoning. These other properties are stated in  theorems. The division between axioms and theorems is, up to a  point, arbitrary. The number of axioms can also vary. The geometri­ cian should reduce them to a minimum and determine precisely how  each theorem depends on them. HOllel proposes four axioms. The  first three amount, I should say, to a precise statement of Ueberweg's  characterization of space (p.262). The fourth is equivalent to Euclid's  fifth postulate.  "Geometry -writes Hoiiel- is founded on the undefinable experi­ mental notion of solidity or invariability of figures" (Hoiiel, PFGE,  p.4l). A surface is the limit or boundary of two portions of space; the  boundary of two portions of surface is a line; the boundary of two  portions of line is a point. The object of geometry is the study of lines  and surfaces. A figure is any set of points, lines or surfaces consi­ dered as invariable as to shape. (Hoiiel, PFGE, p.42). HOllers four  aXIOms are:  (I) Three points suffice, in general, to fix the position of a figure in  space.  (II) There exists a line, called a straight line, whose position in  space is fixed completely by the position of any two of its points, and  which is such that every portion of this line is applied exactly on any  other portion as soon as the two portions have two points in common.  (III) There exists a surface such that a straight line which passes  through two of its points is entirely contained in it, and such that any  portion of this surface can be applied exactly on the surface itself,  either directly, or after inverting it by means of a half-rotation about  two of its points. This surface is the plane. (Two straight lines, on the  same plane, which do not meet even if indefinitely prolonged, are said  to be parallel.)  (IV) Through a given point, one can draw only one parallel to a </p><div id="pagenum"><p>given straight line. </p></div><div id="pagenum"><p>FOUNDATIONS 209 </p></div><p id="page">A few explanations clarify the language of Axiom III. But no further  assumptions are made. In a beautiful note, Rouel shows, following  Farkas Bolyai. that the concept and the existence of the straight  line and the plane can be established on a simpler basis. This is  provided by the concept of equal distance between pairs of points,  and the properties of the sphere, i.e. of the locus of points equidistant  from a given point. But no attempt is made to determine which of  these properties must be accepted as intuitively obvious, which  follow from them. (Rouel, PFGE, pp.71-73). Another note deals with  the idea of "geometrical movement" which underlies Axioms I-III.  This disregards the time required to perform the movement and is not  "more complex than the ideas of magnitude or extension" (loc. cit.,  p.70). Rouel fails to note that, if "geometry is founded on the [ ... ]  invariability of figures", geometric movement is not only indifferent to  time, but also to the path followed by the moving figure (See pp.159f.).  In an essay on "The role of experience in the exact sciences",  appended as Note I to the second edition of his book (1883), Rouel  treats geometry as an abstract deductive science, whose axioms are  satisfied to a good approximation by the standard empirical inter­ pretation. Such sciences are concerned with transformation laws of  phenomena which can be determined "exactly", that is to say, so well  that the remaining uncertainty is practically negligible. They consist  of two parts: one, based on observation and experience, gathers facts  and inductively derives the principles which are the foundations of  the science; the other "is just a branch of general logic", which  combines the principles in order "to deduce the representation of the  observed facts and to predict new facts". When dealing with this  combination of principles, one can ignore their experimental origin  and the relationship of their consequences to real facts. On the other  hand, it is important to verify whether the principles are mutually  compatible and whether they can be reduced to a smaller set. Rouel  defines an operation as the "act which transforms one phenomenon  into another". 37  To a succession of phenomena corresponds a combination of operations. In order to  apply logic to the combination of operations it is in no sense necessary to know their  real meaning and how they are performed. It is enough to have determined some  abstract properties of these operations, which we might call combinatory properties. An  abstract theory of the operations can be built on the sole consideration of these </p><div id="pagenum"><p>properties [, .. J. Operations can be simple, like the fundamental operations of algebra </p></div><div id="pagenum"><p>210 CHAPTER 3 </p></div><p id="page">[ .... J. In other cases, they are more complex: such are the constructions of geometry.'8  In these rational and abstract sciences it is essential to distinguish the hypotheses,  considered in themselves, which are a priori essentially arbitrary and are subject only  to the condition that 'they do not contradict each other; and the value of these  hypotheses, regarded with a view to applications. Every abstract science, founded upon  non-contradictory hypotheses and developed according to the rules of logic, is, in itself,  absolutely true.39  Paul Rossier, in his valuable survey of the history of geometrical  axioms, extols the "revolutionary character,,40 of Meray's Nouveaux  elements de geometrie (1874). Charles Meray (1835-1911) was a dis­ tinguished French mathematician, whose construction of the real  number system, published earlier than Weierstrass' and before  Dedekind and Cantor developed theirs, deserves indeed to be better  known. 41 His textbook of geometry, however, seems to me an  elaborate exposition of Hooet's ideas, which shows some improve­ ments, but does not break substantially new ground.  3.2.5 Moritz Pasch  The Lectures on Modern Geometry published by Moritz Pasch (1843- 1930) in 1882 are based on a course he taught from 1873.42 Pasch  regards geometry as "a part of natural science,,4\ whose successful  application in other parts of science and in practical life rests "ex­ clusively on the fact that geometrical concepts originally agreed  exactly with empirical objects".44 It distinguishes itself from other  parts of natural science because it obtains only very few concepts and  laws directly from experience. It aims at deriving from these by  purely deductive means, the laws of more complex phenomena. The  empirical foundation of geometry is described in the second edition of  Pasch's book (1926) as a nucleus (Kern) of concepts and propositions.  The nuclear concepts (Kernbegrijfe) refer to the shape, size and  reciprocal position of bodies. 45 These concepts are not defined, since  no definition could replace the exhibition of appropriate natural  objects (der Hinweis auf geeignete Naturgegenstiinde), which is the  only road to understanding such simple, irreducible notions.46 All  other geometrical concepts must be defined in terms of the nuclear  concepts or of previously defined concepts. The application of  geometrical concepts is liable to some uncertainty (Unsicherheit), "as  it happens with almost all the concepts which we have developed in </p><div id="pagenum"><p>order to grasp phenomena".47 The nuclear propositions (Kernsiitze) </p></div><div id="pagenum"><p>FOUNDATIONS 211 </p></div><p id="page">connect the nuclear concepts.48 Their geometrical contents "cannot be  grasped apart from the corresponding diagrams (Figuren). They state  what has been observed in certain very simple diagrams".49 Instead of  nuclear propositions, we shall, hereafter, say axioms. All other  geometrical propositions must be proved by the strictest deductive  methods. 50 Only those proofs are admissible in which every single  step is grounded upon previously established propositions and  definitions.51 All premises, without exception, must be stated expli­ citly, even if they look trifling (unscheinbar).52 Proved propositions  are called theorems (Lehrsiitze). "Everything that is needed to prove  the theorems must be recorded, without exception, in the axioms.,,5J  These must embody, therefore, the whole empirical material  elaborated by geometry, so that "after they are established it is no  longer necessary to resort to sense perceptions".54 "Theorems are not  founded (begriindet) on observations, but proved (bewiesen). Every  conclusion which occurs in a proof must find its confirmation in the  diagram, but it is not justified by the diagram, but by a definite earlier  proposition (or definition).,,55 Pasch clearly understands the im­ plications of these methodological demands:  If geometry is to be truly deductive, the process of inference must be independent in all  its parts from the meaning of the geometrical concepts, just as it must be independent  from the diagrams. All that need be considered are the relations between the  geometrical concepts, recorded in the propositions and definitions. In the course of  deduction it is both permitted and useful to bear in mind the meaning of the geometrical  concepts which occur in it, but it is not at all necessary. Indeed, when it actually  becomes necessary, this shows that there is a gap in the proof, and (if the gap cannot be  eliminated by modifying the argument) that the premises are too weak to support it.56  The empirically-grounded geometry deductively built by Pasch can  therefore become the prototype of an abstract science, which ignores  the origin of its principles and does not care about the applicability of  its conclusions. In a paper of 1917, Pasch calls this science hypo­ thetical geometry, because it rests on "hypothetical propositions",  which combine "hypothetical concepts". 57  The Lectures are concerned with the projective properties of  spatial figures. Undefined concepts are point, straight segment, flat  surface. A point is a body which cannot be divided within the limits  of observation. 58 Two points are joined by a segment, that is, a  straight path between them, which includes many other points within </p><div id="pagenum"><p>it. A flat surface is a limited surface, which contains many points and </p></div><div id="pagenum"><p>212 CHAPTER 3 </p></div><p id="page">segments (though not necessarily every segment joining two of its  points: a flat surface need not be convex). These concepts are  characterized by two sets of axioms. The straight line (Gerade) and  the plane (Ebene) are defined in terms of them. Pasch says that in  order not to impair the (empiricist) standpoint adopted by him he has  had to resort to the undefined concept of congruence in the definition  of coordinates.59 This is a relation between figures, that is, rigid  configurations of two or more points.  The fundamental relations between points and segments are  governed by the following nine axioms:60  (S I) Two points can always be joined by a unique segment. (The  segment joining points A and B is denoted by AB; A and B are its  endpoints).  (S II) Given a segment, one can always indicate a point which lies  within it.  (S III) If point C lies within segment AB, point A lies outside  segment BC.  (S IV) If point C lies within segment AB, every point of segment  AC is a point of segment AB.  (S V) If points C and D lie within segment AB and D lies outside  segment AC, D lies within segment BC.  (S VI) Given two points A and B, one can always choose a point C,  such that B lies within segment AC.  (S VII) If point B lies within segments AC and AD, then either  point C lies within segment AD or point D lies within segment AC.  (S VIII) If point B lies within segment AC and point A lies within  segment BD and if points C and D are joined by a segment, then A  and B lie within segment CD.  (S IX) Given two points A, B, one can always choose a third point  C such that none of the three points lies within the segment joining  the other two.  If points A, B, C are such that one of them lies within the segment  joining the other two, A, B, C are said to be collinear. If A, B, Care  collinear, C is said to lie on the line AB, which is then said to go  through C. Two lines are said to meet if there is a point which lies on  both.  The fundamental relation between points, segments and flat surfaces  are stated in the following four axioms.61 </p><div id="pagenum"><p>(E I) A flat surface can be laid thrcugh any three given points. (The </p></div><div id="pagenum"><p>FOUNDATIONS 213 </p></div><p id="page">points are then said to be contained in the fiat surface. Points  contained in a flat surface P are called points of P.)  (E II) If two points of a flat surface are joined by a segment, there  exists (existirt) a flat surface which contains every point of the  foregoing, and also contains this segment.  (E III) If two flat surfaces P, pi have a point in common, one can  indicate another point which is contained in a flat surface together  with every point of P and in another fiat surface together with every  point of P'.  (E IV) If A, B, C, D are points of a flat surface, and point Flies  within the segment AB, the line DF goes through a point of the  segment AC or through a point of the segment BC. (Though Pasch does  not say so, we must assume that A, Band C in E IV are non-collinear  points.)  If four points A, B, C, D are contained in a flat surface and A, Band C  are not collinear, D is said to lie on the plane ABC, which is called a plane  through D.  From a philosophical point of view, Pasch's most remarkable feat  is the introduction of the ideal elements of projective geometry using  only the ostensive concepts of point, segment and flat surface and the  empirically justifiable axioms Sand E. We cannot consider this in  detail, but I shall sketch Pasch's method.  Pasch proves the following theorem: Given four lines p, q, r, s, if  the pairs (p, q), (p, r), (p, s), (q, r), (q, s) are coplanar, but neither r  nor s lie on plane pq, then the pair (r, s) is also coplanar.52 Let (a, b)  be a pair of coplanar lines. A line c will be said to belong to the  bundle ab if c does not lie on plane ab but (a, b) and (b, c) are  coplanar, or if c does lie on plane ab and there is a fourth line d, not  on plane ab, such that (a, d), (b, d) and (c, d) are coplanar. The  foregoing theorem implies that if two lines g, h belong to bundle ab,  the pair (g, h) is coplanar, and the lines a, b belong to the bundle gh.  Consequently a bundle is determined by any pair of lines belonging to  it. If two lines of a bundle meet at a point A, all the lines in the bundle  meet at A. Moreover, every straight line through A belongs to that  bundle. We shall let A denote the bundle whose lines meet at point A.  There are bundles, however, whose lines do not meet. These will be  also denoted by capital letters, which, in this case, of course, do not  at the same time denote points. Pasch stipulates that the sentence </p><div id="pagenum"><p>"point S lies on line g" will be understood to mean the same as the </p></div><div id="pagenum"><p>214 CHAPTER 3 </p></div><p id="page">sentence "line g belongs to bundle S".63 Then, if S does not denote a  point in the proper sense of the word, it is said to denote an improper  point (uneigentlicher Punkt). A point S in this wider sense lies on a  plane P (and P goes through S), if S lies on a line which is contained  in P. Let A, B be two distinct points. Let AB denote the family or  'pencil' of planes through both A and B. C is said to be a point of  pencil AB if C is a point which lies on every plane of the pencil. AB  denotes also the line through A and B, if such a line exists. In that  case, the line AB is the intersection of all planes of pencil AB and  every plane in which line AB is contained belongs to this pencil.  There are, of course, pencils of planes which do not have a line in  common. Pasch stipulates that the sentence "point S lies on line AB"  will be understood to mean the same as "s is a point of pencil AB".64  Then, if AB does not denote a line in the proper sense, it is said to  denote an improper line. Obviously, any pair of proper or improper  points determines a line in this wider sense. A line is proper if one  point on it is proper. Let a, b, c, d be proper lines through a proper  point X. Using axioms Sand E, Pasch is able to define the familiar  relation 'lines a and b are separated by lines c and d' (p.390). He  proves that any four proper lines through a proper point can be  grouped in two pairs, one of which is separated by the other.  Consider now any set of four points A, B, C, D, on a (proper or  improper) line m. Let X be a proper point not on m. We say that  points A and B are separated by points C and D if the lines AX, BX  are separated by the lines CX, DX. It can be shown that this relation  does not depend on the choice of X. Pasch proves the following  theorem: If A, B, C, D are four points such that the lines BC and AD  meet, then the lines AC and BD meet and the lines AB and CD also  meet.6~ Since the lines and points concerned need not all be proper, A,  B, C, D might not be coplanar. Pasch stipulates, however, that the  sentence "point D belongs to plane ABC" will be understood to mean  the same as "lines AD and BC meet".66 If AD and BC are not actually  coplanar, ABC is said to denote an improper plane. It can be readily  shown that, if words are used in their new, extended sense, two  coplanar lines always meet. Also, every line meets every plane. Two  planes always have a common line; three planes, a common point.  The improper elements introduced by Pasch play exactly the same  role as the elements 'at infinity' of classical projective geometry. </p><div id="pagenum"><p>We turn now to Pasch's concept of congruence. Let a, b, c, ... </p></div><div id="pagenum"><p>FOUNDATIONS 215 </p></div><p id="page">denote proper points. Two pairs of proper points, ab, a'b', each  marked on a rigid body, are said to be congruent if we can place a on  a' so that b falls on b'; also if there is a point-pair a"b", marked on a  rigid body, which is congruent with both ab and a'b'. This intuitive  notion can be extended in an obvious way to figures of more than two  points. According to Pasch, the following statements are evidently  true of configurations of proper points marked on one or more rigid  bodies, when congruence is understood in the foregoing sense. They  are adopted as axioms of congruence.67  (K I) Figure ab is congruent with figure ba.  (K II) Given a figure abc, there is one, and only one, proper point  b', distinct from a, band c, such that ab is congruent with ab' and b'  lies within segment ac or c lies within segment ab'.  (K III) If c lies within segment ab and if figure abc is congruent  with figure a'b'c', then c' lies within segment a'b'.  (K IV) If c] lies within segment ab, there is an integer n ~ 1 and n  points C2, ••• , Cn+] on line ab, such that segment ac] is congruent with  segment CjCj+] (1 :5 i :5 n) and b lies within segment acn+]. (Axiom of  Archimedes ).  (K V) If segment ac is congruent with segment bc, figure abc is  congruent with figure bac.  (K VI) If two figures are congruent, their homologous parts are  congruent.  (K VII) If two figures are congruent with a third figure, they are  congruent with each other.  (K VIII) Given two congruent figures, if a point is added to one,  one can always add a point to the other in such a way that the  enlarged figures are congruent.  (K IX) Given two figures ab and fgh, such that ab is congruent  with fg and h does not lie on line fg, if F is any Oat surface with  contains a and b, there is a Oat surface G which contains F and  exactly two points c and d, such that the figures abc and abd are  congruent with fgh. There is, moreover, a point within segment cd  which lies on line abo  (K X) Two figures abcd and abce are not congruent unless all their  points are contained on the same flat surface.  Axiom K VI introduces the new undefined term homologous parts. Its  meaning is elucidated intuitively by Pasch: they are the parts which </p><div id="pagenum"><p>cover one another when two congruent figures are superposed. But </p></div><div id="pagenum"><p>216 CHAPTER 3 </p></div><p id="page">this elucidation is of no avail when drawing inferences from the  axioms. Our conclusions should depend only on what the axioms  themselves say. Now K VI, the only axiom where the term homolo­ gous parts occurs, does not really tell us much about them. It merely  says that, if two congruent figures do contain such parts (God knows  which!) as go by the name of "homologous parts", these parts are  congruent. Obviously, this will not do. Perhaps the following axiom  would serve Pasch's purpose better:  (K VI') If figure F is congruent with figure F', there is a bijective  mapping g: F ~ F' such that every figure contained in F is congruent  with its image by g.  Pasch's axioms of congruence were a useful contribution to the  analysis of congruence in Euclidean geometry, but their need in a  system of projective geometry is far from being obvious. Pasch says  that they enable him to introduce coordinates in a manner which does  not prejudice his empiricist standpoint. But I am afraid that empiri­ cism is inconsistent with the congruence axioms themselves, at least  with K VII. This implies that congruence is a transitive relation. But  one can easily produce a finite sequence of figures alb h  a2b2, ... ,anbn, such that aibi can be made to coincide with ai+lbi+l  (1 ~ i < n), within the limits of observation, though albl cannot be  made to coincide with anb n.  Axioms Sand E provide a foundation for von Staudt's construction  of the fourth harmonic to three given collinear points.68 Axioms K are  invoked to justify the assignment of homogeneous coordinates to  points of space after the manner of von Staudt and Klein (Section  2.3.9). The use of congruence axioms for this task is not quite  consonant with von Staudt's idea of projective geometry as a  measurement-free science. Pasch's argument is, on the other hand,  the first truly rigorous proof of Klein's contention that the assignment  of homogeneous coordinates does not depend on Euclid's parallel  postulate. Axioms K, and in particular the Archimedean axiom K IV,  enter essentially into the proof of a theorem on harmonic nets which  replaces Zeuthen's lemma (p.145) in Pasch's construction of pro­ jective coordinates.69 We defined harmonic nets on p.144. Three  (proper or improper) collinear points A, Bo, Bh determine the net  (ABoBI). We call Bo the zeroth and BI the first element of this net. The  nth element of (ABoBI) is defined as the fourth harmonic to AB n-1Bn-2 </p><div id="pagenum"><p>(n > 1). The theorem proved proved by Pasch can be stated thus: </p></div><div id="pagenum"><p>FOUNDATIONS 217 </p></div><p id="page">Let A, Bo, BI> P be collinear points. If A and B, are separated by Bo and P, there is a  positive integer n, such that the nth point of the harmonic set (ABoB,) is identical with  P or is separated by A and P from the (n + l)th point of the net Bn+" In this last case,  Bo and Bn+' are also separated by A and p.70  As we noted in p.145 Zeuthen's lemma follows from a postulate of  continuity. The same can be said of the above theorem. Pasch points  out that it is a consequence of the following axiom P, which can  therefore be substituted in his system for axioms K:  (P) Let Ao, B be two distinct points. There exists then (i) a sequence of points  AI> A2, Al, ••• within segment AoB, such that, for every positive integer i, Ai lies  between Ai-, and B; (ii) a point C of segment AoB (possibly identical with B), such that  no point of the sequence AI> A2, Al, ••• lies between C and B, and that, given any point  o within segment AoC, not every point of the sequence AI> Az, Al, ... lies between A  and D."  Pasch believes however that Axiom P cannot be justified; firstly,  because no empirical observation can refer to an infinite collection of  things, and, secondly, because we cannot assume that a segment  includes an infinite number of points, unless we broaden again the  meaning of point, making it even more remote from its original  intuitive sense.72  Pasch's empiricist standpoint has another interesting consequence.  Rational homogeneous coordinates provide numerical labels ("point­ formulae", Pasch calls them) for every point of space. Moreover, a  given assignment of such coordinates will label each point with more  than one equivalence class of rational number quadruples. This is due  to the fact that lines are not indefinitely divisible. There is a  threshold below which one cannot distinguish points on a line. This  can be stated more precisely thus: Let <l> denote a particular assign­ ment of rational homogeneous coordinates to the points of a line m  (according to the method of von Staudt-Klein-Pasch). If <l> assigns to  point P on m the pair of rational numbers (x, y) -or, as we shall say  for brevity, if (x, y) are <l>-coordinates of P, -there is a rational  number e > 0 (dependent on <l> and P) such that, if x' is any rational  number larger than x -e and smaller than x + e, (x', y) are <l>-coor­ dinates of P. Pasch acknowledges that these ideas are foreign to the  usual conception of geometry. It is essential, he says, to show how  the usual theory can be built upon the "empiricist infrastructure"  developed by him. Consider again the foregoing example. Let (Xi> X2) </p><div id="pagenum"><p>be <l>-coordinates of a point P on m. If XdX2 < gdg2 and (g\o g2) are </p></div><div id="pagenum"><p>218 CHAPTER 3 </p></div><p id="page"><P-coordinates of P, then (hI. h2) are also <P-coordinates of P  whenever XdX2 < hdh2 < gdg2. Pasch proposes the following stipula­ tion: if hI. h2 are any real numbers such that XdX2 < hdh2 < gdg2, we  shall regard (hI. h2) as <P-coordinates of a point P'.,e P, which ap­ proximately represents P. "We obtain thus a set of points which is  not only everywhere dense, but also continuous. We thus attain a  view of the straight line and its points which in the usual theory, i.e.  in mathematical geometry, is given, from the outset, as something  ready-made. While physical geometry need not discriminate between  certain point-formulae, such as (x], X2) and (hI. h2) in the example we  have just given, in mathematical geometry these are unconditionally  distinguished as so many 'mathematical' points.'>73  3.2.6 Giuseppe Peano  Giuseppe Peano (1858-1932) is known chiefly for the five axioms  which bear his name, and which provide the necessary and sufficient  foundation of the elementary theory of natural numbers. They were  published in 1889 in the artificial, canonical language invented by  Peano for the communication of mathematical ideas. About the same  time, he began working on the axiomatics of geometry. His contribu­ tions are contained in the pamphlet I principii di geometria logi­ camente esposti (1889) and in a long paper "Sui fondamenti della  geometria" (1894). The former expresses in Peano's artificial language  a set of axioms directly inspired by Pasch's axioms Sand E. They  constitute the groundwork of what Peano terms -borrowing Staudt's  phrase -geometria di posizione. Today we would call them axioms of  incidence and order. Peano derives some theorems, also in the  artificial language, and adds sixteen pages of explanations and com­ ments in Italian. In the paper of 1894, Peano reproduces the axioms  of 1889 in Italian translation and adds a set of axioms of congruence,  in fact, axioms of motion -motion being explicitly conceived by  Peano as a transformation of the set of all points.  Geometrical discourse -says Peano -includes two kinds of words:  geometrical words and words belonging to logic.74 Geometrical words  should be for the most part introduced through definitions, but it is, of  course, inevitable to leave some undefined. After listing these, one  should never use a geometrical word which has not been defined, di­</p><div id="pagenum"><p>rectly or indirectly, in terms of them. Logical words are innumerable </p></div><div id="pagenum"><p>FOUNDATIONS 219 </p></div><p id="page">in ordinary language, but Peano claims to have shown that they  can be reduced to very few. The chief advantage of his artificial  language is that it restricts the indispensable logical ingredient of  discourse to a very small set of unambiguous words and construc­ tions. It also enables us to codify the rules of inference, but this side  of the matter, though duly exploited by Peano, is not emphasized by  him in these works.  Peano agrees that the undefined terms of geometry must signify  some very simple ideas, common to all mankind.7s But this ordinary  meaning of the basic or, as Peano says, primitive concepts of  geometry is actually irrelevant to geometric theory. Thus, Peano's  geometric Axiom I says "Class 1 is not empty" ("1- = A"). If objects  a, b belong to class 1, ab denotes a subset of class 1 ("a, bEl. :::>  .ab E K I"). Class 1 is called in ordinary language, the class of  points; ab is called the segment determined by points a and b. But  geometric reasoning should not be influenced by the suggestions  contained in these words. It must rest entirely on the axioms which  determine the properties of the undefined objects of class 1 and of the  undefined relation e E ab (read "e belongs to segment ab" or "e lies  between a and b "). Peano drives this point home quite resolutely:  We are given thus a category of objects (enti) called points. These objects are not  defined. We consider a relation between three given points. This relation, noted c E ab,  is likewise undefined. The reader may understand by the sign 1 any category of objects  whatsoever, and by c E ab any relation between three objects of that category. [ ... J  The axioms will be satisfied or not, depending on the meaning assigned to the undefined  signs 1 and c E abo If a particular group of axioms is verified, all propositions deduced  from them will be true as well.76  Peano's "geometry of position" is based on seventeen axioms. The  first eleven agree essentially with Pasch's axioms S. Peano uses the  logical notions of negation, conjunction, disjunction, implication,  equivalence, existential generalization and identity, the set-theoretical  notions of belong to a set, being part of a set, the empty set, the union  and the intersection of two sets, the singleton {x}, i.e. the set whose  only element is the object x, and the two undefined geometrical  concepts mentioned above, namely, the class or set of all points, and  the point-set ab, determined by points a and b. My English version of  Axioms I-XVII follows the original text in the artificial language, </p><div id="pagenum"><p>rather than Peano's Italian translation.77 </p></div><div id="pagenum"><p>220 CHAPTER3 </p></div><p id="page">(P I) The class of points is not empty.  (P II) If a is a point, there is a point x which is not identical with a.  (P III) If a is a point, segment aa is empty.  (P IV) If a and b are distinct points, segment ab is not empty.  (P V) If a and b are points and c belongs to segment ab, c belongs  to segment ba.  Definition: Instead of saying that b belongs to segment ac (b E ac),  we say that c lies on ray a'b (c E a'b). "The ray a'b is, so to speak,  the shadow of b when illuminated from a." (Peano (1894), p. 56).  (P VI) If a and b are points, a does not belong to segment abo  (P VII) If a and b are distinct points, ray a'b is not empty.  (P VIII) If a and d are points, c E ad and b E ac, then bEad.  (P IX) If a and d are points, and bEad and e E ad, then either  b E ae or b = e or b E cd.  (P X) If a and b are points and e E a'b and dE a'b, then either  c = d or c E bd or dEbe.  (P XI) If a, b, c, d are points and b E ac and c E bd, then c E ad.  Definition: If a, b are distinct points, the line (ab) is the set b'a U  {a}Uab U{b}Ua'b. Three points are said to be collinear if they all  belong to a given line. (In other words: a point is collinear with two  distinct points if it is identical with one of them or if one of the three  points belongs to the segment determined by the other two.)  (P XII) If r is a line, there is a point x which does not belong to r.  (P XIII) If a, b, e are three non-collinear points, and dEbe and  e E ad there is a point f such that f E ae and e E bf.  (P XIV) If a, b, e are three non-collinear points and dEbe and  I E ae, there is a point e such that e E ad and e E bl.  Definition: A set of points is called a figure. If a is a point and k a  figure, ak denotes the set {x I x E ay, y E k}. Peano proves that if  a, b, e are three non-collinear points, a(bc) = b(ac). This set can  therefore be denoted by abc. It is called the triangle abc. If a is a  point and k a figure, a'k denotes the set {x I x E a'y, y E k}. (If  r is a line, a'r is the half-plane determined by r and a, and not  including a.) If b, e are points, a'(b'c) is the angle limited by rays a'e  and b'e. Let a, b, e be three non-collinear points. Plane (a, b, c) is the  union of segments ab, ae, be, rays a'b, b'a, a'c, e'a, b'e, e'b, triangle  abc, figures a'be, b'ea, e'ab, and angles a'b'e, b'e'a and e'a'b. Four  points are said to be coplanar if they belong to the same plane. (In other </p><div id="pagenum"><p>words, a point is coplanar with three distinct points if it is collinear with </p></div><div id="pagenum"><p>FOUNDATIONS 221 </p></div><p id="page">one of them and with a point collinear with the other two.) Peano proves  that if two distinct points a, b belong to a line r and to a plane p, r is  contained in p (Peano (1889), § 11, p.29).  (P XV) If h is a plane, there is a point a which does not belong to h.  (P XVI) If p is a plane, a a point not belonging to p and b E a'p,  then, if x is any point, either x E p or the intersection of p and ax is  not empty or the intersection of p and bx is not empty.  Definition: A figure k is said to be convex if every segment deter­ mined by a pair of points of k is contained in k.  (P XVII) If h is a convex figure, a and b are points, a E hand  b I h, there is a point x such that (i) either x = a or x E ab or x = b;  (ii) ax is contained in h; (iii) the intersection of bx and h is empty.  (P XVII implies that if a and b are points and k is a non-empty set of  points contained in ab, there is a point x belonging to {a} U ab U {b},  such that (i) k n xb = 0, (ii) for every point y E ax, k n yb ~ 0. To show  this, choose h = ak U{a}. P XVII postulates, therefore, the continuity  of the straight line).  A set of axioms is said to be independent if none of them is a logical  consequence of the others. If a set of axioms is not independent, you  can eliminate one or more axioms, and obtain a smaller set, which stilI  determines the same axiomatic theory. In his paper of 1894, after  reproducing P I-P XI, Peano remarks that the "first scientific ques­ tion" regarding them is whether they are independent or not. He  adds:  The independence of some postulates from others can be proved by means of examples  (esempi). The examples for proving the independence of the postulates are obtained by  assigning arbitrary meanings (dei significati afJatto qualunque) to the undefined signs. If  it is found that the basic signs, in this new meaning satisfy (soddisfino) a group of the  primitive propositions. but not all, it will follow that the latter are not necessary  consequences (conseguenze necessarie) of the former. [ ... J Hence, to prove the  independence of n postulates, it would be necessary to give n examples of inter­ pretation (essempi di interpretazione) of the undefined signs [ ... J, each of which  satisfies n -1 postulates, and not the remaining one.78  It is clear that, in 1894, Peano already understood the nature of  axiomatic theories in the manner explained in Section 3.2.2. He  proposes several interpretations of the undefined concepts of point  and segment which show that some of the first eleven axioms are not  a consequence of the others. He does not prove, however, the </p><div id="pagenum"><p>independence of the whole set. Let us mention three of Peano's </p></div><div id="pagenum"><p>222 CHAPTER 3 </p></div><p id="page">"examples". (1) If point means integer and c E ab means a < c < b, all  axioms P I-P XI are verified, except P IV. (2) If point means a real  number 01 the closed interval [0, 1], and c E ab means a < c < b, all  axioms P I-P XI are verified, except P VII. (3) Pick three lines  through a point P. Eliminate all points to the left of P. We obtain  three half-lines originating at P. Let point mean a point of any of  these half-lines. If c E ab means that c lies on the shortest way  leading from a to b over points in the agreed sense, all axioms  P I-P XI are verified, except P X.  Peano's axiomatic treatment of congruence depends on one more  set-theoretical notion, besides those listed on p.219: the concept of a  mapping (eorrispondenza). This, like all other set-theoretical ideas, is  viewed by Peano as a part of logic. Peano writes Ix for the value  assigned by the mapping I to an object x. He introduces a class of  mappings, called affinities, defined on the set of points characterized  by P I-P XVII. Let a and b be points. If I is an affinity and e E ab,  then Ie E (fa )(fb). P III implies then that affinities are injective. It can  be easily shown that affinities map collinear points on collinear points,  coplanar points on coplanar points. If I and g are affinities, the  composite mapping g . I is an affinity. The identity mapping x ~ x is  obviously an affinity. Let ab be a segment, I an affinity. Is I(ab)  identical with ttie segment (fa )(fb)? Peano declares that he does not  know the answer to this question. In other words, he does not know  whether the inverse mapping rl is an affinity, and he cannot say  whether affinities, in his sense of the word, form a group.  The idea of congruence is introduced through the axiomatic  characterization of a class of affinities, called motions. Two figures k,  k', are said to be congruent if there is a motion I such that k' = Ik.  There are eight axioms of motion. The last four can be summarized in  one, using the defined concepts of half-line and half-plane.  (M 1) The class of motions is contained in the class of affinities.  (Peano remarks that M 1 is equivalent to Pasch's Axiom K III.)  (M 2) The identity mapping is a motion.  (M 3) If I is a motion, the inverse mapping rl is a motion.  (M 4) If I and g are motions, the composite mapping g' I is a  motion.  Definition: Given two points a, b, the half-line Hl(a, b) is the set </p><div id="pagenum"><p>abU{b}Ua'b. Given three non-collinear points a,b,e, let r= </p></div><div id="pagenum"><p>FOUNDATIONS 223 </p></div><p id="page">HI(a, b) UHI(b, a); the half-plane Hp(ab, c) is the set {x I x E y'z,  y E r, z E cr}. (Remember that cr = {x I x E CW, w E r}.)  (M 5) If a, b, c are three non-collinear points and x, y, z are three  non-collinear points, there is a unique motion which maps a on x,  HI(a, b) onto HI(x, y), and Hp(ab, c) onto Hp(xy, z).  From these axioms, Peano derives some theorems concerning axial  symmetry and orthogonality, translations and rotations.  3.2.7 The Italian School. Pieri. Padoa  Peano's conception of ax iomati zed geometry as an abstract science  was shared in Italy in the 1890's, not only by the group of mathema­ ticians who collaborated with him in the formulation of all mathema­ tical theories in the artificial language, but also by others who did not  take part in this enterprise and even looked askance on it. H.  Freudenthal credits G. Fano with the first unambiguous statement of  the abstract view of geometry. In a paper of 1892 concerning the  postulates of n-dimensional linear geometry, Fano declares:  As a basis for our study we posit an arbitrary manifold of objects of any nature  whatsoever, which, for brevity, we shall call points, on the understanding, however,  that this name is independent of their own nature.79  As we saw above, Peano had said as much three years earlier (p.219,  reference 76), and it should not be too hard to discover other  statements of the same idea in contemporary Italian literature. Thus,  Giuseppe Veronese (1854-1917), in the historico-critical appendix to  his influential book Fondamenti di Geometria (1891), criticizes Pasch  for paying too much attention to the intuitive meaning of undefined  geometrical concepts. This forced him to distinguish quite un­ necessarily between proper and improper objects, though both have  the same geometrical properties, and led him to restrict the scope of  his axioms, so that they did not clash with the evidence of the senses.  Pasch, observes Veronese,  rightly maintains that proofs must be independent of the intuition of the figure, or  rather, as he understands it, of the sense representation of the figure. This aim,  however, cannot be fully attained [ ... J unless the axioms give us well-defined abstract  properties independently of intuition.S{)  Veronese demands that geometrical theories should be so conceived </p><div id="pagenum"><p>that, when intuition is disregarded, they become "a system of purely </p></div><div id="pagenum"><p>224 CHAPTER 3 </p></div><p id="page">abstract truths, in which the axioms play the role of well-determined  definitions or abstract hypotheses".81 A similar approach underlies the  Lezioni di geometria proiettiva, by Federico Enriques (1871-1946),  which circulated in lithographed form since 1894, and were issued in  print in 1898. The new view of geometry was made known to the  international philosophical community at the Paris Congress of 1900  by Peano's follower Mario Pieri (1860-1913), in a paper "On  geometry regarded as a purely logical system".  While Veronese and Enriques stressed the empirical origin of the  undefined concepts of geometry, and even Peano wrote that an  axiomatic theory deserves the name of geometry only if its postulates  state "the result of the simplest and most elementary observations of  physical figures" ,82 Pieri regards the connection of geometry with  experience as an inessential historical accident. He compares the  ordinary spatial representation of geometrical points and lines with  the medieval conception of negative integers as debts. 83 Geometry is  not more closely related to the study of bodily extension than  arithmetic is related to bookkeeping.  If you maintain that the postulates of geometry are nothing but rigorous formulations  of the intuitive concept of physical space (which merely impress stability and a seal of  rationality on the facts of spatial intuition), you ascribe, in my opinion, too much  importance to an objective representation, which you treat as a conditio sine qua non  of the very existence of geometry, whereas the latter can, in fact, very well subsist  without it. Today, geometry can exist independently of any particular interpretation of  its primitive concepts, just like arithmetic. 84  Indeed, after the work of Bolyai and Lobachevsky, one can no longer  expect geometrical axioms to be intuitively evident. "How could you  account for the intuitive evidence of the postulates proper to so­ called non-Euclidean geometries, after you have found Axiom XII on  parallels evident, or vice versa ?"S5 It is pointless to demand that the  primitive concepts of geometry be intuitively clear, since these ("with  the exception of the logical categories, which are necessary to all  discourse and consequently cannot be described by words") can be  given through "implicit definitions or logical descriptions [ ... ] or as  the roots of a system of simultaneous logical equations".86  For instance: we call, respectively, point and motion every determination of classes  nand M which have the following properties: ... (list here the premises concerning points </p><div id="pagenum"><p>and motions, denoted respectively, by nand M).87 </p></div><div id="pagenum"><p>FOUNDATIONS 225 </p></div><p id="page">Such a description conceals, in fact, a system of postulates. But since these, dressed as  definitions, amply exhibit their nature as conditional propositions concerning the primitive  concepts (i.e. their naturally arbitrary character, etc.), nobody will ask whether they are  self-evident or not. The postulates,like every conditional proposition, are neither true nor  false: they only express conditions which mayor may not be verified. Thus, the equation  (x + y)2 = x2 + 2xy + y2 is true if x, y denote real numbers, false if they denote  quaternions.88  Such is geometry as an "hypothetic doctrine", "la science de tout ce  qui est figurable", a "purely speculative and abstract system, whose  objects are pure creations of our minds and whose postulates are  simple acts of our Will".89  Before presenting his ideas on axiomatic geometry to the Paris  Congress, Pieri had shown how to carry them out, in two memoirs  submitted to the Academy of Sciences in Turin: "The principles of  the geometry of position, organized in a logico-deductive system"  (accepted for publication on December 19, 1897) and "On elementary  geometry as an hypothetico-deductive system" (accepted on May 14,  1899}.90 The former takes its cue from Staudt and Cayley, who tried to  build projective geometry as a science "independent of every other  mathematical or physical theory", unaided by "measurements per­ formed with transportable units in space".91 Pieri does not attempt to  conceal the thoroughly counterintuitive nature of this science, but  proposes to establish it firmly as "an hypothetical science, altogether  independent of intuition, not only in its method, but also in its  premises".92 Pieri assumes only two undefined concepts: the pro­ jective point, and the join of two points. These are combined in  nineteen axioms. In an appenqix, Pieri demonstrates what he calls the  "ordinal independence" of his axioms, that is to say, that the (n + l}th  axiom is not a logical consequence of the n axioms that precede it  (1 :S n < 19). Some of the. interpretations proposed in Pieri's in­ dependence proofs determine what are now generally known as finite  geometries, i.e. finite collections of objects which satisfy some typic­ ally geometrical axioms.93  Pieri's monograph on elementary geometry proposes a system of  twenty axioms, adequate to support the common groundwork of  Euclidean and BL geometry (i.e. Bolyai's scientia spatii absolute  vera). The addition of the parallel postulate or its negation suffices to  determine one or the other. Pieri defines every geometrical concept in </p><div id="pagenum"><p>terms of these two: point and motion. The first axioms characterize </p></div><div id="pagenum"><p>226 CHAPTER 3 </p></div><p id="page">the set of motions as a group of transformations acting transitively on  the set of points. Pieri's axiomatic reconstruction of elementary  geometry agrees thus with Klein's Erlangen Programme and follows  the lead of Helmholtz and Lie. But instead of relying on the familiar  attributes of the 'number manifold' R3, Pieri patiently analyses the  properties which must be ascribed to the class of mappings called  motions and to their domain, the set of points, in order to determine fully  and exactly the classical structure of geometry. Pieri points out that all  his axioms can be translated into Peano's artificial language, in which,  indeed, most of them were originally conceived.94  Besides Pieri's paper on geometry as a logical system, the Proceed­ ings of the First International Congress of Philosophy contain several  other articles on axiomatics by members of Peano's group. Peano  himself spoke about mathematical definitions, which, he said, "are  reducible to an identity, whose first member is the name to be defined,  while the other expresses its value".95 BuraH-Forti contrasted such  full-fledged nominal definitions, which determine concepts, with  "definitions by abstraction" and "definitions by postulates", which  yield intuitions.96 The former, he believed, are somehow superior to  the latter. He proposed a nominal definition of natural number in  purely set-theoretical terms, which essentially repeats, with less ele­ gance and clarity, Frege's feat of sixteen years before,97 a shocking  instance of the lack of communication between scientists of different  countries in the late 19th century. Alessandro Padoa (1868-1937)  presented an axiomatic theory of integers, preceded by a short  description of an "arbitrary deductive theory", which summarizes the  main ideas on axiom systems which we have met up to now and  advances a very important result on definability. Deductive theories,  says Padoa, must start from a system of undefined symbols combined  in a system of unproved propositions. We can imagine that the former  are "entirely devoid of meaning" and that the latter, "far from stating  facts, i.e. relations between the ideas represented by the undefined  symbols, are nothing but conditions with which the undefined  symbols must comply".98  It can happen that there are many (indeed infinitely many) interpretations of a system  of undefined symbols which verify the system of unproved propositions, and,  consequently, every proposition of a theory. The system of undefined symbols can be </p><div id="pagenum"><p>considered then as the abstraction of all these interpretations.99 </p></div><div id="pagenum"><p>FOUNDATIONS 227 </p></div><p id="page">Padoa discusses next the possibility of reducing the system of undefined  symbols or the system of unproved propositions of a theory without  changing the theory itself. The latter reduction can be achieved, as we  know, if one of the unproved propositions is a logical consequence of  the others. A system of unproved propositions is therefore irreducible  in Padoa's sense if, and only if, there is, for every proposition  belonging to it, "an interpretation of the system of undefined symbols  which verifies all the unproved propositions, except that one":oo On  the analogy of this procedure (due to Peano) for proving the ir­ reducibility or independence of axiom systems, Padoa puts forward a  novel method for proving the irreducibility of a system of undefined  symbols. Such a system can be reduced without modifying the theory  that rests on it if a definition of one of the symbols in terms of the  others can be inferred from the unproved propositions; that is, as  Padoa puts it, if "a relation of the form x = a, where x is one of the  undefined symbols and a is a sequence of other such symbols and  logical symbols"lol is a theorem of the theory. This kind of reduction  is impossible if, and only if, there are two interpretations of the  undefined symbols, both of which satisfy the unproved propositions,  differing only in the meaning assigned to the symbol x. In this case, if  a is as above, a will have the same meaning in both interpretations.  Since the meaning of x is not the same in both, x = a must be false in  at least one of the interpretations. Consequently, x = a cannot follow  from the unproved propositions of the theory. Padoa formulates this  important result as follows:  For demonstrating that the system of undefined symbols is irreducible relatively to the  system of unproved propositions it is necessary and sufficient to find. for each  undefined symbol, an interpretation of the system of undefined symbols which verifies  the system of unproved propositions and which continues to verify it if you suitably  change only the meaning of the symbol in question.102  3.2.8 Hilbert's Grundlagen  David Hilbert (1862-1943) chose a quotation from Kant as the epi­ graph for his Grundlagen der Geometrie:  All human knowledge begins with intuitions, proceeds to concepts, and ends up with  ideas.103  With this quotation, Hilbert did not mean to commit himself to </p><div id="pagenum"><p>Kant's philosophy of geometry. Quite on the contrary. He begins the </p></div><div id="pagenum"><p>228 CHAPTER 3 </p></div><p id="page">book by saying that geometry can be consistently built upon a few  simple principles, the axioms of geometry. By listing these axioms  and investigating their mutual connection, we perform "the logical  analysis of our spatial intuition" .104 Kant's authority is thus invoked to  justify a most un-Kantian deed, through which, as Hilbert sees it, we  proceed from spatial intuition to its logical, that is, copceptual analy­ sis, a task which Kant believed to be unfeasible (p.3l). Hilbert bids us  to conceive three different sets of things which we may call, respec­ tively, points, lines and planes. These things must be conceived as  standing in certain mutual relations, whose exact description is given  in the axioms of geometry. These relations are of five kinds: a binary  relation between points and lines, a binary relation between points  and planes (both expressed by the verb "to lie on"); a ternary relation  between points ("betweenness"); two binary relations between  different kinds of point-sets (congruence of segments, congruence of  angles). The axioms fall also into five groups, each of which "expres­ ses certain basic related facts of our intuition".105 The first three  groups characterize, respectively, the relations of incidence ("lying  on"), betweenness and congruence. The remaining axioms do not  introduce new relations, but state additional facts about points, lines  and planes, involving the relations we have mentioned. The only  axiom in group IV is equivalent to Euclid's Postulate 5. Axiom V 1 is  the postulate of Archimedes. Axiom V 2, the "axiom of complete­ ness", is somewhat peculiar and will be discussed later. For our  present purposes, it is enough to note that, taken jointly with the  axioms which it mentions, Axiom V 2 implies that the set of all points  lying on a given line is homeomorphic to R (assuming that, for every  pair of points A, B on that line, the set {X I X lies between A and B} is  open). If we grant that the points, lines and planes of classical  geometry are somehow intuitively given, the axioms of groups I, II  and III can be reasonably said to express the fundamental intuitive  facts of incidence, betweenness and congruence. But do the other  three axioms state "facts of intuition"? Not Axiom IV, if Proclus was  right. And certainly not Axiom V 2. As for the Archimedean Axiom  V 1, I wonder whether it is intuitively evident that the segment  spanned by the front feet of a gnat, standing on my nose, will, if  suitably multiplied by some positive integer, measure out the segment  between the gnat itself and Syrius.106 The full set of Hilbert's axioms </p><div id="pagenum"><p>offers therefore more than a mere analysis of spatial intuition. Now, </p></div><div id="pagenum"><p>FOUNDATIONS 229 </p></div><p id="page">the theory determined by the first three groups of axioms is not  categorical, not even in the classical sense (p.198). Consequently, if  spatial intuition is reflected by groups I-III only, it is not wholly  determinate and it cannot be the manifestation of a definite, unique  individual, as some passages of Kant suggest. On the other hand, as  noted on p.198, Hilbert's full set can be reformulated to yield a  c-categorical theory. This theory will unambiguously determine the  same abstract structure in every model of it furnished by an inter­ pretation in which 'set' and 'set membership' are understood in  their ordinary sense -in every standard model of it, as I shall say for  short -provided that such models exist and that the ordinary or naive  sense of the set-theoretical predicates is sufficiently precise to  determine anything at all. If one can meaningfully speak of the object  of Euclidean geometry, I know of no better candidate for this name  than that structure, viz. the unique global relational net that would be  discernible in every standard model of a c-categorical version of  Hilbert's theory if the two foregoing provisos are fulfilled. Every  proposition of Euclidean geometry could then be reasonably under­ stood in such way that it is true of that structure and every statement  which is true of it as such will be recognized as a proposition of  Euclidean geometry. Every Euclidean theorem is a logical  consequence of Hilbert's axioms. The latter can therefore be said to  provide an exhausitive conceptual analysis of the object of Euclidean  geometry. But such an object is not in any sense given in intuition. It  might be true, indeed, that we have come to think of it induced by its  local, partial, insecure embodiment in our familiar surroundings.  Euclidean geometry does indeed regulate our ordering and under­ standing of what we normally call the spatial features of experience,  and it fashions our environment through the commanding influence it  exerts upon carpenters and masons, architects and town planners.  The relations between certain basic patterns of human behaviour, the  articulation of perceptions in the adult mind and the abstract structure  deployed in Euclid's Elements constitute an important field of  philosophical and psychological research. This field, fruitfully  explored in our century by Husserl and Becker, Nicod and Piaget,  could not even be clearly conceived before the Euclidean structure  had itself been neatly isolated and characterized by Hilbert and his  predecessors. </p><div id="pagenum"><p>Hilbert's chief aim is not, like Pieri's, to exhibit the abstract nature </p></div><div id="pagenum"><p>230 CHAPTER 3 </p></div><p id="page">of geometrical knowledge, or to show that it can be fully expressed in  terms of a minimum of undefined notions; but, as he says, "to bring  out clearly the significance of the different axiom groups and the  scope of the inferences which can be drawn from the several  axioms."I07 This should provide "general information concerning the  axioms, presuppositions or resources required to prove a particular  elementary geometrical truth".108 Before considering some of Hil­ bert's findings on this matter, it will be useful to reproduce his axiom  system. As I noted above, Hilbert posits three different 'systems' of  objects (' System' being his German word for set): Points, denoted by  capital italics; lines, denoted by lower case italics, and planes,  denoted by lower case Greek letters. Planes and lines are not defined  as point sets. The relation of a point with the lines or planes on which  it is said to lie must therefore be taken as a primitive concept of  geometry, which cannot be simply equated with set-membership. This  approach is more faithful to Euclid -some will add: more faithful to  intuition -than Pieri's, but it really makes no difference. The fact is  that in classical geometry, lines and planes matter only in so far as  points are found to lie on them, and every statement about lines or  planes can be replaced by an equivalent statement concerning the sets  of their respective points. To have seen this clearly was an undoubted  merit of Peano and his school. Besides the two relations of incidence  or "lying on", Hilbert assumes, as I said, three more undefined  relations: betweenness, which is a ternary point relation, and two sorts  of congruence, which are binary relations between segments and  between angles, respectively. These are two kinds of sets which I  now define. In Hilbert's terminology, a finite set of points is called a  figure. A two-point figure is a segment (Strecke). If AB is any segment  (i.e. if A, B are two distinct points), the set {X I A lies between Band  X} is a ray (Halbstrahl) from A. A ray is an infinite set (by Axiom  II 1), all of whose points lie on the same line (I 1, II 1). The set formed  by two rays from the same point 0 is called an angle; 0 is the vertex  of the angle. I give below a literal translation of the axioms, as they  appear in the 7th edition, the last which Hilbert himself revised. The  comments in parenthesis after some of the axioms are mine. If point A  lies on line m, Hilbert says sometimes that A is a point of m and that  m goes through A or belongs together with (zusammengehort mit) A.  If A lies on two lines m, m', these are said to meet at A or to have A </p><div id="pagenum"><p>in common. Similar expressions are used to indicate that A lies on a </p></div><div id="pagenum"><p>FOUNDATIONS 231 </p></div><p id="page">plane a. Whenever Hilbert speaks of two, three or more objects, we  must understand that these objects are all distinct.  I. Axioms of Connection (Verkniipfung)  (I 1) If A, B are two points, there is always a line a which belongs  together with each of the points A, B.  (12) If A, B are two points, there is not more than one line which  belongs together with each of the points A, B.  (13) On a line there are always at least two points. There are at  least three points which do not lie on one line.  (14) If A, B, C are any three points which do not lie on the same  line, there is always a plane a which belongs together with each of  the three points A, B, e. On each plane there is always a point.  (I 5) If A, B, C are any three points which do not lie on the same  line, there is not more than one plane which belongs together with  each of the three points A, B, e.  (16) If two points A, B of a line a lie on a plane a, every point of a  lies on the plane a. (In this case, we say that line a lies on plane a,  etc.)  (17) If two planes a, (3 have a point A in common, they have at  least another point B in common.  (18) There are at least four points which do not lie on one plane.  II. Axioms of Order (Anordnung)  (II 1) If a point B lies between a point A and a point C, A, Band C  are three different points of a line, and B lies also between C and A.  (II 2) If A and C are two points, there is always at least one point  B on the line AC, such that C lies between A and B.  (II 3) Among any three points of a line there is not more than one  which lies between the other two. (Hilbert inserts at this point the  definition of segment. He adds that points A, B are called the  endpoints of segment AB. Every point between A and B is called a  point of AB and is said to lie within AB.)  (II 4) Let A, B, C be three points not on one line, and let a be a  line on the plane ABC which does not go through any of the points A,  B, e. If the line a goes through a point of the segment AB, it certainly  goes also through a point of the segment AC or through a point of the </p><div id="pagenum"><p>segment Be. (The axioms of order enable us to discern, on each line </p></div><div id="pagenum"><p>232 CHAPTER 3 </p></div><p id="page">m through a point A, two groups of points (besides A): the points  which lie on one side of A and the points which lie on the other side  of A. A lies between each point on one side and each point on the  other. The sides can be immediately identified by picking one point on  m, distinct from A. Likewise, we can distinguish on each plane a  which contains a line m, two groups of points, one on each side of m.  A point of m lies within every segment formed by a point of one side  and a point of the other side. The sides can be identified by picking a  point of a not on m).  III. Axioms of Congruence  (III 1) If A, B are two points on a line a and A' is a point on a line  a' (possibly identical with a). one can always find on a', on a  prescribed side of A', a point B' such that segment AB is congruent  with segment A'B'. In symbols: AB == A'B'.  (1112) If a segment A'B' and a segment A"B" are congruent with  the same segment AB, then segment A' B' is also congruent with  segment A"B". Briefly: if two segments are congruent with a third one,  they are congruent with each other.  (III 3) Let AB and BC be two segments without common points on  a liDe a, and let A'B' and B'C' be two segments without common  points on a line a' (possibly identical with a). If AB == A' B' and  BC == B'C', then, always, AC == A'C'. (The definition of angle is given  at this point. The angle formed by rays h, k is denoted by 4(h, k). Let  h comprise points on a line hi, k points on a line k'. We say that h is a  ray of h', etc. Rays h, k, plus their vertex divide the remaining points  on plane h'k' into two groups: those which lie on the same side of k'  as the points of h and on the same side of h' as the points of k are the  inner points of 4(h, k) and are said to lie inside this angle; the others  are its outer points and are said to lie outside it.)  (III 4) Let 4(h, k) be an angle in a plane a and let there be given a  line a' on a plane a' and a definite side of a' on a'. Let h' denote a ray  of line a' from a point 0'. There is then in plane a' one and only one  ray k' such that angle 4(h, k) is congruent with angle 4(h', k') and all  the inner points of angle 4(h', k') lie on the given side of a'. In symbols:  4(h, k) == 4(h', k'). Every angle is congruent with itself. (Let 4(h, k) be  an angle with vertex B. If A is a point of hand C is any point of k, 4(h, k)  will be denoted by 4ABC. Three points not on one line form a figure </p><div id="pagenum"><p>called a triangle.)I09 </p></div><div id="pagenum"><p>FOUNDATIONS 233 </p></div><p id="page">(III 5) If, for two triangles ABC and A'B'C', we have that AB ==  A'B', AC == A'C', 4BAC == 4B'A'C', then, always, 4ABC == 4A'B'C'.  IV. Axiom of Parallels  (Euclidean Axiom.) Let a be a line and A a point not on a. On the  plane determined by a and A there is at most one line which goes  through A and does not meet a. (Hilbert defines: two lines are parallel  if they lie on one plane and do not meet.)  V. Axioms of Continuity  (V 1) (Axiom of Measurement or Archimedean Axiom.) If AB and  CD are any segments, there is a positive integer (Anzahl) n, such  that, by successively copying CD n times from A on the ray through  B, you pass beyond B. (The meaning of this axiom will be clear to  everybody, though Hilbert employs in its formulation some expres­ sions which he has not defined and are not sufficiently characterized  by the axiom itself. To copy CD successively k times (k;;;,: 1) from A  on the ray through B is to find the unique point Ak of that ray, such  that Ak-1A k = CD, where Ak-I = A if k = 1, and is determined by the  aforesaid condition if k> 1 (on the uniqueness of Ak: Hilbert, GG,  p.15). You pass beyond B by successively copying CD n times from  A on the ray through B, if B lies between A and An.)  (V 2) (Axiom of Linear Completeness.) The system of points of a  line, with their relations of order and congruence, cannot be extended  in such a manner that the relations between the former elements, and  the fundamental properties of linear order and congruence which  follow from Axioms I-III and Axiom VI, are all preserved.l1O  My translation of V 2 badly needs a paraphrase. M. Kline (MT,  p.I013) gives the following: "The points of a line form a collection of  points which, satisfying Axioms I 1, 12, II, III and V I, cannot be  extended to a larger collection which continues to satisfy these  axioms". This sounds much better, but is not essentially clearer. What  does it mean to extend the collection of points on a line? In any given  interpretation of Hilbert's axioms, each object called line is asso­ ciated with a set of objects called points, which are said to lie on it.  To extend this set, one must change the interpretation. V 2 is thus  seen to differ substantially from the other axioms. Instead of stating  some new fact about incidence, betweenness or congruence or intro­</p><div id="pagenum"><p>ducing a new property of points, lines or planes, V 2 takes, so to </p></div><div id="pagenum"><p>234 CHAPTER 3 </p></div><p id="page">speak, a stand outside the axiom system and says something about its  relation to the sets of objects which might conceivably satisfy it. V 2  is what nowadays one would call a metatheoretical statement; though  one of a rather peculiar sort, since the theory with which it is  concerned includes Axiom V 2 itself. To show this, let me paraphrase  V 2 once more. Let H denote Hilbert's axiom system without V 2.  Every model of H includes many things called lines (I 1, 1 8). On each  such line and the set of points lying on it, H induces a structure which  we may call line geometry. This structure is determined by Axioms 13  (first sentence), II 1-3, III 1-3 and V 1, plus the following three  propositions which are theorems of H: (i) If A and B are points on  the line, there is a point C which lies between A and B; (ii) any four  points on the line can be labelled AI. A2, A3 and A4 in such way that  A2 and A3 lie between Al and A4, A2 lies between Al and A3 and A3  lies between A2 and A4; (iii) the point B' whose existence is postu­ lated in Axiom III 1 is unique. Let L designate this axiom system,  while L * designates the system obtained by adding V 2 to L. It is not  hard to find two interpretations I and I' such that (i) in I the set of  'points on the line' is a given set m, while in l' it is the set m U {z},  where z is some object not belonging to m; (ii) if u, v and w belong to  m, v 'lies between' u and w in I if, and only if, v 'lies between' u  and w in 1'; (iii) if t, u, v and w belong to m, {t, u} and {v, w} are  'congruent' in I if, and only if, they are 'congruent' in I'; (iv) I and  l' are modellings of L. Thus, for instance, one may take m to be the  field of rational numbers and z to be 7T and stipUlate that in both I  and I' 'v lies between u and w' means that u < v < wand '{t, u} is  congruent with {v. w}' means that It -ul = Iv -wi. Now. Axiom V 2  says in effect that two interpretations I and l' fulfilling conditions  (i)-(iii) cannot both be modellings of L *, even if they happen to be  modellings of L. The curious thing is that V 2 does not introduce any  new determination of congruence or betweenness that might preclude  two modellings of L satisfying (i)-(iii) from simultaneously satisfying  L *. V 2 merely declares that the addition of itself to axiom system L  restricts modellings in the stated manner. There is something highly  unsatisfactory about the inclusion of a statement of this kind in an  axiom system. Richard Baldus (1930) showed. however, that the full  import of Axiom V 2 is given by the following Cantorean axiom:  There exists a segment AoBo with the following property: If Aj, Bj is a sequence of </p><div id="pagenum"><p>point-pairs such that (i) for every positive integer n, An and Bn lie between An-I and </p></div><div id="pagenum"><p>FOUNDATIONS 235 </p></div><p id="page">Bn-" and (ii) for every positive integer n there is a positive integer m such that An and  Bn do not lie between Am and Bm, there exists a point X which lies between An and Bn  for every positive integer n. III  Though Hilbert says in the Grundlagen that the axioms of geometry  state "fundamental facts of our intuition", he took a very different  stance in his private correspondence. Shortly after the publication of  the Grundlagen, Gottlob Frege (1848-1925) had written to him:  I give the name of axioms to propositions which are true, but which are not demon­ strated, because their knowledge proceeds from a source which is not logical, which we  may call space intuition (Raumanschauung). The truth of the axioms implies of course  that they do not contradict each other. That needs no further proof. 1I2  Hilbert replied:  Since I began to think, to write and to lecture about these matters, I have always said  exactly the contrary. If the arbitrarily posited axioms do not contradict one another or  any of their consequences, they are true and the things defined by them exist. That is  for me the criterion of truth and existence. '13  We say that a set of sentences K is inconsistent if its logical  consequences include a sentence S and its negation IS (that is, if, for  some sentence S, both K F Sand KF IS). Otherwise K is said to be  consistent. We say that a set of sentences K is satisfiable if there  exists an interpretation which satisfies it, that is an interpretation in  which every sentence in K is true. Now, it is easy to see that a set of  sentences K is inconsistent if and only if it is not satisfiable, so that  consistency amounts indeed to existence and truth, as Hilbert main­ tained.114 However, if this is the true purport of Hilbert's contention,  it is not really opposed to Frege's. The consistency of a set of  sentences can generally be proved only by producing an inter­ pretation which satisfies it, that is, by showing that, on that inter­ pretation, every sentence of the set is true. Hence consistency,  though equivalent to truth and existence, cannot be properly said to  be their criterion, because we must normally infer consistency from  truth, not the other way around.  Consistency can be proved directly (i.e. without having to produce  a modelling) in certain cases which we now discuss. Let K be the set  of axioms of a theory soundly formalized within a calculus C, in  which negation can be expressed.1I5 We say that K, as formalized in  C, is syntactically inconsistent if every sentence in C is provable from </p><div id="pagenum"><p>K in C. Otherwise K (as formalized in C) is syntactically consistent. </p></div><div id="pagenum"><p>236 CHAPTER 3 </p></div><p id="page">Now, if the formalization of K in C is, as we shall say, semantically  complete, that is, if every logical consequence of K can be proved  from K in C, the syntactical consistency of K (as formalized in C) is a  necessary and sufficient condition of the consistency of K. It is  necessary, because if every sentence S in C can be proved from K in  C, both S and IS can be proved from K in C. Hence, since our  theory is soundly formalized, K 1= Sand K 1= IS. It is sufficient,  because if K is inconsistent, every modelling of K (that is, none at all)  satisfies any sentence S of C; i.e. K 1= S. Consequently, since our  formalization is semantically complete, S can be proved from K in C.  The consistency of a set of sentences K can therefore be established  without having to produce a modelling of K, by demonstrating the  syntactical consistency of K in a sound and semantically complete  formalization of the theory determined by K.116 We know, however,  that, if Peano's axiomatic arithmetic is consistent, neither it nor any  theory which contains it can be given a formalization which is both  sound and semantically complete (Godel, 1931). The consistency of  such theories can therefore be demonstrated only by producing a  modelling of them, that is, by showing that there exists, in fact, a set  of objects which, on a given interpretation, fulfils the theory.ll7  As a matter of fact, Hilbert proves the consistency of his axiom  system by proposing an interpretation which satisfies it, that is, a  modelling. He first constructs a modelling of what we have called H,  i.e. the system without the axiom of completeness. This is then easily  modified to yield a modelling of the full system. Hilbert's models are  numerical. The entities assigned to the object variables which occur  in the axioms are not such as you might meet in the street or point at  with your finger. They are objects we know of only in so far as they  are characterized by other mathematical theories. If these theories are  inconsistent, Hilbert's models of geometry are void. Hilbert proves  therefore only the relative consistency of his axiom system: it is  consistent if some other axiom system is consistent. Specifically, H is  consistent if the arithmetic of natural numbers is consistent; the full  Hilbert system is consistent if classical real analysis is consistent. In  later life, Hilbert devoted much effort to prove the consistency of  arithmetic directly, by constructing a sound, complete, syntactically  consistent formalization of it. Hilbert's project foundered on Godel's </p><div id="pagenum"><p>discovery of 1931. </p></div><div id="pagenum"><p>FOUNDATIONS 237 </p></div><p id="page">Let us sketch Hilbert's modelling of H. 0 will denote a set of real  numbers determined as follows: (i) 1 EO; (ii) if a, b E 0, b'1'-0, then  a + b, a -b, ab, a: b EO; (iii) if a EO, then VI + a2 EO. Plainly, all  elements of 0 belong to the countable set of algebraic numbers. We  interpret 'x is a point' to mean that x E 03 (i.e. x = (Xb X2, X3), where  Xj EO). A plane is understood to be any set of relations (UI: U2: U3: U4),  where Uj E 0 and u], U2 and U3 are not all zero. (x], X2, X3) lies on  (UI: U2: U3: U4) if UIXI + U2X2 + U3X3 + U4 = O. A line can be understood to  mean a pair of planes which have two points in common, or a set of  points which lie on two different planes. The interpretation of lying on  a line, betweenness and congruence is a fairly easy matter. If we  substitute R. for 0 in the foregoing description, we obtain a modelling  of Hilbert's full set of axioms. Hilbert observes that this is a model­ ling of the ordinary Cartesian geometry.  In the introduction to the first edition of his book, Hilbert said he  intended to give an independent system of axioms for geometry. This  declaration of intent was withdrawn in the second edition, after E.H.  Moore (1902) had shown how to derive one of the axioms from the  others. Hilbert demonstrates however the independence of the  strongest and most characteristic principles of classical geometry: not  only the axiom of parallels, but also the Archimedean axiom and  Axiom 1115 on the congruence of triangles. The independence of the  axiom of completeness evidently follows from the existence of the  above modelling of H, which does not satisfy that axiom.  As Peano had shown, in order to prove that a sentence S is  independent (i.e. is not a logical consequence) of a set of sentences K,  one must give a modelling of K U{-,S}. Thus, if K comprises Axioms  I, II, III and V and S is the parallel axiom IV, the familiar Beltrami­ Klein sphere (p.133; substitute 'sphere' for 'circle') is a model of  K U{-,S}. The following interpretation satisfies Axioms I,  II, IV, V and all axioms of congruence except III 5: Points are  elements of R3; lines, planes, lying on, betweenness and congruence  of angles are interpreted as is usual in analytic geometry. Two  segments AB, A'B' are congruent, as always, if they have the same  length, but the length of AB, where A = (at. a2, a3) and B = (bb b2, b3),  is defined as «al -bl + a2 -bZ)2 + (az -b2)2 + (a3 -b3)2)112.  Hilbert's model of non-Archimedean geometry (Axioms I, II, III, </p><div id="pagenum"><p>IV and the negation of V 1) is more far-fetched. Let O(t) denote the </p></div><div id="pagenum"><p>238 CHAPTER 3 </p></div><p id="page">set of all functions f: R -+ R which fulfil one of the following condi­ tions, for every t E R: (i) f(t) = t; (ii) for some g, hE O(t), f(t) =  g(t) + h(t) or f(t) = g(t) -h{t), or f{t) = g{t)h{t), or, provided that  h{t) "" 0 for all t E R, f(t) = g(t)/h(t); (iii) for some g E O(t), f(t) =  VI + (g(t)i. If f E n(t), / is an algebraic function on R. Consequently,  either / is identically zero, or f{t) = 0 for, at most, a finite set of  values of the argument t. In other words, unless f"'" 0, there is a real  number tf, such that t = tf is the largest solution of f(t) = O. For every  real number t > tf, f(t) is positive, in which case we shall say that / is  positive, or negative, in which case we shall say that / is negative. Let  flo h belong to n{t). We stipulate that /1> h if f1 -f2 is positive, and  that II < 12 if II -12 is negative. Let t denote the function t f-+ t; n, the  constant function t f-+ n (n a non-negative integer). By the above  stipulation, n < t, since, for sufficiently large values of t, n -t < 0  always. We obtain a modelling of non-Archimedean geometry by  substituting n(t) for 0 in our earlier description of Hilbert's model­ ling of H. We define as usual the length IABI of a segment AB by the  Pythagorean theorem. If 0, X, Yare respectively the points (0, 0, 0),  (1,0,0) and (t,0,0), there is no positive integer n such that nIOXI;;;.  IDyl.  The Archimedean axiom enters into Euclid's Elements as a  presupposition of the theory of proportions developed in Book V. We  saw on page 11 how Euclid, following Eudoxus, defined a linear  ordering on the set of ratios between magnitudes. If a and b are two  lengths, a < b implies that a/a> alb (Euclid, V, 8). Consequently,  for any two lengths such that a < b, there must exist positive integers  m, n, such that rna > na but rna";;; nb. Obviously m, n fulfil this  condition only if it is also fulfilled by n + I and n. But then (n + l)a ,,;;;  nb. Hence a,,;;; neb -a). This presupposes, however, that for any pair  of lengths (areas, volumes) a and d = b -a, there exists a positive  integer n such that nd ;;;. a.  In Chapter III of the Grundlagen, Hilbert builds a new theory of  proportions, which can be used to compare lengths and areas (but not  volumes) in the space determined by Axioms I-IV, without assuming  the Archimedean axiom V 1. This theory rests on an algebra of  segments, which is essentially the same as developed by Descartes in  his Geometrie (see Section 1.0.4). But, while Descartes bases the  construction of the product of two segments on the theory of propor­</p><div id="pagenum"><p>tions. via Euclid VI, 4, Hilbert shows that the uniqueness of the product </p></div><div id="pagenum"><p>FOUNDATIONS 239 </p></div><p id="page">is ensured by a special case of Pascal's theorem.1I8 He can therefore use  the product of two segments for defining proportions between lengths  (alb = a'lb' if and only if ab' = ba') and for proving Euclid VI, 4.  The Grundlagen contain also some very interesting investigations  concerning the significance of the theorems of Desargues and Pascal,  and the geometrical constructions which can be justified by Axioms  I-IV without involving the axioms of continuity. But a detailed dis­ cussion of these matters would be out of place here.  3.2.9 Geometrical Axiomatics after Hilbert  The two great questions raised and studied in Hilbert's Grundlagen  can be concisely formulated thus: to find out the simplest properties  and relations which suffice to determine the rich structures of  geometry, and to investigate which aspects of a given geometrical  structure depend on each of its determining properties and relations.  The publication of Hilbert's book stimulated many researchers to  probe deeper into these two questions. Among those who dealt with  the latter, I shall only mention Max Dehn (1878-1952), who studied  the effect of a joint denial of the axiom of parallels and the Archime­ dean axiom.1I9 He provides a modelling of Axioms I, II, III, which  does not satisfy Axiom IV, nor Axiom V 1. In this space, there are  infinite lines parallel120 to a line m through each point P outside it, yet  the three angles of every triangle add up to more than two right  angles. Dehn calls this system non-Legendrean geometry, because  Legendre's first theorem -the three angles of a triangle are equal to or  less than 1T' -does not hold in it. This theorem, which does not depend  on the axiom of parallels, cannot be proved without the Archimedean  axiom. Even more interesting perhaps is Dehn's semi-Euclidean  geometry. This is a modelling of Axioms I, II, III, where there are  infinite parallels to each line through every point outside it, but the  three angles of a triangle are equal to two right angles. Hence, the  latter proposition entails Euclid's fifth postulate only if it is asserted  jointly with the Archimedean axiom.  Oswald Veblen (1880-1960) published in 1904 "A system of axioms  for geometry" which has several important methodological features.  Undefined notions are point and a ternary relation of order between  points.12I Lines and planes are conceived as sets of points. Veblen's  twelve axioms include a (Euclidean) axiom of parallels and a topolo­</p><div id="pagenum"><p>gical axiom which implies the continuity of lines. Veblen proves the </p></div><div id="pagenum"><p>240 CHAPTER 3 </p></div><p id="page">independence of the system and carefully notes, beside each theorem,  the axioms on which it depends. He proves also that the system is  categorical, in the classical sense which I tried to make precise on  pp.198f. With the lines and planes of the space determined by his  axioms, Veblen constructs a projective space. Projective points are  line bundles, i.e. sets of sets of points of the original space; projective  lines are pencils of planes; etc. A parabolic metric is introduced in the  projective space after the manner of Cayley and Klein (Section 2.3.6).  This is used to define the congruence of angles and segments in the  original space. Since the parabolic metric can be specified in many  different ways, there appears to be something inherently arbitrary  about the Euclidean concept of congruence. Axioms I-XII, which  only speak of points and their order, completely determine the  structure of three-dimensional affine space, where through every  point outside a given line there goes one and only one parallel to that  line. These same axioms, however, will only determine the full  Euclidean structure when supplemented by the conventional choice  of a polarity on the 'plane at infinity' of the attached projective  space. Segments which are mutually congruent relatively to a polarity  !" are not congruent relatively to a different polarity!,'.  Earlier axiom systems could not be proved independent because  some of the axioms involved others in their very formulation. That is  why Pieri (1899a) could only prove the "ordinal independence" of his  system: no axiom belonging to it is a consequence of those that  precede it. Veblen overcomes this difficulty with a very simple and  elegant move: he formulates most of his axioms as conditional  statements, whose antecedents are entailed by other axioms. To see  how this works, consider a system of two axioms A, B, such that B is  not a consequence of A but A is involved in the formulation of B.  Substitute A ~ B for B. The new system is just as strong, since B is a  theorem of it. It is also independent: since B, by hypothesis, is not a  consequence of A, there exists a modelling of {A, ,B} in which,  evidently, A~B is false; on the other hand, every modelling of ,A  trivially satisfies A ~ B. (Where ~ signifies material implication.)  Veblen credits John Dewey with the expression "categorical axiom  system", though the idea can be traced back to E.V. Huntington.122  Veblen explains it as follows:  Inasmuch as the terms point and order are undefined one has a right [ ... J to apply the </p><div id="pagenum"><p>terms in connection with any class of objects of which the axioms are valid pro-</p></div><div id="pagenum"><p>FOUNDATIONS 241 </p></div><p id="page">positions. It is part of our purpose however to show that there is essentially only one  class of which the twelve axioms are valid. In more exact language, any two classes K  and K' of objects that satisfy the twelve axioms are capable of a one-to-one cor­ respondence such that if any three elements A, B, C of K are in the order ABC, the  corresponding elements of K' are also in the order ABC. Consequently, any proposition  which can be made in terms of points and order either is in contradiction with our  axioms or is equally true of all classes that verify our axioms. The validity of any  possible statement in these terms is therefore completely determined by the axioms;  and so any further axiom would have to be considered redundant (even were it not  deducible from the axioms by a finite number of syllogisms). Thus, if our axioms are  valid geometrical propositions, they are sufficient for the complete determination of  Euclidean geometry. A system of axioms such as we have described is called cate­ gorica/.123  Of course, all the modellings admitted by Veblen interpret  set-theoretical predicates in the same na'ive commonsense way. 'Is a  set' and 'is a member of' are not regarded as interpretable words.  The proof that the axiom system is categorical in this limited sense is  very easy. All models of the system can be charted globally into 1R,3 by  a Cartesian mapping. Let K, K' be two such models, or, as Veblen  puts it, "two classes that verify Axioms I-XII". Let f be a Cartesian  mapping of K, f' a Cartesian mapping of K'. Then, g = r1f' maps K'  bijectively onto K. If A, B, C E K' are in order ABC, g(A), g(B) and  g(C) are in order g(A)g(B)g(C).  The followin'g description of Veblen's method of defining  congruence complements our discussion of projective metrics  (Section 2.3.6). The set of all lines on a plane a which are coplanar  with a line m not on a is called a pencil. Two coplanar lines a, b  determine a pencil (ab). They also determine the set of lines {x I x is  the intersection of a plane through a and a plane through b}. The  union of this set and the pencil (ab) is called a bundle. If X and Y are  two bundles, through every point 0 of space there passes one line of  each bundle. If these lines are distinct, they determine a plane. The  set of all planes thus determined by two bundles is called a pencil of  planes. A bundle everyone of whose lines lies on a plane of a given  pencil of planes is said to be incident with this pencil. A bundle will  be called a projective point or p -point, a pencil of planes a p -line.  p-points incident with the same p-line are said to be collinear. A  p-point A and a p-line b determine the set of p-points {X I X is  collinear with A and with a p-point incident with b}. Such a set is </p><div id="pagenum"><p>called a p-plane. Any point of a p-plane is said to be incident with it. </p></div><div id="pagenum"><p>242 CHAPTER 3 </p></div><p id="page">p-points incident with the same p-plane are said to be coplanar. A  p-point is said to be proper if the lines belonging to it meet at a point.  A p-line or p-plane is proper if there is incident with it a proper  p-point. Veblen's Axioms I-XI (i.e. the full set, minus the axiom of  parallels) induce on the set of p-points the structure of three­ dimensional real projective space. The figure consisting of four  coplanar p-points, no three of which are collinear, and the six p-lines  incident with them by pairs, is called a complete quadrangle. The four  p-points are called the vertices, the six p-lines, the sides; two sides  not incident with the same vertex are said to be opposite. A p-point  incident with two opposite sides of a complete quadrangle is a  diagonal point of the quadrangle. If A and C are diagonal points of a  quadrangle, and Band D are the intersections of the remaining pairs  of opposite sides with the p-line AC, D is called the fourth harmonic  or harmonic conjugate of B with respect to A and C. (Cf. the  construction of the fourth harmonic to three given lines on p.143).  The p-points and p-lines of a p-plane constitute a polar system if they  are set in such a reciprocal one-to-one correspondence that to the  p-point (p-line) incident with any two p-lines (p-points) corresponds  the p-line (p-point) incident with the corresponding pair of p-points  (p-lines). Given a polar system on a plane a, we say that two p-lines  (p-points) of a are conjugate if one of them is incident with the  p-point (p-line) that corresponds to the other. A polar system is  elliptic if no element is self-conjugate. A collineation is a bijective  mapping of the set of p-points onto itself, which maps p-lines onto  p-lines. (Cf. Veblen's Definition 39 and Theorem 71). Let a be a  p-plane, A a p-point incident with a. The reflection (Aa) is the  collin eat ion that maps each p-point X on its fourth harmonic with  respect to A and the intersection of AX with a. A collineation which  maps every pair of conjugate elements of a polar system onto a pair  of conjugate elements of the system is said to leave the polar system  invariant. If we now assume the parallel axiom XII, we can easily  prove that there is one and only one improper p-plane, to which all  improper p-points belong. Let I denote an arbitrarily chosen polar  system of the improper p-plane. A proper p-plane a and a proper  p-line m are mutually perpendicular if their intersections with the  improper p-plane are a pair of corresponding elements of I. Two  intersecting proper p-lines are perpendicular if they meet the im­</p><div id="pagenum"><p>proper p-plane at conjugate p-points of I. A perpendicular reflection </p></div><div id="pagenum"><p>FOUNDATIONS 243 </p></div><p id="page">by a proper p-plane a is the reflection (Aa), where A is the p-point  which corresponds in I to the p-line a along which a meets the  improper p-plane. The set of all collineations which leave I invariant  is plainly a group, each of whose elements maps proper p-points on  proper p-points, proper p-lines onto proper p-lines. Call this group  G(I). Every proper p-point (i.e. every bundle of concurrent lines) A,  determines a unique ordinary point A*, where all lines of A meet. On  the other hand, every ordinary point determines a unique bundle or  proper p-point. Let i denote the bijection A ~ A *. Then {igi-I I g E  G(I)} is a group of bijective mappings of ordinary space onto itself,  which maps ordinary lines onto ordinary lines. Call it G*(I). The set  H*(I) = {ihi-I I h E G(I) and h is the product of a finite number of  reflections by proper p-planes} is evidently a subgroup of G*(I). We  define: Two angles are congruent if there is a mapping in G*(I) which  maps the sides of one onto the sides of the other. Two segments are  congruent if there is a mapping in H*(I) which maps one onto the  other. Hilbert's third group of axioms can be derived from Veblen's  Axioms I-XII and this definition of congruence.  Veblen remarks: "That the choice of I is arbitrary is one of the  important properties of space; one tends to overlook this if  congruence is introduced by axioms". (Veblen (1904), p.382n.). On the  other hand, one should not overlook that congruence is defined by  Veblen in terms of the two undefined concepts of point and be­ tweenness, plus the arbitrarily designated polar system I. As Tarski  observed in 1935, Euclidean congruence cannot be defined in terms of  point and betweenness alone (Tarski, LSM, p.306). The proof of this  result follows almost immediately, by Padoa's method, from Veblen's  own definition of congruence. If you change the polar system of the  improper p-plane denoted by I while you allow the primitives point  and between (or "are in order ABC") to retain their meaning, you  obtain two modellings of Veblen's system (with congruence) which  satisfy the conditions of Padoa's theorem (p.227).  "A set of postulates for abstract geometry" (1913) by Edward V.  Huntington (1874-1952) has, in part, a philosophical motivation. The  author, like Pasch and other empirically-minded mathematicians  before him, had some qualms about the construction of extension  from unextended points. He proposes an axiom system with two  undefined predicates, which, in the intended interpretation, mean "x </p><div id="pagenum"><p>is a sphere", "x contains y". The latter is characterized by the axioms </p></div><div id="pagenum"><p>244 CHAPTER 3 </p></div><p id="page">as an antisymmetric irreftexive binary relation.l24 Huntington's system  is not exactly a "geometry without points", since a sphere which  contains no sphere is called a point and behaves like one. But, as  Huntington remarks, there is nothing in this terminology "which  requires our 'points' to be small; for example, a perfectly good  geometry is presented by the class of all ordinary spheres whose  diameters are not less than one inch; the 'points' of this system are  simply the inch spheres".125 If A and B are points, the set {X I X is a  point and every sphere which contains A and B also contains X} is  called the segment [AB]. A and B are its endpoints. The line AB is the  union of [AB] and the sets {X I A belongs to [XB]} and {X I B belongs  to [AX]}. If A, B, C are points, the set {X I X is a point and every  sphere which contains A, Band C also contains X} is called the  triangle [ABC]. A triangle [ABC] determines three vertical extensions  like {X I X is a point and A belongs to the triangle [XBC]}, and three  lateral extensions like {X I X is a point and [AB] n [CX] is not empty}.  (The remaining extensions are defined by permuting A, B, C in these  two descriptions.) The union of [ABC] and its six extensions is the  plane ABC. A tetrahedron and a 3-space are defined analogously.  This method of definition can be extended to any number of dimen­ sions.  These definitions are very elegant. Things grow unpleasantly  complicated, however, when we come to the concept of congruence.  Its definition in Huntington's system depends essentially on the  properties of parallels. Moreover, not all the properties of congruence  follow from its definition: some depend on axioms, which look very  simple when stated in terms of congruence, but must sound horribly  complex in terms of spheres and inclusion. Two lines are parallel if  they are part of the same plane but have no point in common. Four  points A, B, C, D form a parallelogram with diagonals [AC] and [BD]  if AB is parallel to CD and BC is parallel to DA. A point M is the  midpoint of a segment [AB] (noted: M = mid AB) if [AB] is a diagonal  of a parallelogram and M belongs to [AB] and to the other diagonal. A  segment [AB] is a chord of a sphere S if S contains every ·point of  [AB], but no other point of the line AB. If the sphere S contains a  point 0 such that every pair of chords of S which simultaneously  include 0 are the diagonals of a parallelogram, 0 is a centre of S.  Huntington postulates that if one sphere has a centre, then every </p><div id="pagenum"><p>sphere which is not a point also has a centre. He does not bother to </p></div><div id="pagenum"><p>FOUNDATIONS 245 </p></div><p id="page">mention that a sphere does not have more than one centre, but this  follows easily from his Theorems 15 ("Through a given point there is  not more than one line parallel to a given line") and 17 ("A segment  cannot have more than one middle point"). These theorems depend  on rather strong axioms, which imply that every plane is both  Arguesian and Euclidean. With these elements, Huntington can pro­ ceed to define the congruence of segments. Two segments [AB] and  [CD] are congruent if, and only if, one of the following conditions is  satisfied: (Ia) If line AB = line CD, either [AB] = [CD] or mid AC =  mid BD or mid AD = mid BC. (1b) If AB is parallel to CD, ABCD is a  parallelogram with diagonals [AC] and [BD]. (2a) If [AB] and [CD]  have a common midpoint, that midpoint is the centre of a sphere of  which [AB] and [CD] are chords. (2b) If [AB] and [CD] have a  common endpoint, that endpoint is the centre of a sphere of which  [AB] and [CD] are radii (a segment is a radius of a sphere S if one of  its endpoints is the centre of S and the other is the endpoint of a  chord of S). (3) There exist two segments [OX], [OY] which are  mutually congruent by (2) and are congruent by (1) with [AB] and  [CD], respectively.  Huntington classifies his axioms into existence postulates, which  demand the existence of some entity satisfying certain conditions,  and general laws, which say that if such and such entities exist, then  such and such relations will hold between them. Except for postulate  E 1, which posits the existence of at least two distinct points, the  remaining existence postulates are conditional statements of the type  'if this exists, then that exists as well'. But then, Huntington's  general laws suffice to prove many existential theorems of this kind.  This explains perhaps why his classification has not been adopted by  other authors. By means of novel and ingenious models (which he  calls pseudogeometries), Huntington proves that the general laws are  independent of each other, while the existence postulates are in­ dependent of each other and of the general laws. The system's full  independence could be easily achieved by slight changes in wording,  but, the author observes, "such changes would tend to introduce  needless artificialities".126 The consistency of the system is proved by  constructing a numerical model, in which the spheres are the closed  balls in R3, with radius r ~ Ikl (k E R). Huntington stresses that, since k  need not be zero, "we may speak of a perfectly rigorous geometry in </p><div id="pagenum"><p>which the 'points', like the school-master's chalk-marks on the </p></div><div id="pagenum"><p>246 CHAPTER 3 </p></div><p id="page">blackboard, are of definite, finite size, and the 'lines' and 'planes' of  definite, finite thickness". 127 It should be noted, however, that  Huntington's finite points behave in everything like their classical  counterparts: there are indenumerably many of them in any segment,  any two of them determine a unique line, etc. Indeed, any line can be  endowed with the structure of a complete ordered field by arbitrarily  choosing a zero point and a unit point on it. There is, thus, some  unwitting mockery in Huntington's reference to school blackboards.  Let us finally mention that, like Veblen, Huntington makes a point of  showing that his axiom system is categorical (in the classical sense).  The reader has probably observed that Huntington's space of  spheres is partially ordered by the relation of inclusion or contain­ ment. If we agree to add to it a universal sphere U, which contains  every other sphere, and a void sphere V which is contained in every  other sphere, we can easily conceive Huntington's space as a  lattice.l28 But, though the idea of a lattice had been developed (under  a different name) by Dedekind in 1900, it went unnoticed until it was  independently rediscovered by Karl Menger and Garrett Birkhoff  some thirty years later. These authors immediately based on it a  revolutionary approach to the foundations of geometry.129 n-dimen­ sional projective and affine geometries can be entirely built in terms  of the lattice operations of joining and intersecting. Special postulates  differentiate projective from affine lattices. A similar foundation can  be provided for BL geometry, but not for Euclidean geometry. This  means that, in a definite sense, the latter is less simple than the  former.  We cannot study these matters here, but a few indications might  stimulate the reader's curiosity.13o We consider a domain of entities  called flats. We define two associative, commutative operations which  assign to every pair of flats A, B a flat An B called their meet and a  flat AU B called their join. There is a unique flat U such that, for  every flat A, An U = A and a unique flat V such that, for every flat A,  AUV = A. If AnB = A and AUB = B we say that A is a part of B  and write A ~ B. If A ~ B and A ~ B, A is a proper part of B (noted  A C B). A flat whose only proper part is V is called a point.131 Our  operations satisfy the "law of absorption",  AU(AnB) = An(AUB), (1) </p><div id="pagenum"><p>and the "law of intercalation": if P is a point and A and B are two </p></div><div id="pagenum"><p>FOUNDATIONS 247 </p></div><p id="page">fiats such that A!;;; B !;;; A UP, then B = A or B = A UP. Since the  operations are associative, it makes good sense to speak of the join  and the meet of more than two fiats. A finite set of points Ph' .. ,P n  is said to be independent if none of them is a part of the join of the  others. A fiat A has dimension n (dim A = n) if it is the join of n + 1  independent points. In particular: dim V = -1; if A is a point, dim A =  0; if dim A = 1, A is called a line; if dim A = 2, A is a plane; if  dim U = n, then any fiat with dimension n -1 is called a hyperplane. If  we now postulate that dim U is, in fact, equal to a given positive  integer n, we have almost everything we need to build the systems of  n-dimensional affine and projective geometry. The latter is fully  determined by the foregoing assumptions and the following projective  postulate:  PP. If H is a hyperplane and V = An H !;;; B !;;; A, then B = V or  B=A.  It follows that if dim A ;;;. 1 and H is any hyperplane, there  exists always a point P!;;; A nH. The projective postulate PP does not  hold in affine geometry, which is determined instead by this strong  version of the parallel postulate:  AP. If P, Q, R are independent points, there exists one and only  one fiat L such that R C L C (P U Q U R) and L n (P U Q) = V.  To show that BL geometry can also be founded upon lattice theory,  I shall define the basic concepts of betweenness, congruence of  segments and parallelism (in the sense of Lobachevsky) in terms of  point, line, meet and join. The reader should try to apply the  definitions to the Beltrami-Klein (BK) model of the BL plane (p.133),  in order to verify their propriety. (The BL plane, you will recall, is  represented in that model by the interior of a Euclidean circle which  we shall denote by Z. BL points are the points in the interior of Z; BL  lines are the chords of Z (minus their endpoints, which are not BL  points); two BL lines are parallel if their Euclidean extensions meet  on Z; two BL segments, PQ and P'Q' are congruent if the cross-ratio  of P, Q and the two endpoints of the chord PQ is equal to the  cross-ratio of P', Q' and the endpoints of the chord P'Q'.) We assume  the lattice-theoretical groundwork common to affine and projective  geometry, as explained above. Let points and lines be denoted  respectively by capital Romans and by small italics. P lies on m and  m goes through P if m n P = P and m UP = m. If m n n = V we say  that m and n do not meet. Three distinct lines ah a2, a3 form an </p><div id="pagenum"><p>asymptotic triangle if none of them meets any of the others and </p></div><div id="pagenum"><p>248 CHAPTER 3 </p></div><p id="page">through every point P on aj there goes a unique line p such that  p~aj pnaj=V=pnak (l~i, j, k~3; i~j~k~i). (In the BK  model, asymptotic triangles are triangles inscribed in the circle Z.) We  call p the asymptotic transversal through P. a is parallel to b if, and  only if, there exists a line c such that a, b, c form an asymptotic  triangle. Let P, Q, R be points on a line m. Q lies between P and R if,  and only if, given any asymptotic triangle abc such that an m = P  and b n m = R, every line through Q meets at least one of the sides of  abc. A segment PQ on a line a is congruent to a segment P'Q' on a  line a' if, and only if, one of the following two conditions is fulfilled:  (i) a is parallel to a I and both lines are parallel to the join of the  meets of the asymptotic transversals through P and P' and through Q  and Q'; (ii) a is not parallel to a I but they are both parallel to a line a"  on which there is a segment P"Q", which is congruent with PQ and  with P'Q'. (To see that Condition (i) is justified, consider the BK  model; let A and B be the endpoints of the chord a, A and C the  endpoints of the chord a'; denote by p* the meet of the asymptotic  transversals through P and pI; by Q* the meet of the asymptotic  transversals through Q and Q'. Since the chord determined by p* and  Q* is 'parallel' to both a and a', it must go through A; let it meet BC  at D. A, P, Q, B and A, P*, Q*, D are perspective from C; A, P*, Q*,  D and A, P', Q', C are perspective from B. Consequently, the  cross-ratios (P, Q; A, B) and (PI, Q'; A, C) are equal.) With the aid of  these definitions, we could formulate a set of axioms for BL  geometry, in a more or less cumbersome manner, as conditions  imposed on a lattice. Euclidean geometry, on the other hand, cannot  be built in this way, because Euclidean congruence cannot be defined  in terms of joins and meets alone. (See Tarski (1935), and our brief  reference on p.243.)  We have taken a glance at a very small sample of the rich and  varied literature of geometrical axiomatics. I32 Let me mention in  passing one further development which shows, like the one we have  just examined, that the classical structures of geometry can be made  to rest on a rather slender algebraic basis. I refer to the foundation of  geometry on the concept of reflection, which can be traced back to J.  Hjelmslev (1907), was completed for plane geometry by F. Bachmann  (1936, 1951), and was extended to space geometry by J. Ahrens  (1959).133 A different development, which has attracted the attention </p><div id="pagenum"><p>of philosophers, though it is a good deal more tedious and less </p></div><div id="pagenum"><p>FOUNDATIONS 249 </p></div><p id="page">beautiful than the aforesaid, goes under the name of elementary  geometry. It originated with A. Tarski (1951) and is concerned with  that part of Euclidean (or non-Euclidean) geometry "which can be  formulated and established without the help of any set-theoretical  devices".I34 Elementary geometry can be formalized in the first-order  predicate calculus, no predicator being specifically intended to signify  set-membership. Tarski showed that formalized elementary Euclidean  geometry is decidable. Subsequently, W. Schwabhauser (1956, 1959)  proved that it is also semantically complete, and that elementary BL  geometry is both complete and decidable.135  3.2.10 Axioms and Definitions. Frege's Criticism of Hilbert  We mentioned earlier that Dugald Stewart held that mathematical  theories are deductively built on definitions. A similar statement was  made later by Grassmann,l36 and, in the 1890's, specifically with  regard to geometry, by Georges Lechalas, who, with Auguste  Calinon, developed a "general geometry", embracing the three clas­ sical geometries of constant curvature.137 Pasch's axiomatics is quite  foreign to these views: a clear distinction is made between defined  and undefined notions, and all geometrical propositions can be  deduced from principles which state relations between the latter.  Hilbert faithfully follows Pasch's example in the formal set-up of the  Grundlagen, but he makes a few remarks which seem to line him up  with Stewart and Grassmann in this matter. The Axioms of groups II  and III are said to define (definieren), respectively, the concepts  between and congruent.138 As Frege was quick to notice, the idea that  axioms might define anything clashes with Hilbert's previous state­ ment that they express "fundamental facts of our intuition". If the  axioms express facts, they assert something. In order to do so, says  Frege, every expression which occurs in them must have a definite  meaning, fixed beforehand, instead of waiting to be defined by the  axioms themselves.139 In his letter to Frege of December 1899 (quoted  on p.235), Hilbert insists on his view of axioms as definitions. He is  even willing to change their name, and not call them axioms any  longer, though this would "conflict with the usage of mathematicians  and physicists" .140 The axioms, say, of group II could be brought into  a better agreement with the traditional style of definitions if we </p><div id="pagenum"><p>reformulated them thus: "Between is a relation connecting points of a </p></div><div id="pagenum"><p>250 CHAPTER 3 </p></div><p id="page">line, which has the following features: 111, ... , II 5".141 Frege coun­ tered that, even in this new version, Hilbert's axioms fail to render  the main service which we expect from a definition, since they do not  enable us to tell whether, or not, a given object falls under the  concepts allegedly defined by them.142 In order to know whether  something is a point, in Hilbert's sense, we must know already what is  meant by a line, what is meant by lying on, etc. However, if we allow  P, L, II, b, i!, i2, k], k2 to stand, respectively, for point, line, plane,  between, Hilbert's two kinds of incidence and his two kinds of  congruence, we may say that Hilbert's axioms do indeed define the  octuple (P, L, II, b, i], i2, k], k2). We can restate them to read: 'A  Euclidean 3-space is an 8-tuple (P, L, II, b, il> i2, kl> k2), where P, L  and II are sets, b is a relation on p3, i1 is a relation on P x L, i2 is a  relation on P x II, and k1 and kz are relations on such and such subsets  of (@>(p»2, which fulfil the conditions stated in Axioms I, ... , V'.143  Axioms I-V certainly enable us to tell whether a given octuple is, or  is not, a Euclidean 3-space, in this sense. Thus, Hilbert's numerical  model of Cartesian geometry (p.237) is such a space, but the octuple  (persons, cities, countries, is a child of, lives in, is a citizen of, got  married on the same day as, has the same life-expectancy as) is not.  There is, at any rate, one big difference between a 'definition' such as  the foregoing and the sentences which Hilbert actually calls by that  name, like "two lines are said to be parallel if they lie on the same  plane and do not meet each other". 144 The axiom system will not  enable us to substitute expressions built from known terms for the  unknown terms P, L, II, etc., which the system is supposed to define.  On the other hand, given Hilbert's definition of parallel, we can  eliminate this word from every sentence in which it occurs, by  substituting for it some phrase like coplanar non-intersecting, which,  in its turn, can be easily replaced by a more cumbersome phrase built  exclusively from P, L, II, it. i2, there is a ... such that, not, and.  Mario Pieri neatly expressed this difference by distinguishing nominal  and real definitions (definizione del nome, definizione di cosa ).145 A  nominal definition merely "imposes a name on something already  familiar", while a real definition lists a collection of properties which  suffice to characterize a concept for the purpose at hand. Hilbert's  definition of parallel belongs to the former kind; the 'definition' of  Euclidean space by the axiom system, to the latter. Following Peano, </p><div id="pagenum"><p>Pieri prefers to reserve the word definition to signify nominal </p></div><div id="pagenum"><p>FOUNDATIONS 251 </p></div><p id="page">definitions, and to say that a term is undefined when its meaning is  determined by an axiom system. Such is nowadays the ordinary usage  of logicians, which we have followed throughout this chapter. But,  although axiom systems are not really definitions in this strict sense,  this should not blind us to the fact that they do indeed determine  (and, hence, in the etymological sense of the word, they do de-fine or  de-limit) the undefined concepts which occur in them. To demand like  Frege that the meaning of these concepts be intuitively elucidated  (erliiutert)l46 shows a lack of understanding of the nature of logical  consequence that is indeed astonishing in the founder of modern  logic. Such elucidations are not only unnecessary, but altogether  pointless. The logical consequences of a set of axioms will not change  an iota because you replace a given elucidation of their undefined  terms by another, radically different from the first. As Hilbert put it,  in his reply to Frege:  Every theory is naturally only a scaffolding or schema of concepts, together with their  necessary mutual relations, and the basic elements (Grundelemente) can be conceived  in any way you wish. If I conceive my points as any system of things, e.g. the system  love, law, chimney-sweep, ... and I just assume all my axioms as relations between  these things, my theorems, e.g. the theorem of Pythagoras, will also hold of these  things. In other words, every theory can always be applied to infinitely many systems  of basic elements. It suffices to apply an invertible univocal transformation [i.e .• a  bijection] and to stipulate that the axioms hold correspondingly for the transformed  things. [ ... ] This property is never a shortcoming of a theory and is, in any case,  inevitable. 147  Frege's failure to understand abstract axiomatics comes out very  clearly in his criticism of Hilbert's independence proofs. He observes  that if the axiom system determines the meaning of the undefined  terms which occur in it, the elimination of one of the axioms will not  fail to alter that meaning. After suppressing, for instance, the Axiom  IV of parallels, we no longer stand before the same axiom groups I,  II, III and V, which, together with it, constituted Hilbert's system.  What remains is a set of statements which merely sound like the  axioms of those four groups, but do not say the same as they did.  Frege's obtuseness is truly baffling. If Hilbert's system does indeed  determine the meaning of (P, L, n, b, i .. i2, k .. k2) -which Frege is  willing to grant for the sake of the argument -two things can happen  when we cross out an axiom such as IV, that does not contain any </p><div id="pagenum"><p>basic term not occurring in the others: either the axiom we have </p></div><div id="pagenum"><p>252 CHAPTER 3 </p></div><p id="page">eliminated is a logical consequence of the others, in which case the  meaning of (P, L, ... , k2), i.e. the range of 8-tuples it may be taken to  stand for, is not altered; or the said axiom is independent of the  others, in which case the meaning of (P, L, ... ,k2) becomes less  specific, that is, the range of 8-tuples it may be allowed to represent  becomes wider. In neither case does the meaning of the remaining  axioms undergo a radical change. Indeed, we may say that their  contribution to the determination of (P, L, ... ,k2) will not be  modified by the addition and subsequent suppression of an in­ dependent axiom. Frege's resistance to admit this may have been  motivated by the seemingly enormous difference between, say,  Euclidean straight lines and BL 'straights', in the shape of, for  example, the semicircles centred on the edge of the Poincare half­ plane (p.136). But the fact that these semi-circles, in a suitable  interpretation of (P, L, ... ,k2), behave exactly like Euclidean lines  with regard to every logical consequence of Hilbert's Axioms I 1-3,  II, III and V, bespeaks a deep analogy between them, which can come  as a shock only to the mathematically uneducated. To maintain that  line means something entirely different in BL geometry and in Eucli­ dean geometry, is not more reasonable than to say that heart has a  completely different meaning in the anatomy and physiology of ele­ phants and in that of frogs.  For a long time, it was fashionable to describe axioms as implicit  definitions of the undefined or primitive terms which occur in them.  Mathematicians were seduced by the analogy with a system of  simultaneous equations which implicitly determines its roots.  However, this very analogy makes it advisable to avoid that descrip­ tion. For a system of n equations can be said to determine the n  unknowns XI. ... ,Xn which occur in them only if it can be solved for  them, i.e. if you can derive from it, through algebraic manipulation, a  set of n equations of the form Xi = t, where t is an expression in  which no unknown occurs. Our analogy would demand therefore that  axiom systems be 'solvable' for the primitive terms they contain; in  other words, that they yield ordinary nominal 'explicit' definitions of  them. But this is, of course, impossible.l48  Mario Pieri was one of the first to describe axioms as "implicit  definitions" and primitive terms as "the roots of a system of simul­ taneous logical equations" (see p.224f.). The phrase, however, and </p><div id="pagenum"><p>the algebraic analogy, had been introduced eighty years before -with </p></div><div id="pagenum"><p>FOUNDATIONS 253 </p></div><p id="page">a different purpose -by Gergonne. In his "Essai sur la theorie des  definitions" (1818), he propounds the rule, later defended by both  Peano and Frege, that all definitions should be nominal. "A definition  does merely establish an identity of meaning between two expres­ sions of the same aggregate of ideas, of which the simpler is new and  arbitrary, while the other, more complex one, is formulated in words  whose meaning is already fixed, either by usage or by a prior  convention.,,149 It is obviously impossible to define all words. How,  then, can one learn the meaning of those which must remain  undefined? Some words can be explained ostensively. Others, such as  those which express "a simple intellectual idea, such as desire, fear,  memory", or an "idea of relation, such as above, below, inside,  outside", can only be understood after "a long attentive observation  of the several circumstances in which the word is used by those who  know well its meaning" .150 Gergonne observes that a single sentence  which contains an unknown word may suffice to teach us its meaning.  Thus, if you know the words triangle and quadrilateral you will learn  the meaning of diagonal if you are told that "a quadrilateral has two  diagonals each of which divides it into two triangles".  Such phrases, which provide an understanding of one of the words which occurs in  them by means of the known meaning of the others, might be called implicit definitions,  in contrast with the ordinary definitions, which we would call explicit. There is  evidently between the latter and the former the same difference as between solved and  unsolved equations. One sees also that, just as two equations with two unknowns  simultaneously determine both, two sentences which contain two new words, combined  with other known words, can often determine their sense. The same can be said of a  greater number of words combined with known words in a like number of sentences;  but, in this case, one must per/amI a sort of elimination which becomes more difficult  as the number of words in question increases.I"  Gergonne has grasped well a familiar linguistic phenomenon and has  given it an appropriate name. But his systems of simultaneous implicit  definitions are something evidently very different from abstract axiom  systems. In these, all designators and predicators behave, if you wish,  as unknowns, and no process of elimination can lead to fix their  meanings, one by one. We ought not to burden Gergonne with the  paternity of the rather unfortunate description of axioms as implicit </p><div id="pagenum"><p>definitions. </p></div><div id="pagenum"><p>CHAPTER 4 </p></div><p id="page">EMPIRICISM, APRIORISM, CONVENTION ALISM  In the context of 19th-century physics, geometry was quite naturally  interpreted as the science of space, space itself being conceived as a  self -subsisting entity, no less real than the spatial things moving  across it. Paradoxically, however, the propositions of this science did  not seem to be liable to empirical corroboration or refutation. Since  the times of the Greeks, no geometer had ever thought of subjecting  his conclusions to the verdict of experiment. And philosophers, from  Plato to Kant, viewed geometry as the one unquestionable instance of  non-trivial a priori knowledge, i.e. knowledge relevant to things that  exist, yet not dependent on our experience of them. Even such an  extreme empiricist as Hume regarded geometry as a non-empirical  science, concerned not with matters of fact, but with relations of  ideas. The discovery of non-Euclidean geometries shattered the  unanimity of philosophers on this point. The existence of a variety of  equally consistent systems of geometry was immediately thought to  lend support to a different view of this science. The established  Euclidean system could now be regarded as a physical theory, highly  corroborated by experience, but liable to be eventually proved in­ exact. We have seen that Gauss and Lobachevsky, Riemann and  Helmholtz took this empiricist view of geometry.  In Part 4.1, we shall study two authors, John Stuart Mill and  Friedrich U eberweg, who developed an empiricist philosophy of  geometry before 1850, while still unacquainted with the new  geometrical discoveries. We deal next with the empiricist philoso­ phies of Benno Erdmann and Auguste Calinon, who were directly  influenced by non-Euclidean geometry. Finally, we take a look at the  novel viewpoints contributed by Ernst Mach to the empiricist  philosophy of geometry. We shall see that all these philosophies are  beset by one great difficulty, namely, that geometrical objects­ points, lines, etc. -are nowhere to be found in experience exactly as  geometry conceives them. Our authors did not overlook this difficulty.  Their persistent yet, in my opinion, unsuccessful struggle to over­ come it deserves our attention, because a similar difficulty is bound to </p><div id="pagenum"><p>254 </p></div><div id="pagenum"><p>EMPIRICISM, APRIORISM, CONVENTION ALISM 255 </p></div><p id="page">arise at some point within every empiricist epistemology, as long as  science includes and even clusters around mathematical physics.  Apriorists did not yield without resistance to the onslaught of the  new geometrical empiricism. Most of them dismissed non-Euclidean  geometry as a logically viable but physically meaningless intellectual  exercise, and sought the unshakeable foundation of established  geometry in a geometrical intuition which they believed was common  to all mankind. Apriorists were not alone in their rejection of the  physical and, consequently, the philosophical significance of the new  geometries, but were joined by some empiricists, who staunchly  defended the exclusive validity of Euclidean geometry. Together they  formed the chorus of Boeotians whose uproar Gauss anticipated and  tried not to arouse. Their philosophies are often handicapped by an  insufficient knowledge of geometry, new and old. In Part 4.2, we  study a small sample of these authors. This includes the well-known  philosophers Hermann Lotze, Wilhelm Wundt and Charles Renou­ vier, and the less well-known Joseph Delboeuf, whose opinions about  non-Euclidean geometry do not add much to those of the former  three, but whose views on the relationship between geometry and  reality are much bolder than theirs.  In Part 4.3, we examine the aprioristic philosophy of geometry  propounded by Bertrand Russell in 1897. Strongly influenced by Kant,  but making due allowance to the new developments, especially to the  findings of Helmholtz, Russell maintained that geometry must ascribe  a constant curvature to space, but that the actual value of this  curvature can only be determined by experience, According to him it is a  priori certain that physical space is maximally symmetric, but it is only  empirically likely that it is flat as well.  Part 4.4 is devoted to the philosophy of geometry of Henri Poin­ care. This great philosopher-scientist, hailed by historians of mathe­ matics as the last man to have a universal knowledge of this discipline  and its applications, refused to walk the trodden paths of apriorism  and empiricism and defended, in a series of articles published be­ tween 1889 and 1912, an entirely new view of geometry. According to  him, the principles of geometry cannot be true or false, because they  are conventions adopted for reasons of expediency. Poincare's  geometrical conventionalism is directly linked to his own mathemati­ cal researches, which led him to stress the mutual relations and the </p><div id="pagenum"><p>interchangeability of the several geometrical systems. We may regard </p></div><div id="pagenum"><p>256 CHAPTER 4 </p></div><p id="page">it, therefore, as the only philosophical conception which, in a sense,  actually arose from the new developments in geometry. Though  scientists and philosophers have generally rejected it, it has exerted  an unmistakable, sometimes openly acknowledged, more often barely  concealed, influence upon 20th-century epistemology.  4.1 EMPIRICISM IN GEOMETRY  4.1.1 John Stuart Mill  Gauss' discovery of BL geometry led him to think that geometry is an  empirical science. "The necessity of our geometry cannot be proved­ he wrote to Olbers in 1817 -at least neither by nor for our HUMAN  understanding [ ... J. We should class geometry not with arithmetic,  which stands purely a priori, but, say, with mechanics. ,,1 The British  philosopher John Stuart Mill (1806-1873), in his System of Logic of  1843, went even further, maintaining that all deductive sciences rest  upon inductive foundations, and that this applies not only to  geometry, but also to arithmetic.2 His almost solitary stance on  arithmetic has overshadowed his less exclusive philosophy of  geometry. The latter, however, is of some interest for us because,  though it was apparently developed in complete ignorance of non­ Euclidean geometry, it anticipates some of the tenets of latter-day  geometric empiricism.  Geometry is built by deduction or "ratiocination". This is identified  by Mill with syllogistic inference. The major premises of the syllo­ gisms of geometry are the axioms (these apparently include Euclid's  postulates) and some of the so-called definitions. "In those definitions  and axioms are laid down the whole of the marks, by an artful  combination of which men have been able to discover and prove all  that is proved in geometry.,,3 The main effort in geometrical proof  consists in finding the minors by means of which new, unforeseen  cases are subordinated to the definitions and axioms.  Mill is aware that from a definition as such, no proposition, unless  it be a proposition concerning the meaning of a word, can ever follow.  But the definitions which supply some of the major premises in  geometry involve existential assumptions, to wit, "that there exists a  real thing, conformable to the definition".4 Thus, Mill defines parallels </p><div id="pagenum"><p>as equidistant straight lines.5 This definition pressupposes that such </p></div><div id="pagenum"><p>EMPIRICISM, APRIORISM, CONVENTIONALISM 257 </p></div><p id="page">lines exist, i.e. that given a straight line you can find another line,  which is straight like the first, and all of whose points lie at a fixed  distance from it. Mill believes, however, that the existential assump­ tions of the definitions of geometry are actually false "There exist no  real things exactly conformable to the definitions. There exist no  points without magnitude; no lines without breadth, or perfectly  straight; no circles with all their radii exactly equal, nor squares with  all their angles perfectly right. ,,6 Mill denies that these geometric  objects are even possible: their existence would seem to be in­ consistent with the physical constitution of the universe. He also  rejects the interpretation which regards them as purely mental enti­ ties. Our ideas are copies of the things which we have met in our  experience. "Our idea of a point, I apprehend to be simply our idea of  the minimum visible, the smallest portion of surface which we can  see. A line, as defined by geometers, is wholly inconceivable."7 Mill,  on the other hand, will not admit that a science like geometry might  deal with non-entities. How does he reconcile this Platonic thesis with  his former remarks about the objects described by the definitions of  geometry? Not indeed after the fashion of Plato, by claiming that  these objects, because they are the concern of a genuine science,  possess some sort of being of their own. In Mill's opinion, the objects  characterized in the definitions are simply "such lines, angles, and  figures as really exist"8; only that in geometry we disregard all their  properties except the geometrical ones, and we even ignore the  "natural irregularities" in these. Mill says that his position is that of  Dugald Stewart, who maintained that geometry is built on hypo­ theses.9 But he remarks that the term hypothesis has here a somewhat  peculiar sense, meaning, not "a supposition not proved to be true, but  surmised to be so, because if true it would account for certain facts",  but a proposition "known not to be literally true, while as much of [it]  as is true is not hypothetical but certain". Indeed "the hypothetical  element in the definitions of geometry is the assumption that what is  very nearly true is exactly so. This unreal exactitude might be called a  fiction, as properly as an hypothesis".10 On the character of these  scientific fictions, which other writers have called idealizations, Mill  observes the following:  Since an hypothesis framed for the purpose of scientific inquiry must relate to  something which has real existence (for there can be no science respecting non-entities) </p><div id="pagenum"><p>it follows that any hypothesis we make respecting an object, to facilitate our study of </p></div><div id="pagenum"><p>258 CHAPTER 4 </p></div><p id="page">it, must not involve anything which is distinctly false, or repugnant to its real nature;  we must not ascribe to the thing any property which it has not; our liberty extends only  to *slightly exaggerating some of those which it has (by assuming it to be completely  what it is very nearly) and suppressing others*, under the indispensable obligation of  restoring them whenever, and in as far as, their presence or absence would make any  material difference in the truth of our conclusions. Of this nature, accordingly, are the  first principles involved in the definitions of geometry.ll  While definitions are simplifications or exaggerations of experience  and their existential presuppositions must be regarded as only ap­ proximately true, the axioms, Mill claims, "are true without any  mixture of hypothesis" .12 They are experimental truths, inductions  from the evidence of our senses. Some of them are common to  geometry and other sciences, e.g. that things which are equal to the  same thing are equal to one another. Others are peculiar to geometry.  Mill mentions the following two instances of the latter. Two straight  lines cannot enclose a space; two straight lines which intersect each  other cannot both be parallel to a third straight line. I3 It might seem  strange that propositions which speak about the very entities  described in the definitions should be regarded as "exactly and  literally true",14 while the latter are true, so to speak, cum grana salis.  Those who raise this objection, says Mill,  show themselves unfamiliar with a common and perfectly valid mode of inductive  proof; proof by approximation. Though experience furnishes us with no lines so  unimpeachably straight that two of them are incapable of inclosing the smallest space,  it presents us with gradations of lines possessing less and less either of breadth or of  flexure, of which series the straight line of the definition is the ideal limit. And  observation shows that just as much, and as nearly, as the straight lines of experience  approximate to having no breadth or flexure, so much and so nearly does the  space-inclosing power of any two of them approach to zero. The inference that if they  had no breadth or flexure at all, they would inclose no space at all, is a correct  inductive inference from these facts.'s  A different objection refers specifically to the axiom discussed in the  foregoing text:  That two straight lines cannot inclose a space, that after having once intersected, if  they are prolonged to infinity they do not meet, but continue to diverge from one  another. How can this, in any single case be proved from actual observation? We may  follow the lines to any distance we please, but we cannot follow them to infinity: for  aught our senses can testify, they may, immediately beyond the farthest point to which </p><div id="pagenum"><p>we have traced them, begin to approach, and at last meet.'· </p></div><div id="pagenum"><p>EMPIRICISM, APRIORISM, CONVENTION ALISM 259 </p></div><p id="page">Mill's answer to this objection deserves to be considered carefully. It  rests on a premise that we ought to rule out as psychologically naIve,  namely, that geometrical forms possess the "capacity of being painted  in the imagination with a distinctness equal to reality".17 But this  premise is not really essential. It serves him merely to avoid the  necessity of examining a real pair of intersecting straight lines in  order to conclude that they will not meet again. It is enough to  consider a pair of imaginary lines. Now, if the intersecting lines were  ever to meet a second time, they ought to begin to approach at some  point, after diverging from one another. Let us transport our minds to  this point and frame a mental image of the appearance which one or  both lines must present there. "Whether we fix our contemplation  upon this imaginary picture, or call to mind the generalizations we  have had occasion to make from former ocular observation, we learn  by the evidence of experience, that a line which, after diverging from  another straight line, begins to approach it, produces the impression  on our senses which we describe by the expression a bent line, not by  the expression a straight line. ,,18 The modern reader will see at once  that Mill's argument is not really based on the supposed exactitude of  geometrical images or on the "evidence of experience". In fact, he  argues from the accepted meaning of the expression a straight line,  which, we may grant, implies what he says. But if the axiom is true by  virtue of the meaning of the word straight, it is what Mill calls a  verbal proposition,19 not an induction from experience. And the  assumption that straight lines, in approximately that sense, actually  do exist is indeed an adventurous hypothesis.20  It is hard to understand why Mill insists in claiming that the axioms  have no admixture of hypothesis. After all, if the definitions or their  existential assumptions do not lack this admixture, and they are  indispensable in geometrical proof, the science derived from them  will be hypothetical throughout. That its propositions are nevertheless  usually regarded as necessary truths, says Mill, is only due to the fact  that they follow necessarily from the assumptions from which they  are derived. These assumptions are not themselves necessary, indeed  they are not even true, so that the necessity of geometrical theorems  is conditional or hypothetical: if the assumptions were true, the  theorems could not be false without contradiction. "I conceive -adds  Mill- that this is the only correct use of the word necessity in </p><div id="pagenum"><p>science; that nothing ought to be called necessary, the denial of </p></div><div id="pagenum"><p>260 CHAPTER 4 </p></div><p id="page">which would not be a contradiction in terms."Z! And at another place  he remarks: "This inquiry into the inferences which can be drawn  from assumptions, is what properly constitutes Demonstrative  Science".22  Geometry, thus conceived, is on a par with the physical sciences,  and ought to be counted as one of them. According to Mill, this has  not been acknowledged because of two facts. In the first place, the  truths of geometry can be gathered from our mental pictures as  effectually as from the objects themselves; this has induced men to  believe that geometry is concerned not with physical entities, but with  the objects of an internal intuition. In the second place, geometry can  be entirely deduced from a few obvious principles. But, says Mill, the  advance of knowledge has "made it manifest that physical science, in  its better understood branches, is quite as demonstrative as geometry  [ ... J the notion of the superior certainty of geometry being an illusion  arising from the ancient prejudice which, in that science, mistakes the  ideal data from which we reason, for a peculiar class of realities,  while the corresponding data of any deductive physical science are  recognised for what they really are, mere hypotheses".23  Mill is clearly a forerunner of the modern empiricists, who identify  geometrical necessity with the logical necessity of geometrical proofs,  while reducing the undemonstrated premises upon which those proofs  are built to the status of empirically verifiable and, if need be,  falsifiable hypotheses. But Mill does not seem to have thought that  those premises might be downright false. He still shares the old  unshaken faith in the irrevocable truth of Euclid.  Every theorem in geometry -he writes (and geometry means here, of course, Euclid's  geometry) -is a law of external nature, and might have been ascertained by generaliz­ ing from observation and experiment, which. in this case, resolve themselves into  comparison and measurement. But it was found practicable, and being practicable, was  desirable, to deduce these truths by ratiocination from a small number of general laws  of nature. the certainty and universality of which was obvious to the most careless  observer. and which compose the first principles and ultimate premises of the science.24  4.1.2 Friedrich Ueberweg  The Principles of Geometry, Scientifically Expounded, by Friedrich  Ueberweg (1826-1871), written in 1848, published in 1851, takes a  stance similar to Mill's on the nature and the foundations of </p><div id="pagenum"><p>geometry. Ueberweg has understood, however, that Euclid's axioms </p></div><div id="pagenum"><p>EMPIRICISM. APRIORISM. CONY ENTION ALISM 261 </p></div><p id="page">and postulates are not empirically evident, so that the empiricist  position on this matter must be made persuasive by substituting other,  really obvious, principles from which the former can be inferred. The  empirical facts which Ueberweg proposes as the foundation of  geometry clearly anticipate the axioms given by Helmholtz in 1866  (Section 3.1.2).  Ueberweg has explained the purpose of his work in two intro­ ductions.25 The first, written when the author was very young, is more  conciliatory towards the aprioristic philosophy of geometry which  prevailed in Germany at that time. He remarks, however, that before  setting up an aprioristic deduction of the principles of geometry from  the essence of space, one must derive those principles from a  concrete, empirical intuition (Anschauung); because, even if space is  a priori, at no time in our lives are we aware of the pure intuition of  space, unless we manage to isolate it from the whole of empirical  perception. Even less than space itself do we have the fundamental  concepts, axioms and postulates of geometry in our consciousness  before distilling them, by abstraction and idealization, from  experience. The second introduction is more polemical, the main  target of its attacks being Kant's apriorism. Ueberweg accepts Kant's  contention that geometry is an apodictic science. But he does not see  why this should imply that space is known a priori. In the first place,  Kant has failed to show how the a priori nature of space might ensure  the validity of the principles of geometry: Kant claims that this is so,  but he does not derive these principles from that nature. In the  second place, Kant has never proved that there cannot be an apodic­ tic science concerning an empirical object. He knows only the  dilemma empirical or a priori; but there is a third alternative, namely,  "rational elaboration of the empirically given, in accordance with  logical norms, without an a priori contents of knowledge".26 In fact,  apodictical certainty belongs to the system of geometry, not to its  several principles, regarded in isolation. The latter possess merely  assertoric, i.e. factual, certainty. Kant failed to see that the theorems  derived from the principles, though supported by them, can also serve  to strengthen them. This. however, is a common character of all  sciences built by deduction from hypothetical premises: "The  agreement of all consequences among themselves and with  experience confirms the presuppositions and bestows on them an </p><div id="pagenum"><p>increasing certainty, which becomes absolute as soon as one can </p></div><div id="pagenum"><p>262 CHAPTER 4 </p></div><p id="page">prove that the factually given can be explained only from these  premises. ,,27 This modern-sounding epistemological conception was  already held by Ueberweg when he wrote his first introduction,  though he stated it less neatly there. Even if a philosopher might  succeed in deriving geometry from the essence of space -he says -he  would not thereby discover the foundation of the general belief in its  validity. "This is, in the case of geometrical axioms, the same in fact  as in the case of physical hypotheses, namely, the uninterrupted  approximate confirmation of their consequences by experience. In­ numerable propositions derived from the geometrical axioms allow  comparison with experience through factual construction. Absolute  agreement is, of course, impossible, because we cannot construct  with absolute exactness; but we find that, within the reach of our  experience, the more exact our construction, the more exact is the  agreement. ,,28  But Ueberweg's main purpose is not to determine wherein lies the  certainty of the indemonstrable principles of geometry, but, as a  preliminary contribution thereto, to exhibit a connection between the  familiar axioms, postulates and fundament:tl concepts in Euclid, by  deriving them from a common source. This is found by (1) analysing  our global sensory awareness, in order to obtain general concepts and  propositions; (2) idealizing the latter by ascribing them absolute,  infinite precision. If we can show that the whole of geometry can be  built upon this basis just as well or even better than upon Euclid's  principles, we shall have paved the way "for the right opinion  concerning the logical character of the Euclidean axioms and for the  recognition of geometry as a natural science".29  Ueberweg observes that "space is separated from the whole of  sensory intuition only through the perception of movements". 30 The  main facts revealed thereby can be stated in many ways. Ueberweg  formulates them as follows:  According to the evidence of sense. a solid material body can:  (I) If unfixed, be carried anywhere. if no other solid body is previously located there.  (II) If fixed at one place (Stelle) only, it can no longer move everywhere, without  limitations, but it will not be deprived of all movement.  (III) If fixed at a second place, no part of it can be moved any longer in all the ways  that were possible in Case II, but it can still be moved.  (IV) But if we fix the body at a third place. which could still be moved in Case III, </p><div id="pagenum"><p>the movement of the body becomes altogether impossible.;! </p></div><div id="pagenum"><p>EMPIRICISM, APRIORISM, CONVENTIONALISM 263 </p></div><p id="page">These obvious, familiar empirical facts are now idealized. That is, we  assume that the stated properties are true with absolute precision.  U eberweg justifies this assumption, as we might expect, by the  empirical truth of its consequences, especially by the fact that the  propositions inferred from the idealized statements I-IV are mutually  consistent and agree with experience with increasing precision as we  carry out our constructions more exactly.32 Lie has shown that  axioms essentially equivalent to Ueberweg's are sufficient for charac­ tenzmg three-dimensional maximally symmetric spaces.33 But  Ueberweg thought he could characterize Euclidean space with them.  His derivations are therefore inevitably defective.  We shall only discuss his proof of the parallel postulate. U eberweg  defines a point as "the absolutely simple space element"; he charac­ terizes it also as that element of a body which is such that any  two -but not any three -of them can be fixed without altogether  impeding the movement of the body. A movement with a fixed point  P is called a rotation about P. The set of all points occupied by a  figure F during a movement m is the path (Weg) of F during m. A line  is the path of a moving point. A straight line is a line whose path  during rotation about two of its points coincides with itself. Given  two points P, Q, there is one and only one straight line through P and  Q.34 A straight line can also be defined as a line of constant direction.  In order to explain this, Ueberweg goes into a detailed discussion of  the concept of direction (Richtung). A moving figure changes its place  (Ort). Two places differ only in their position (Lage). If a point P is  carried to a point Q over a path absolutely determined by P and Q  "that determination of the transit of P to Q which depends on the  position of Q relatively to the other points which Q can take while  rotating about P [in other words, on the position of Q within the  sphere through Q centred at P] is called linear direction (Linien­ richtung)" .35 In the light of this definition, U eberweg concludes that a  straight line is a line of one direction. The difference between the  directions of two straight lines meeting at a point P is called  angle. Ueberweg defines circles and arcs and shows how to use the  latter to measure angles. Two straight lines m, n which make equal  corresponding angles with a third line t are said to have the same  direction. U eberweg defines parallels as straight lines that have the  same direction. Under this definition, two lines m, n which are </p><div id="pagenum"><p>parallel relatively to a transversal t (with which they make equal </p></div><div id="pagenum"><p>264 CHAPTER 4 </p></div><p id="page">m------------~~r_------- A L-_a: ______________ ----'~~ 8  Fig. 19.  corresponding angles), need not be parallel relatively to a second trans­ versal f'. The statement that parallelism, as defined by Ueberweg,  does not depend on the choice of the transversal is equivalent to  Euclid's fifth postulate. This statement is neither proved nor postu­ lated by Ueberweg. He proves instead that given two points P, Q and  a direction m at P, there is a unique direction n at Q which is equal to  m (in the sense that the straight lines in directions m and n make  equal corresponding angles with the straight line PQ).36 In Ueberweg's  terminology, this may be stated thus: Given a straight line m and a  point Q outside it, there is one and only one straight line n through Q  which is parallel to m (relatively to a fixed transversal). U eberweg  omits the proviso I have added in parenthesis, and concludes that any  straight line meeting a pair of parallel lines (in his sense) makes equal  corresponding angles with them.37 Euclid I, 32 (the three interior  angles of a triangle are equal to two right angles) follows easily from  the last proposition, but, contrary to U eberweg's belief, this theorem  is not a logical consequence of his premises. Let ABC be a triangle  with internal angles a, {3, 'Y and let m be a line through C which  makes an angle a with AC, as shown in Fig. 19. Let w denote the  angle corresponding to {3 which m makes with BC at C. It is plain that  a + w + 'Y = 1T'. According to Ueberweg's definition, m is the unique  parallel to AB thiOugh C, relatively to AC. But this does not imply  that m is also the unique parallel to AB through C relatively to BC.  We do not know, therefore, whether w = {3. Consequently, we cannot  conclude that a + {3 + 'Y = 1T'.  4.1.3 Benno Erdmann  The next significant contributions to geometrical empmClsm in the </p><div id="pagenum"><p>19th century were made by Riemann and Helmholtz. We have already </p></div><div id="pagenum"><p>EMPIRICISM, APRIORISM, CONVENTIONALISM 265 </p></div><p id="page">dealt with them in Parts 2.2 and 3.1. They were extensively discussed  and made known to the philosophical public in The Axioms of  Geometry, a book published in 1877 by Benno Erdmann (1851-1921).  The chief purpose of this work is to show that the new geometric  theory of space, which Erdmann ascribes to Riemann and Helmholtz,  confirms the empiricist theory of spatial intuition and refutes Kant's  philosophy of space and geometry. In order to show this, Erdmann  first presents the said theory as a successful attempt to provide a  definition of space. The definition arrived at, after a carefully  motivated exposition, is simply a restatement of Helmholtz's axioms  for Euclidean geometry.38 Erdmann's exposition is somewhat naive  and is marred by several mathematical misconceptions. Since the  book was very popular among philosophical readers, these features  have probably exerted a damaging influence on philosophical discus­ sions about space and geometry.  According to Erdmann, Riemann's lecture showed how to define  the concept of space by specification of the general concept of an  n-fold extended ~anifold. The procedure, he says, is analogous to  that used in analytical geometry for providing the concepts of in­ tuitively given spatial figures. It is merely a matter of finding analytic  determinations which correspond to every essential trait of our in­ tuitive representation of space. Thus, the intuitive feature usually  described by saying that space is three-dimensional "is characterized  by the fact that the position of every point is univocally determined  by its relations to three mutually independent spatial quantities, e.g.  to a "ystem of three orthogonal coordinate axes". This is expressed  analytically by the dependence of every point upon three independent  real variables (coordinates).39 The continuity of space is manifested  intuitively by its infinite divisibility.40 Analytically, this is expressed as  follows: as an object moves in space from a point A to a point B, the  coordinates of its position must take all real values between their  value at A and their value at B; if two coordinates change together,  while the third remains fixed, their quotient approaches a limit as their  variation tends to zero.41  Erdmann proposes the following general concept of space: Space is  a continuous quantity whose elements are univocally determined by  three mutually independent (real) variables.42 Erdmann classifies such  3-fold determined continuous quantities into two kinds: those which </p><div id="pagenum"><p>have and those which do not have interchangeable coordinates. </p></div><div id="pagenum"><p>266 CHAPTER 4 </p></div><p id="page">According to him, the former kind exactly corresponds to Riemann's  concept of a 3-fold extended manifold. Space, of course, belongs to  that kind. 43 Riemann's notion of curvature is all that Erdmann uses to  specify this concept.44 3-fold extended manifolds can have a constant  or a variable curvature. A constant curvature can be positive, nega­ tive or equal to zero. The choice between these alternatives must  depend, Erdmann says, "on the properties that we, in fact, observe in  our spatial intuition". Erdmann concludes without further ado that  these properties are the same as "the conditions which provide the  basis for the congruence relations of our geometry".45 He accepts  Helmholtz's analysis: the free mobility of rigid bodies implies that  space has a constant curvature. Which is the value of this curvature?  "The answer seems obvious, since the theorems of space geometry  show that all metric determinations of the plane can be transferred  without any material (inhaltiche) modification to our three-dimen- sional space. [ ... ] From this agreement, however, we cannot conclude  immediately [ ... ] that we may ascribe a constant zero curvature to  space, because geometrical measurements would give the same  results if that curvature possessed an infinitely small positive or  negative value. [ ... ] All we can do, therefore, is to determine by  means of very carefully performed measurements the sum of the  angles of empirically given triangles of the largest possible size." As  far as we can tell, the constant curvature of space is indeed zero.46  Space may be defined, therefore, as a threefold extended manifold  with constant zero curvature. Erdmann believes that this strictly  conceptual definition can be retranslated into the language of intuition  which was our starting point: to every analytic character thus singled  out there must correspond a unique intuitive meaning. He is ap­ parently unaware of the fact that one and the same abstract mathe­ matical structure can have many very different intuitive embodi­ ments. This fact however should have been obvious in the light of  contemporary projective geometry and was amply discussed in Felix  Klein's Erlangen Programme, a work with which Erdmann apparently  was acquainted.  Mathematical misconceptions are not uncommon among soi disant  scientific philosophers. In this, as in other things, Erdmann is their  forerunner. Let us briefly mention a few of his confusions. (i) Metric  relations on a continuous manifold (in Riemann's sense) concern the </p><div id="pagenum"><p>way how each panicular point is determined by the coordinates </p></div><div id="pagenum"><p>EMPIRICISM, APRIORISM, CONVENTION ALISM 267 </p></div><p id="page">(Erdmann, AG, p.49), Erdmann apparently believes that Riemann's  charts, like the classical Cartesian mapping, are isometric mappings of  space onto R 3, or that they induce a metric on space. (ii) Geodetic  lines on a cylindrical surface "exhibit exactly the same curvature  (genau dieselben Kriimmungsverhiiltnisse) as the straight line on the  plane" (Erdmann, AG, p.52). Since some of these geodetic lines are  circles, while others are spirals, it follows that the new geometry, as  expounded by its philosophical spokesman, conflicts with common  sense. (iii) "The straightest line in a spherical space is that which  possesses the same constant curvature at every point." (Erdmann,  AG, p.lS5). If this were correct, every circular arc would be a  straightest line in a spherical space. This would apply to a very good  approximation to semicircles drawn on the earth's surface, anyone of  which would then not be longer than its diameter! (iv) Actual  measurements show that the curvature of space certainly falls within  a very small interval about zero. Consequently the probability that it  is exactly zero is very high, so high indeed that we may conclude that  it is zero (Erdmann, AG, p.70). Using this method of statistical  inference we should be able to assign a fixed real value to any  physical parameter which can be measured with a passably narrow  margin of error.  Erdmann's discussion of the philosophy of geometry is set in the  context of a rather primitive ontological framework. Erdmann  assumes it quite uncritically but he, at least, has the courage to make  it explicit.  All our intuitions of external things and relations are the product of an interaction,  whose conditions depend partly on the [ ... J constitution of things, partly on the  essence of psychical events. We are in total ignorance of the manner in which this  interaction takes place, but we can derive the following conclusions from the fact of its  existence. In the first place, the constitution of every element of our intuition must  depend in part on the nature of the stimulating processes, in part on the way how these  stimuli are received and elaborated by the psychical activities. Consequently [ ... J the  entire material of our sensations is merely a system of signs for things, since the  properties which we ascribe to the latter are nothing but the results of an interaction,  one of whose terms. namely, the constitution of our mental activities, we simply take  for granted. [ ... J Also the forms in which that material of sensations is ordered -the  spatial forms not more and not otherwise than the intellec.tual- can only be a system of  signs for the relations and situations of things."  The main conflicting theses of the theory of knowledge can now be </p><div id="pagenum"><p>easily described: Empiricism maintains that our representations </p></div><div id="pagenum"><p>268 CHAPTER 4 </p></div><p id="page">wholly depend on things, while rationalism holds that they are wholly  independent from them. Both persuasions have three varieties.  Sensualist empiricism believes that our representations agree with  things absolutely. Formalist empiricism claims only a partial  agreement, covering "the quantitative relations of space, time and  lawfulness (Gesetzlichkeit)", while representations differ from things  in all their qualitative aspects. There is finally a brand of empiricism  which Erdmann proposes to call apriorism (Apriorismus); this seeks  to show that all our representations are completely different from the  constitution and the relations of things, but correspond to them in  every part. The rationalist can also maintain that representations,  though uncaused by things, entirely agree with them (preestablished  harmony); or that they agree only partially, so that, say, the forms of  thought are identical with the forms of being (formal rationalism); or,  finally, that every element in our representations is not only entirely  independent of things, but specifically different from them (nativism).  Geometric knowledge concerns the properties, specifically the  metric properties of our representation of space. The philosophy of  geometry may take any of the above forms, as applied to this  particular representation. According to Erdmann, "the mathematical  results force us to conclude that our representation of space must be  unambiguously conditioned by the actually experienced effects of  things upon our consciousness".48 In other words, a rationalist  philosophy of geometry is incompatible with the results of geometric  research. Three arguments back this conclusion:  (i) The logical possibility of n-dimensional manifolds (n > 3) shows  that "the influence of experience, i.e. of the things affecting us from  outside" does not merely awaken but actually determines our parti­ cular representation of space as a three-dimensional manifold.49 (This  argument is valueless: in Kant's philosophy, the a priori nature of our  intuition of space is certainly compatible with the logical viability of  other spaces with a different structure.)  (ii) The foundations of geometry involve the empirical concepts of  rigid body and movement.50 (The existence of freely movable rigid  bodies is the fact which, according to Helmholtz, lies at the foun­ dation of geometry. But perfectly rigid bodies do not actually exist.  To say that the concept of such a body is obtained from experience is  therefore somewhat far-fetched.) </p><div id="pagenum"><p>(iii) If the representation of space were generated independently of </p></div><div id="pagenum"><p>EMPIRICISM, APRIORISM, CONVENTION ALISM 269 </p></div><p id="page">experience "by the spontaneous force of the soul", if it were only  "the universal intuitive form of receptivity towards external things, in  Kant's sense", it would not be possible for us to form intuitive  representations of other three-dimensional manifolds with different  metrical properties. But Helmholtz has shown that this is possible.51  (In the end, this is the mainstay of Erdmann's empiricism. The reader  will judge whether it is imposed by mathematical results. Since we are  apparently unable to imagine a space of more than three dimensions,  one might feel inclined to conclude, by inversion of the foregoing  argument, that three-dimensionality is not an empirical feature of  space. But Erdmann knows for certain -presumably by a special  revelation -that "the particular constitution of things outside us  compels us to develop exactly three dimensions, neither more nor  less".52)  Geometry excludes rationalism but it will not assist our choice  between the three varieties of empiricism. Sensualism, however, is  utterly discredited by modern research on the psychophysiology of  perception. Most scientists favour empiricist formalism: the qualita­ tive contents of our sensory perceptions may be quite foreign to the  actual nature of external things, but their relational structure, especi­ ally insofar as it can be quantitatively conceived, reflects the structure  of things themselves. Both Riemann and Helmholtz hold this position  in their philosophies of space and geometry.53 Erdmann, on the other  hand, inclines to the third alternative, which he calls by the un­ orthodox name of empiricist apriorism. He apparently believes that  the very rejection of sensualism inevitably leads to it, at least in the  philosophY of geometry (so that empiricist formalism in this field  would be intrinsically untenable). Erdmann reasons thus:  Physiological research concludes no less surely than psychological analysis that no  process in the central organ is conceivable which might bridge the gap between the ob­ servable extensive stimuli and the intensive formation of representations. This makes  it understandable that the explanation of the psychological origin of the represen­ tation of space is entirely independent of the assumption of a spatially extended world  of things; even though it is, of course, undeniable that some inducements (Anliisse)  which prompt our psychical activities to develop the representation of space must be  present in the relations of things themselves. That these inducements cannot them­ selves consist in spatial relations follows from the fact that we group sensations  spatially. The very thought that one and the same form of space should mediate  (vermitteln) the relations of things while, on the other hand, it also effects (bewerk­</p><div id="pagenum"><p>stelligen) an order among sensations which are altogether different from those things, </p></div><div id="pagenum"><p>270 CHAPTER 4 </p></div><p id="page">seems contradictory. The contradiction looks even sharper when we consider that this  form. as the form of intuition of our sensations. must be, like these, the product of an  interaction, so that it cannot exist apart from this interaction. as the form of a part of  the interacting elements. The whole Question depends therefore on the subjectivity of  sensations. If this is granted -and there can no longer be any doubt about this  point -the subjectivity of the binding forms, especially of our representation of space,  will follow.l4  Erdmann's reasoning is of course inconclusive. A relational structure  such as that defined by a geometry is just the sort of thing that can  subsist equally well in wholly disparate embodiments. The same  abstract ordering introduced among sensations by some cause can be  introduced by a different cause among other very different entities. In  the light of modern axiomatics all this is obvious. But it should have  been clear also in 1877 to anyone familiar with the Erlangen Pro­ gramme or with projective geometry.55  Erdmann, like Mill and Ueberweg before him, must face the fact  that the better known geometrical objects, such as circles and right  angles, are not exactly like anything actually perceived. He makes  things even more difficult for himself by assuming that we cannot  have an intuitive representation of surfaces -not to mention lines or  points -but only of very thin bodies. 56 This is of course quite wrong:  if we can have a definite representation of a body we must have a  representation of its limits, and these are surfaces. But the fact  remains that actually perceived surfaces and bodies show ir­ regularities which are ignored by elementary geometry. Erdmann  makes one very important remark which imperils the whole system of  geometrical empiricism: we cannot recognize those irregularities as  such unless we have a concept of the rule from which they diverge. 57  We can construct in thought (in Gedanken), with perfect assurance, lines which are  exactly straight and circles whose peripheries have an entirely uniform curvature,  though we would never be able to have an intuitive representation of them as extended  in only one dimension. The metrical properties of the geometric concepts of con­ struction are therefore neither factual properties of bodies nor concepts directly  abstracted from them, but empirical ideas [Ideen, i.e. regulative ideas in Kant's sense];  they modify the observable properties of the elementary shapes of bodies in such way  that they become ideal models (idea Ie Musterbilder) which can be indefinitely ap­ proached but are never attained by reality.'"  Erdmann declares that "the ideality of the concepts of construction </p><div id="pagenum"><p>does not exclude their empirical origin".59 His proof of this statement </p></div><div id="pagenum"><p>EMPIRICISM, APRIORISM, CONVENTION ALISM 271 </p></div><p id="page">is surprisingly weak. It runs as follows: "empirical ideas" analogous  to these -i.e. such that no empirical entity will ever exactly satisfy  their requirements -are also found in mechanics and, generally  speaking, in all mathematical physics; now, one can hardly doubt that  the latter is an empirical science. Indeed one can hardly doubt it, until  one's attention is drawn to this remarkable fact. The ideality of the  fundamental concepts of modern physics was indeed one of the chief  motivations of 17th-century rationalism. The abandonment of this  philosophical position will not suffice to justify the invocation of that  very fact as an argument for empiricism. If geometry shares this  property with every branch of applied mathematics, this implies only  that we face an epistemological problem concerning the latter dis­ cipline as a whole: how can it be so helpful in the investigation of  nature if it deals with entities which are never actually realized in  nature? Erdmann does not entirely bypass this problem, but his  attempted solution is very unsatisfactory. It applies specifically to  geometry and it is based on the alleged homogeneity of the elements  of our spatial intuition, i.e. of "the smallest particular parts of space  and the line and surface elements derived from them".60 This "factual  homogeneity of the geometrical elements [ ... J makes it possible to  conceive the construction concepts of geometry as ideals, since all  factual divergences from them need not be thought of as essential  differences, but as divergences from the pure concept, which in each  particular case can be strictly taken into account both in our intuition  and in our calculations. The ideality of the geometric concepts of  construction is therefore quite compatible with their empirical origin,  since it does not depend on the peculiarity of their source but on the  homogeneity of the spatial elements".61 I do not find that this ap­ proach makes the empiricist position any stronger. After all, even if  we do possess such an "intuition" of space as a set of homogeneous  elements or as a union of homogeneous parts, we can hardly claim  that it reproduces the contents of any actual sense perceptions, such  as we would expect to lie at the root of any empirically generated  representation.  Erdmann's final remarks further undermine geometrical empiricism.  Geometry is not an empirical discipline in the same sense as the  sciences that deal with quality. Even in its remotest and most  complicated parts, it needs no other materials than the definitions and </p><div id="pagenum"><p>the axioms, on the one hand, and "the pure, i.e. indeterminately filled </p></div><div id="pagenum"><p>272 CHAPTER 4 </p></div><p id="page">representation of space", on the other. It can attain all its results by  purely deductive methods, thus bestowing on everyone of its  theorems the same generality, necessity and immutability which it  claims for its principles. Geometry does not consist however in a  mere analysis of the intension of its basic concepts. It is a synthetic  science. "The synthetic character of geometrical propositions lies in  the fact that in each of them the axioms are applied to new compli­ cations of the concepts of construction. ,,62 The development of  geometry is independent of every particular experience. This has  been usually understood as an argument for rationalism. But, says  Erdmann,  it only follows frem it that the intuition, upon which the synthetic progress of geometry  depends, is not conditioned by the variegated, heterogeneous material of the qualita­ tively determined sense perceptions, but by the manifold of our representation of  space, which lies equally at the basis of every particular experience. Geometry is  independent of experience in all its developments because it presupposes that the  representation of space, whose relations of construction are studied by it, is equally  valid for every experience:3  This passage is Kantian in style and contents, in its assertions and in  its choice of words. But Erdmann ends on a Riemannian note. The  independence of geometry from experience is not absolute, but only  relative.  An exact investigation of limit cases of our metrical relations might reveal a divergence  from the constancy or from the null-value of the curvature. As soon as this divergence  is established, this corrected representation of space will become the subject-matter of  geometrical research, until we are eventually driven by further progress, in case this  new result turns out to be unsatisfactory, to make a revision of the properties of  congruence and flatness.64  4.1.4 Auguste Calinon  N on-Euclidean geometries and their epistemological implications  were briskly debated in France in the 1890's. In this section, we shall  refer to one of the participants in that debate, Auguste Calinon (born  1850). It is only with some reservations that I class him as an  empiricist. He resolutely ascribes the source of geometrical concepts  to our idealizing faculty, which follows the suggestions of sense  perception, but is not enslaved to it. He believes that we learn  through experience whatever we can know about the actual geometry </p><div id="pagenum"><p>of the universe, but he radically questions the possibility of </p></div><div id="pagenum"><p>EMPIRICISM, APRIORISM, CONVENTIONALISM 273 </p></div><p id="page">ascertaining it, except locally and approximately. Calinon anticipates, at  any rate, many views typical of 20th-century geometric empiricism and  on the matter of physical geometry he shows an open-mindedness  comparable to Riemann's.  Calinon published his philosophical views in two short papers on  "The geometric spaces" (1889, 1891) and in an article about "The  geometric indeterminacy of the universe" (1893). Like most 20th­ century empiricists, he makes a neat distinction between mathematics  and physics, "two sciences [ ... 1 absolutely different in their object  and their method, and also in the type and degree of certainty  appropriate to each".65 Geometry is a branch of mathematics, and it  would preserve "its full logical value if the physical world did not  exist or if it were other than it is".66 Geometry is the deductive theory  of forms (lines, surfaces). A geometric theory begins with the exact  definition of one or more such forms. The theory is valid (legitime) if  no contradiction follows from these definitions. Geometry thus  conceived does not rest upon an experimental basis.67 Geometry, on  the other hand, should not be confused with mathematical analysis.  The properties of every geometrical figure may be expressed analy­ tically by means of equations. But not every equation can be made to  correspond to a conceivable figure or form. We can only conceive  clearly such forms as are very similar to those we see about us. All  such forms have three dimensions at most. Thus, geometry is the  branch of mathematics which takes as its starting-point the notion of  the forms conceivable to us, that is, the forms of one, two or three  dimensions, that are very similar to the forms surrounding us.68 Does  this mean that the fundamental concepts of geometry have their  source in experience? Not at all. "Our knowledge of real forms is  experimental; hence it is incomplete and only approximate. But the  ideal forms of geometry are given by exact definitions, which enable  us to know those forms absolutely and completely. ,,69  The first form defined by Euclidean geometry is the straight line.  According to Calinon, its definition includes two properties: (a) for  any two points P, Q, there is one and only one straight line through P  and Q; (b) given a straight line m and a point P outside m, there is one  and only one straight line through P on the same plane as m, which  does not meet m. Thanks to Lobachevsky and others we know that  property (b) does not follow from (a). Let us call the form defined by </p><div id="pagenum"><p>(a) and (b) the Euclidean straight. It is clearly a special case of a more </p></div><div id="pagenum"><p>274 CHAPTER 4 </p></div><p id="page">general concept, defined by property (a) alone. Let us call this the  general straight. The theory of this form has been called non-Eucli­ dean geometry. Calinon prefers to call it general geometry, because  "far from being the negation of Euclidean geometry, it includes the  latter as a special case".70 The analytic development of general  geometry supplies formulae which contain an undetermined  parameter. The familiar formulae of Euclidean geometry are obtained  by assigning a definite value to this parameter. Calinon points to a  seeming paradox. The general straight through two given points P, Q  depends on the undetermined parameter, so that we shall have  infinitely many straights through P and Q, one for each value of the  parameter. This contradicts however the definition of the general  straight. 7! Calinon overcomes this difficulty by treating each value of  the parameter as the characteristic of a different three-dimensional  space. On each space there is just one straight between two given  points P and Q. This leads Calinon to an even broader conception of  general geometry: "General geometry is the study of all spaces  compatible with geometrical reasoning", i.e. of all consistent systems  of one-, two- and three-dimensional forms. The spaces studied by  Euclid and the classical non-Euclidean geometries are only a proper  subset of such systems, which may be called identical spaces  (espaces identiques), for "every figure constructed at a given point of  such a space can be reproduced identically at any other point of the  same space".72 Euclidean space is not only identical but also homo­ geneous, in the following sense: in it alone, shape is independent of  size; two figures can be similar even if they are not equal.  General geometry is independent of experience. We ask now:  which is the particular geometry that is realized in the material world?  The several geometric spaces studied by general geometry cannot  exist simultaneously, since they cannot contain the same forms. "In  order to know which of these spaces contains the bodies we see about  us, we must necessarily resort to experience. ,,73 Ordinary facts  suggest that space is Euclidean. We constantly see bodies which  preserve the same shape as they move from one place to another.  Moreover, men have always imitated on a larger or a smaller scale the  shape of the things surrounding them. These facts are indeed so  familiar that we tend to believe that they are inevitable, being some­ how rooted in the essence of the world or in the nature of the human </p><div id="pagenum"><p>mind. But we must not forget that observed data are never quite </p></div><div id="pagenum"><p>EMPIRICISM. APRIORISM. CONVENTIONALISM 275 </p></div><p id="page">exact. Even if experience shows that the space we live in is identical  and homogeneous this means only that it is very nearly Euclidean. All  that we may conclude from this is that "the differences that might  exist between Euclidean geometry and the actual geometry of the  world (celie qui realise l' U nivers) are smaller than the errors of  observation".74 This conclusion is compatible with any of the follow­ ing three hypotheses:  (i) Our space is, and will remain, strictly Euclidean.  (ii) Our space differs slightly from the Euclidean space, but is  always the same.  (iii) Our space realizes in the course of time several different  geometric spaces; in other words, the spatial parameter varies with  time, either by deviating more or less from the Euclidean parameter,  or by oscillating about a given parameter not too different from the  Euclidean one.  Calinon apparently believed at first that it made sense to ascribe a  definite geometry to the universe, even if such geometry changes with  time. Nevertheless, he held that we are in no position to know it even  approximately. Thus, if the limited region of space in which all our  measurements are performed happens to be very small in comparison  with the whole of space, the whole may possess any geometric  structure whatsoever, even though our experiments show that limited  region to be approximately Euclidean. Calinon adds: "This hypothesis  that our measurable universe is contained in an infinitely small part of  an arbitrary (but otherwise well determined) space, is the most general  hypothesis we can make within the limits prescribed by observed  facts".75 In his paper of 1893 he takes a more radical stance. "The  space in which we locate the geometric facts of the universe is  indeterminate; this is a fundamental fact.,,76 This geometric indeter­ minacy of the universe results from the fact that our measurements  are only approximate and have a local scope. Calinon draws several  consequences from this fact. Thus, though he is apparently unaware  of Klein's work on Clifford surfaces, he says that many, very  different spaces can be locally isometric to Euclidean space, just as  the surface of a cylinder or a cone is locally isometric to a Euclidean  plane. Even if our observations could show that the space surround­ ing us is exactly Euclidean, that would not teach us much about the  global geometry of the world. Calinon's conception of geometric </p><div id="pagenum"><p>indeterminacy does not imply -like Griinbaum's -that space, by its </p></div><div id="pagenum"><p>276 CHAPTER 4 </p></div><p id="page">own nature, cannot possess a definite geometric structure. The in­ determinacy is purely epistemological, not ontological. But Calinon,  in 1893, does not appear to have had much use for the real, though  unknowable, structure of space.  When Calinon wrote his paper, he had read Poincare's famous  article on non-Euclidean geometries,77 in which the choice of a  physical geometry was compared to the choice of a coordinate system  (both were said to be a matter of convenience, not of truth). Calinon  apes Poincare's language. But he emphasizes that the different  geometries are not simply equivalent. What is more important, he  expressly rejects Poincare's contention that we are bound to prefer  Euclidean geometry because it is by far the simplest and most  convenient. The great advantage of geometric indeterminacy is that it  permits us to approach each problem with the geometric represen­ tation which is most likely to provide the simplest solution.78 Thus,  Newton's law of gravitation is verified only within certain limits. At  the distance which separates two neighbouring molecules of the same  body, the law seems to be different. A difference as yet unknown  might also become apparent at astronomical distances. "We may  therefore very well conceive that at such large distances the law of  attraction [ ... ) could find its simplest expression in another geometric  representation of the universe, different from the Euclidean  representation. ,,79  Calinon's conception of general geometry is taken up by Georges  Lechalas (1851-1919) in his Etude sur l'espace et Ie temps (1896),  where several points of it receive further clarification. The traditional  postulates of geometry, says Lechalas, are hidden definitions  (definitions meconnues). If we continue to ignore their real nature, we  shall insist in demonstrating them. But they cannot be proved from  the definitions which are usually taken as a starting-point of  geometry. These are too general, so that many different surfaces or  lines fulfil the familiar definitions of the plane or the straight line.  "N ow, if this is so, it is plain that one can only overcome this  indeterminacy by adding, under the guise of postulates, the charac­ teristic supplementary properties required to specify the line or the  surface one has in mind." (Lechalas, ET, p.12). Though Lechalas  maintains with Calinon that geometry must somehow attach images  to its concepts, he is on the verge of dismissing this restriction as </p><div id="pagenum"><p>untenable. Euclideans, he says, will object that non-Euclidean </p></div><div id="pagenum"><p>EMPIRICISM, APRIORISM, CONVENTION ALISM 277 </p></div><p id="page">geometries are not genuine geometries, because we are unable to  form adequate images of figures incompatible with Euclidean space.  But in truth we are just as incapable of forming adequate images of  Euclidean figures. "All our images are imperfect [ ... J and geometrical  reasoning concerns the ideas (idees) with which the images are  associated, and not the images themselves. Thus it matters little if the  disagreement is large or small. If it is so large that we can no longer  follow on the image the conclusions drawn by analysis, we can still  conceive that other beings, with a different sensibility, could have  images agreeing with those conclusions as nearly as our own images  agree with Euclidean geometry." (Lechalas, ET, p.43; see also  Lechalas, IGG, pp.16f.) This fantasy of other, differently organized,  sensitive beings is not really needed to back general geometry, as it is  conceived by Lechalas. This is clear, I think, in the light of his  explanation of Calinon's concept of a plurality of spaces, each of  which admits some forms, while excluding others. "For us, a space is  nothing but the verbal substantialization (fa substantialisation  verbale) of mutually compatible spatial relations. To say that a figure  cannot enter into a space is tantamount to saying that it constitutes a  system of relations which is incompatible with a more general system,  embellished with the name of space (decore du nom d'espace)."  (Lechalas, ET, p.52 n.2). From this point of view, the mainstay of  geometry is no longer intuition or imagination, but the set of concep­ tual relations determined by the definitions.  Like Calinon, Lechalas rejects the empirical origin of geometrical  notions. "Since we do not regard geometry as an innate science in the  proper and strict sense of this word, it is clear that we must look for a  starting-point or rather a mental stimulus (un excitant pour l' esprit)  among perceptions or experiences. The mind, working with sense­ data which lack all precision, applies to them general notions which  were perhaps aroused in it on the occasion of those data. Thus it is  able to build an a priori science, which might even be in fact  inapplicable to actual phenomena without thereby losing any of its  value."(Lechalas, ET, p.23). This intellectual exercise generates an  infinity of geometries which are equally rational (egalement  rationelles). Reason cannot prefer one of them to the others. But  experience can reveal which of them is fulfilled in our universe.  (Lechalas, ET, p.64). Since this particular system of geometry is in </p><div id="pagenum"><p>no way necessary we can only get to know it by observation. "Only </p></div><div id="pagenum"><p>278 CHAPTER 4 </p></div><p id="page">through measurements shall we be able to determine the parameter of  our universe, assuming that our space is identical [in Calinon's sense,  i.e. that it is a maximally symmetric space], an assumption which is  not prescribed a priori. Consequently that determination can be  carried out, like every experimental determination, only up to a  certain degree of approximation." (Lechalas, ET, p.88). Though  Lechalas does not expect us to learn by experimental research which  is the exact geometrical structure of the world, he believes that it  possesses one and that we can determine it with ever increasing  precision. He criticizes Calinon's thesis on the geometrical indeter­ minacy of the universe. He argues somewhat unconvincingly that we  can determine to a very good degree of approximation that light-rays  travel along Euclidean straight lines, at least within the solar system  and even as far as the nearest stars (the stars that have an observable  parallax). He admits next that no experiment can show whether we  live in a Euclidean space or in another three-dimensional space which  is isometric to Euclidean space (Lechalas, ET, p. 92). But, he adds,  two isometric 3-spaces differ only in the way they lie in a four­ dimensional space, just as two isometric 2-spaces or surfaces, such as  the plane and the cylinder, differ only in the way they lie in 3-space.  From the human point of view, it does not make much sense to speak  of geometric indeterminacy merely because we cannot distinguish  between several three-dimensional structures which are intrinsically  indiscernible. (Lechalas, ET, p.98f.). I am afraid that Lechalas is  wrong on this point. Apparently, he had not yet heard about the  Clifford-Klein space problem (Section 2.3.10). And he pays no atten­ tion to the global topological properties of the several spaces, which,  generally speaking, are no less intrinsic than their local isometry. By  taking them into account, even a Flatlander should be able to dis­ tinguish between a cylinder and a plane, though he may have some  trouble in actually telling one from the other if the cylinder is very  large or if he stubbornly contests the identity of indiscernibles.  4.1.5 Ernst Mach  Ernst Mach (1838-1916) explains his thoughts on geometry in the last  chapters of his book Knowledge and Error (1905).80 His analyses,  which attain a level of concreteness never found in Erdmann or Mill,  contribute new viewpoints and insights to geometrical empIriCism. </p><div id="pagenum"><p>Mach believes, like John Locke, that the empiricist philosopher </p></div><div id="pagenum"><p>EMPIRICISM, APRIORISM, CONVENTIONALISM 279 </p></div><p id="page">shows his mettle by exhibiting the actual development of our ideas  from experience, The psychological origin and evolution of geometry  had been the subject of some valuable studies by Henri Poincare.81  Mach undertakes a more systematic treatment of this matter.  Geometry has three sources: intuition, experience and reasoning.  "Our notions of space are rooted in our physiological constitution.  Geometric concepts are the product of the idealization of physical  experiences of space. Systems of geometry, finally, originate in the  logical classification of the conceptual materials so gathered. ,,82  Spatial intuition is composed of "space sensations" (Raum­ empfindungen), which is Mach's name for the spatial ingredient  present in ordinary sensations. A spotlight seen in complete darkness  moves upward or downward, forward or backward, to the left or to  the right. These characters of the movement are immediately given  and do not depend upon a previous intellectual organization of the  perceptual field83 -as a matter of fact, the intellectual or scientific idea  of space, the space of geometry, is isotropic (equal in every direction)  and does not possess those characters. If someone applies a pin at  a point on my naked back and then pricks other points on my  back with another pin, I feel a second prick nearer or farther  from the first, above or below it, to its left or to its right.  There is also a neat spatial difference between the feeling  of being pricked with a pin and that of having, say, the back of a  spoon rubbed against one's back. In every impression received by  our senses we can distinguish, according to Mach, a "sense-im­ pression" (Sinnesempfindung), which depends on the quality of the  stimulus, and an "organ-impression" (Organempfindung), which  varies with the place of the skin, the eye, the tongue, etc., upon which  the stimulus acts. Organ-impressions are regarded by Mach as iden­ tical with space sensations. Intuitive or "physiological" space  is "a system of graduated organ-impressions (abgestufte Organ­ empfindungen), which certainly would not exist without sense­ impressions, but which, when it is aroused by the changing sense­ impressions, forms a permanent register, wherein those variable  sense-impressions are ordered".84 Physiological space is quite  different from the infinite, isotropic, metric space of classical  geometry and physics.85 First and foremost, it is not a metric space.  We can describe some regions of it as contained in others, and we can </p><div id="pagenum"><p>set up neighbourhood relations between its points, but any assignment </p></div><div id="pagenum"><p>280 CHAPTER 4 </p></div><p id="page">of real-valued distances to point-pairs in physiological space is arbi­ trary, unstable and, in the end, pointless. Physiological space can, at  most, be structured as a topological space. When viewed in this way,  it naturally falls into several components: visual or optic space, tactile  or haptic space, auditive space, etc. Mach makes some remarks about  the first two. Optic space is anisotropic, finite, limited. 86 It is certainly  not metric. "The places, distances, etc., of visual space are qualita­ tively, not quantitatively different. What we call visual size (Augen­ mass) is developed only on the basis of primitive physico-metrical  experiences.,,87 Mach regards the optic space as three-dimensionaL 88  However, since the direct perception of visual depth depends, to a  considerable extent, on the coordinated movements of the two eyes,  we might wish to maintain that three-dimensional vision is not ori­ ginally given in intuition, but developed through behaviour. From this  point of view, the third dimension of optic space should be classed,  like visual size, as a product of experience. On the other hand, the  different ocular movements required to bring a near or a distant  object into focus are hardly ever perceived as movements, let alone as  deliberate acts. The 'experiences' that lie at the source of our percep­ tion of visual depth must therefore be distinguished from those which  give rise to the idea of physico-geometrical space, such as the  experience that it takes me twenty steps to get to the front-door and  two hundred to go to the nearest bakery. Haptic space or "the space  of our skin corresponds to a two-dimensional, finite, unlimited  (closed) Riemannian space".89 This is nonsense, for R-spaces are  metric while haptic space is not. I take it that Mach means to say that  the latter can be naturally regarded as a two-dimensional compact  connected topological space. Mach does not emphasize the dis­ connectedness of haptic from optic space, nor the role of physico­ geometric space in the integration of data supplied by the different  senses. It is obvious, however, that the region in optic space where I  see the tip of my fingers and the region in haptic space where I feel  the pressure of my pen are mutually related only through their  association (or identification) with one and the same region of my  room, located at so many feet from the walls and the floor.  Mach claims that if man were a strictly sedentary animal, like an  oyster, he would never attain the representation of Euclidean space.  But the possibility of freely moving and reorienting the body as a </p><div id="pagenum"><p>whole makes us understand "that we can perform the same </p></div><div id="pagenum"><p>EMPIRICISM, APRIORISM, CONVENTIONALISM 281 </p></div><p id="page">movements everywhere and in every direction, that space has every­ where and in every direction the same constitution (gleich beschaffen  ist) and that it can be represented as unlimited and infinite".90  Experiences with bodies and their movements lie at the root of  geometry and inspire its fundamental postulate: the perfect homo­ geneity of space.  Let a body K move away from an observer A by being suddenly transported from the  environment FGH to the environment MNO. To the optical observer A the body K  decreases in size and assumes generally a different form. But to an optical observer B  who moves along with K and retains the same position with respect to K, K remains  unaltered. An analogous sensation is experienced by the tactual observer, although the  perspective diminution is here wanting for the reason that the sense of touch is not a  telepathic sense. The experiences of A and B must now be harmonised and their  contradictions eliminated, - a requirement which becomes especially imperative when  the same observer plays alternately the part of A and of B. And the only method by  which they can be harmonised is to attribute to K certain constant spatial properties  independently of its position with respect to other bodies. The space-sensations  determined by K in the observer A are recognised as dependent on other space­ sensations (the position of K with respect to the body of the observer A). But these  same space-sensations determined by K in A are independent of other space-sensa­ tions. characterising the position of K with respect to B. or with respect to  FGH ... MNO. In this independence lies the constancy with which we are here  concerned. The fundamental assumption of geometry thus reposes on an experience,  although of the idealised kind.91  The role played by bodies and by the handling of bodies in the  constitution of geometry is repeatedly emphasized by Mach, follow­ ing the tradition initiated by Ueberweg and Helmholtz. "Geometrical  concepts are obtained through the mutual comparison of physical  bodies.,,92 "The visual image must be enriched by physical experience  concerning corporeal objects to be geometrically available. ,,93 This  viewpoint leads to a curious distortion of historical fact: solid  geometry is said to have preceded plane geometry. We know however  that this is not so, that the beginnings of stereometry were slow and  difficult and came after plane geometry was a well-developed science.  Mach's bias is so strong that he even claims that "every geometrical  measurement is at bottom reducible to measurements of  volumes, to the enumeration of bodies. Measurements of lengths, like  measurements of areas, repose on the comparison of the volumes of  very thin strings, sticks and leaves of constant thickness. ,,94 The last  remark is preposterous. We can compare the flat polished surfaces of </p><div id="pagenum"><p>two stone slabs without paying any attention to the thickness of the </p></div><div id="pagenum"><p>282 CHAPTER 4 </p></div><p id="page">Fig. 20.  slabs; we can mark two points on each surface and compare their  distances by superposition, without having to employ a "very thin  string" as an instrument of comparison. Mach observes that pro­ positions equivalent to Euclid's fifth postulate can be proved ap­ proximately by means of easy experiments. Thus, with a set of  congruent triangular floor-tiles we can construct the figure shown in  Fig. 20 which is possible only if equidistant lines are straight. With a  triangular piece of paper, folded as in Fig. 21, we can prove that  the three internal angles of a triangle are equal to two right angles  (when the paper is folded along EF, FG, GH, the vertices A, B, C  meet at X and the angles at A, B, C appear as the parts of a single  straight angle). The first of these two experiences was probably  familiar to men of the earliest civilizations. On the intuitive origin of  the idea of straightness Mach repeats a trite remark: "A stretched  thread furnishes the distinguishing visualization of the straight line.  The straight line is characterized by its physiological simplicity. All its  parts induce the same sensation of direction; every point evokes the  mean of the space-sensations of the neighbouring points; every part,  however small, is similar to every other part, however great" .95 This  characterization however is but of little use to geometers. It is a  c  H B </p><div id="pagenum"><p>Fig. 21. </p></div><div id="pagenum"><p>EMPIRICISM, APRIORISM, CONVENTIONALISM 283 </p></div><p id="page">mistake to believe that the straight line is known to be the shortest  line through mere intuition, "The mere passive contemplation of  space would never lead to such a result, Measurement is experience  involving a physical reaction, a superposition-experiment.,,96 That a  straight line is determined by two of its points is also an experimental  notion, which Mach motivates as follows:  If a wire of any arbitrary shape be laid on a board in contact with two upright nails, and  slid along so as to be always in contact with the nails, the form and position of the parts  of the wire between the nails will be constantly changing. The straighter the wire is, the  slighter the alternation will be. A straight wire submitted to the same operation slides in  itself. Rotated round two of its own fixed points, a crooked wire will keep constantly  changing its position, but a straight wire will maintain its position, it will rotate within  itself. When we define, now, a straight line as the line which is completely determined  by two of its points, there is nothing in this concept except the idealization of the  empirical notion derived from the physical experience mentioned, - a notion by no  means directly furnished by the physiological act of visualization.97  Optical experiences with light-rays have probably aided the rapid  development of geometry, but we should not regard them as the  essential foundation of this science. "Rays of light in dust or smoke­ laden air furnish admirable visualizations of straight lines. But we can  derive the metrical properties of straight lines from rays of light just  as little as we can derive them from imaged straight lines.,,98 Mach is  the first author I know of, who took notice of how planes are actually  built in practice and pointed it out to his readers. "Physically a plane  is constructed by rubbing three bodies together until three surfaces,  A, B, C, are obtained, each of which exactly fits the others - a result  which can be accomplished [ ... ] with neither convex nor concave  surfaces, but with plane surfaces only.,,99 This practical procedure  which unambiguously defines one of the basic figures of geometry will  play an important role in Dingler's pragmatic foundation of this  science. In fact, if you construct two adjacent planes by this method,  their common edge will provide a better approximation to the straight  line than any taut string or light-ray.  The rational ingredient of geometry consists, according to Mach, in  the deductive organization of the concepts and insights supplied by  experience. He is well aware that geometrical concepts are not just  abstracted from experience but are formed by idealization. But his  treatment of this subject is not more satisfactory than what we have </p><div id="pagenum"><p>met in other empiricists. Mach stresses the need for idealization in the </p></div><div id="pagenum"><p>284 CHAPTER 4 </p></div><p id="page">constrlJction of geometry, but he does not see that it may require a  peculiar, independent, non-sensory principle of knowledge. We must  grant that on this point that old poet Plato showed a keener sense of  facts when he proclaimed that geometry was non-empirical, not only  because of its certainty, nor mainly because of its deductive struc­ ture, but because of the ostensibly non-empirical nature of its subject­ matter, its points and lines and planes. Mach attempts to explain  geometrical idealization psychologically:  The same economic impulse that prompts our children to retain only the typical  features in their concepts and drawings, leads us also to the schematization and  conceptual idealization of the images derived from our experience. Although we never  come across in nature a perfect straight line or an exact circle, in our thinking we  nevertheless designedly abstract from the deviations which thus occur. "Xl  Economy may indeed justify the use of idealization but it cannot  explain its possibility. We would be hard put indeed to say how we  can recognize and eliminate observed "deviations" from the ideal  figures, unless we know beforehand what they deviate from. A few  passages show, however, that Mach was ready to go beyond the  classical empiricist posture and to acknowledge our intellectual apti­ tude for autonomously generating concepts: The choice of our  geometric concepts is suggested by empirical facts, but it finally rests  upon the free elaboration of those facts by thought. This intellectual  freedom in the formation of concepts is indeed required for their  eventual ordering in a deductive system: "For our logical mastery  extends only to those concepts of which we have ourselves deter­ mined the contents.,,101 In this, however, geometry does not differ  from mathematical physics. Like the latter, it becomes an exact  deductive science only through the representation of empirical ob­ jects by means of schematic, idealizing concepts. "Just as mechanics  can assert the constancy of masses or reduce the interactions be­ tween bodies to simple accelerations only within the limits of errors of  observation, so likewise the existence of straight lines, planes, the  amount of the angle sum, etc., can be maintained only on a similar  restriction. ,,102 The imperfect correspondence between geometrical  concepts and empirical facts has one important implication:  Different ideas can express the facts with the same exactness in the domain accessible  to observation. The facts must hence be carefully distinguished from the intellectual </p><div id="pagenum"><p>constructs the formation of which they suggested. The latter -the concepts -must be </p></div><div id="pagenum"><p>EMPIRICISM, APRIORISM, CONVENTIONALISM 285 </p></div><p id="page">consistent with observation, and must in addition be logically in accord with one  another. Now, these two requirements can be fulfilIed in more than one manner, and  hence the different systems of geometry.103  This ambiguity is shared by geometry with physics, but, in Mach's  opinion, the former has one signal advantage over the latter. While  the ideal concepts of physics, such as the concept of a perfect gas,  can be experimentally realized only up to a certain point, beyond  which they require adjustment, "we can conceive a sphere, a plane,  etc., constructed with unlimited exactness, without running counter to  any fact" .104  From this, Mach concludes that if the progress of physical  experience should eventually require us to modify our scientific  concepts, we will rather sacrifice the less perfect concepts of physics,  than the simpler, more perfect, firmer concepts of geometry. Scien­ tists can therefore rest assured that they will never need to replace  Euclidean geometry in their descriptions of phenomena. This surpris­ ingly conservative conclusion is followed immediately by a no less  startlingly revolutionary statement. Physicists, says Mach, can benefit  in another sense from the study of unorthodox geometries.  Our geometry refers always to objects of sensuous experience. But the moment we  begin to operate with mere things of thought like atoms and molecules, which from  their very nature can never be made the objects of sensuous contemplation, we are  under no obligation whatever to think of them as standing in spatial relationships which  are peculiar to the Euclidean three-dimensional space of our sensuous experiencelO~  In other words, if we postulate invisible, intangible objects for  explaining perceived phenomena, we need not feel compelled to  locate those objects in Euclidean 3-space. On the contrary, we are  free to set them in any geometrical framework we think fit. Since  Mach was read by most young German physicists in the first quarter  of the 20th century, it is not unlikely that passages like this one have  positively contributed to liberate dynamics from its dependence on  classical geometry and kinematics.  4.2 THE UPROAR OF BOEOTIANS  4.2.1 Hermann Lotze  The uproar Gauss had feared came after his death. The strongest </p><div id="pagenum"><p>protests were made by philosophers who would not admit any </p></div><div id="pagenum"><p>286 CHAPTER 4 </p></div><p id="page">tampering with Euclidean geometry, the established paradigm of  scientific knowledge. Many of the objections raised against the novel  geometric conceptions merely showed ignorance (and a remarkable  readiness to believe mathematicians guilty of the wildest nonsense).  Thus, Albrecht Krause, in his book Kant und Helmholtz (1876),  observes that "lines, surfaces and the axes of bodies in space have a  direction and consequently a curvature, but space as such has no  direction because everything directed lies in space, and therefore it  has no curvature; this is not the same as to say that it has a curvature  equal to zero".l In his Grenzen der Philosophie (1875), W. Tobias  rebukes Riemann for believing in the possibility "that the observable  world with its actually existing three dimensions ends at an incalcul­ able distance from the earth, where another cosmic space (Welten­ raum) begins, with a different curvature and perhaps with more than  three dimensions". 2 Not all critics were so obscure as Krause and  Tobias. The Boeotian chorus was joined by some highly regarded  thinkers, such as Lotze and Wundt in Germany and Renouvier in  France.  Hermann Lotze (1817-1881) is perhaps the most noteworthy among  late 19th-century German philosophical system-builders. To his mind,  the new geometric speculations were "just one big connected  mistake".3 His criticism of them is set in the context of his metaphy­ sical theory of space. This theory, like Erdmann's, is conceived in  terms of the duality of Mind and Things. According to Lotze, space  can exist only as space intuition, that is, only insofar as the Mind is  aware of it.4 But space is not a mere appearance to which nothing  corresponds in Reality (im Reel/en). "Every particular trait of our  spatial intuitions corresponds to something that is its ground in the  world of things." But such ground does not in any way resemble  spatial relations. "Not relations, spatial or intelligible, between things,  but only immediate interactions, which things inflict one another as  internal states, are the actual fact whose perception is woven by us  into a spatial phenomenon.,,5 This conception of space raises three  questions:  (i) Why must the soul intuit the variegated impressions it receives  from things -which originally can be only non-spatial states of mind - under the form of a spatial expanse (eines riwmlichen Nebeneinan­ ders)? This question admits of no answer. The spatial character of </p><div id="pagenum"><p>our perception of things must be taken as an inexplicable fact of life, </p></div><div id="pagenum"><p>EMPIRICISM, APRIORISM, CONVENTIONALISM 287 </p></div><p id="page">like the perception of air-waves as sounds or of light-waves as  colours.  (ii) What inner states are organized by the soul in this peculiar  form? What conditions govern the assignment of a definite spatial  position to each particular sense-impression? These questions are the  subject of Lotze's theory of local signs, which need not concern us  here.  (iii) Which is the geometric structure of the full expanse developed  by drawing every consequence that is necessitated or permitted by  the given nature of the original intuition of space? Mathematicians  have hitherto answered this question by reasoning deductively from  unhesitatingly accepted premises. These they take from what they  call intuition. This procedure has given rise to Euclidean geometry,  which, Lotze says, was never questioned until modern times. Recent  speculations on the matter compel him, however, to deal with the  question of geometric structure in his metaphysical treatise.  Lotze believes that doubts concerning the validity of Euclidean  geometry are motivated by the philosophical thesis that space is  purely subjective. Space, as we know it, may be conceived as a  special case of the more general concept of an "order system of  empty places".6 Nothing prevents us from conceiving several  different species of this generic concept, structured by other rules  than those that govern space. Other beings might exist, who perceive  the same world of things as we do, but under one of these alternative  order systems. It is possible that they perceive in a different fashion  the same aspects of things which we perceive in space, or that the  peculiar structure of their intuition enables them to perceive other  aspects of things, which are inaccessible to us. Lotze will not dispute  these possibilities. There is, in fact, no way of knowing whether they  are fulfilled or not. But Lotze emphatically rejects the contention that  other beings, unknown to us, could have a spatial intuition different  from ours.  It might seem at first sight that this is merely a matter of words. We  may just as well reserve the name space for the order system of our  own perception of things. Riemann himself had done so. But accord­ ing to Riemann we cannot be sure that this order system is adequately  represented by Euclidean geometry. Most probably it is not, since  many other such order systems are possible, and our perceptions are </p><div id="pagenum"><p>far too imprecise for us to determine exactly which is true of space. </p></div><div id="pagenum"><p>288 CHAPTER 4 </p></div><p id="page">Lotze has apparently missed the point. If r denotes a straight line and  w an angle, as intuited by us, then, Lotze maintains, rand w as  elements of space determine its global configuration and internal  structure completely and unambiguously in full agreement with tradi­ tional geometry. "It would be unfair to demand another proof of it  than the one provided by the actual development of science until  now.,,7 That the elements rand w admit of other combinations that  are not made intuitive in our space and that such combinations are  not just verbally describable abstract possibilities, but lead to spatial  intuitions different from our own, can only be proved by actually  producing the intuitions.  Lotze believes that the Euclidean system is a perfectly satisfactory  expression of our space intuition and he will not enter into any  discussion on this matter. He knows that the theory of parallels is  regarded by many as a weak spot in the Euclidean system. That the  theory rests upon an undemonstrable postulate is, of course, no  objection to it. Geometry, as a description of intuition, is necessarily  built upon undemonstrable premises. Like other philosophers before  him, Lotze thinks that he can improve the intuitive obviousness of  Euclid's theory by redefining parallels. He provides two new  definitions, which he apparently believes to be equivalent:  [il We call two straight lines a and b parallel if they have the same direction in  space, and we verify that their direction is the same if a and b make the same angle w  with a third line c on the same plane e and towards the same side s.  [iiI a and b are parallel if the endpoints Q and R of any pair of equal segments OQ and  PR, measured on a and b from their [respective) origins 0 and P, lie at the same distance  from each other. 8  We know that these definitions are not equivalent and that none of  them is equivalent to Euclid's. The first definition implies, of course,  that b is the only parallel to a on plane e through the meet of band c;  but it does not imply that b is the only straight line which fulfils the  italicized condition but does not meet a. The second definition does  not guarantee that parallel lines are straight. If we include this  requirement we must prove (or postulate) that such lines exist. Lotze  probably regarded it as intuitively obvious.  Lotze was, as far as I know, the first one to make the following  important remark, which Poincare later used in support of con­</p><div id="pagenum"><p>ventionalism. In Euclidean geometry, the three internal angles of a </p></div><div id="pagenum"><p>EMPIRICISM, APRIORISM, CONVENTIONALISM 289 </p></div><p id="page">triangle are equal to two right angles. This fact, Lotze claims, is not  subject to experimental verification or refutation. If astronomical  measurements of very large distances showed that the three angles of  a triangle add up to less than two right angles, we would conclude that  a hitherto unknown kind of refraction has deviated the light-rays that  form the sides of the observed triangle. In other words, we would  conclude that physical reality in space behaves in a peculiar way, but  not that space itself shows properties which contradict all our in­ tuitions and are not backed by an exceptional intuition of its own.9  Lotze completes his discussion of modern philosophico-geometrical  speculations with a criticism of some of the concepts which turn up in  them, such as intrinsic geometry, fourth dimension, space curvature.  Lotze's remarks suggest that he had not actually studied the works of  Gauss and Riemann, but tried to reconstruct their meaning proprio  Marte from a few vague hints. Thus, in his opinion, it is impossible to  define or measure a curve without presupposing the intuition of the  straight line from which that curve deviates. (Lotze, M, p.246). Lotze  is probably thinking of the classical definition of the length of a curve  as the limit of a sequence of lengths of polygonal lines inscribed in it  (see p.69). But this definition had been discarded by Riemann when he  demanded that every line should measure every other line (Riemann,  H, p.12; see p.90f.). Lotze discusses Helmholtz's Flatland at  length. He maintains that a two-dimensional rational being living upon  a surface would develop the notion of a third dimension in order to  understand the fact that straightest lines in his world return upon  themselves. That notion would arise in him, not as a product of  immediate perception, "sondern auf Grund des unertraglichen  Widerspruchs, der in dieser sich selbst wiedererreichenden Geraden  Iage" (Lotze, M, p.252). Now, I do not see why!, if we are willing to  grant Helmholtz's fiction, we cannot also admiJ that straightest lines  in spherical Flatland are ordered cyclically like; projective lines. It is  difficult to make sense of Lotze's refutation of the fourth dimension  (Lotze, M, pp.254-260). It rests upon the notion that the number of  dimensions of a space is equal to the number of mutually orthogonal  straight lines that meet at an arbitrary point of it. Lotze maintains that  this number cannot possibly exceed three. He apologizes for his in­ ability to substantiate this claim with stronger arguments than the one  proposed by him (Lotze, M, p.257; Lotze's argument is explained and </p><div id="pagenum"><p>criticized in Russell, FG, p.l06f.). His discussion of space curvature </p></div><div id="pagenum"><p>290 CHAPTER 4 </p></div><p id="page">is quite remarkable. He apparently believes that a three-dimen­ sional space with a positive curvature is constructed onion wise out of  many curved surfaces. It is then easy to show that no such space  exists; thus, for instance, the space built from the spheres centred at  point P, whose radii take all real values, is none other than ordinary  Euclidean flat 3-space. "Fur jede der in Gedanken an diesem Raume  unterscheidbaren, in ihm selbst aber vollig ausgeloschten Oberfliichen  hat der Begriff eines Krummungsmasses seinen guten und bekannten  Sinn; aber es ist unmoglich, sich eine Eigenschaft des Raumes zu  denken, auf die er Anwendung finden konnte." (Lotze, M, p.263).  Lotze finally criticizes Riemann's concept of a space with variable  curvature, wherein rigid bodies do not enjoy free mobility. An in­ homogeneous space, some of whose parts are structurally different  from the others "would contradict its own concept and would not be  what it ought to be, namely, the neutral background for the variegated  relations of that which is ordered in it". (Lotze, M, p.266). Spaces  which by their very structure do not admit at one place a figure which  can be constructed at another place "can only be conceived as real  shells or walls, whose resistance denies admission to an approaching  real form, but which can be eventually broken by the increasing  impact of the latter (durch den he/tigeren An/all dieser mussten  zersprengt werden konnen)." (Lotze, M, p.266). Lotze's criticism of  the new geometric concepts is not untypical of a certain kind of  philosophical literature. It may help understand why many scientists  are impatient of philosophy.  Lotze's metaphysics of space is very similar to Erdmann's but their  philosophies of geometry are conspicuously different. Both authors  hold space to be the peculiar form in which the human mind perceives  the things acting upon it. Both believe -though not for the same  reasons -that this form is wholly foreign to things themselves, but  they both maintain that the spatial properties and relations of sense  appearances are necessarily grounded on the non-spatial properties  and relations of things. Though Erdmann quotes Klein's Erlangen  Programme and Lotze regards space as an order system of empty  places, they have not grasped the potentialities of the structural  viewpoint. They fail to see that the same order system whose empty  places are filled by sense-appearances could also be embodied in the  world of things. Space, as conceived by Erdmann and Lotze, posses­</p><div id="pagenum"><p>ses a definite geometrical structure. Since this structure is contingent </p></div><div id="pagenum"><p>EMPIRICISM, APRIORISM, CONVENTION ALISM 291 </p></div><p id="page">upon the factual nature of the Mind and no 'transcendental deduction'  of it is attempted,1O we must conclude that it can only be known  empirically. At this point, the ways of Erdmann and Lotze diverge.  The former holds that we can know the actual structure of space only  approximately, by studying spatial phenomena, while the latter main­ tains that Euclidean geometry provides an irrefutable exact descrip­ tion of that structure. Lotze's claim is consonant with the philoso­ phical prejudice that self-knowledge is absolutely evident and indis­ putable. Lotze apparently believes that the geometrical images which  we can form with closed eyes are perfectly definite and possess an  inner necessity of their own, independently of our experiences with  physical objects. Geometrical concepts merely reflect what we 'see' in  those images, instead of determining or regulating them.  4.2.2 Wilhelm Wundt  As early as 1877, Wilhelm Wundt (1832-1920) criticized the use of  non-Euclidean geometries for grinding philosophical axes.ll His final  position on the matter is stated in the 4th edition of his Logik (1919,  1920).12 "Space" is, first of all, the name for "the immediately given  order of our sense perceptions".13 This is also called our intuition of  space (Raumanschauung). It is due to "the actualization of original  conditions of our physical and mental organization" .14 As such, it may  be regarded as "a necessary form of intuition." But its necessity is  not the expression of an inborn idea, "but the result of the constancy  with which all sensations referred to external objects are bound to  their spatial order".15 Since space is originally given as an order of  sensations, but is not itself a sensation, we can grasp this order  abstractly and thus develop the concept of objective space. This is not  immediately given to us, but we arrive at it by eliminating in thought  "the subjective components involved in every particular spatial in­ tuition". 16 By thus freeing space from all ingredients whose subjective  origin has been established, we obtain "the conceptual order of an  objectively given manifold corresponding to that intuitive form".17  The determination of the concept of objective space is the task of  geometry. Geometry is therefore unquestionably an empirical science.  However, this does not detract from its apodictic validity. "The  proposition that empirical statements are never apodictic is ground­ less." "If there are any experiences which have no exceptions, we </p><div id="pagenum"><p>must regard them as necessary. Spatial representations are among the </p></div><div id="pagenum"><p>292 CHAPTER 4 </p></div><p id="page">experiences which are free from exceptions. They must be viewed as  the inalterable ingredients of every external experience [ ... ]. The  unexceptionable empirical validity of geometrical propositions is thus  a sufficient ground for their necessity. ,,18  Modern mathematics rightly places the concept of objective space  among many other related concepts, all of which are comprised under  the general notion of a manifold. This has given rise to the mistaken  belief that these other concepts can also be associated, like the  former, to an intuition. Wundt emphatically rejects this idea.  We can only represent to ourselves as a simultaneously given manifold, the space of  our intuition with some concrete contents, which we regard as homogeneous and  indifferent. and which we can use. by subjecting it to a different ordering, for  constructing a different representable manifold. Every space which differs from that  space is the object of a conceptual abstraction or of an analogy based on a conceptual  abstraction; in either case, the concepts thus developed do not agree with our actual  repre sen tations .19  Our thought can ignore some definite properties of reality or it can transfer notes from  some definite concepts to other concepts. But these operations do not have the slightest  power to change anything in real facts. For this reason, we cannot allow the supposi­ tion that astronomical or physical experiences might teach us some day that our  geometrical system is not valid in some regions of the universe.2o The order of the  objects of the real world according to the laws of our three-dimensional flat geometry  [ ... J is the factual expression of the real order of phenomena, which cannot, as such,  be replaced by any other order.21  No arguments are given by Wundt to support these claims. Surpris­ ingly enough, he defines the concept of objective space in terms that  are in fact compatible with BL geometry: "Space is a continuous  self-congruent infinite quantity wherein indivisible particulars are  detennined by three directions. ,,22  Wundt has realised that the subject-matter of Euclidean geometry,  "the concept of objective space", though based in our space intuition,  is not identical with it. But he continues to think that the intuitively  grasped "order of sense perceptions" exactly corresponds to that  concept. This is highly questionable. Wundt's "order of sense  perceptions" is not the same as the so-called perceptual fields in  which the data of the several senses are thought to be separately  ordered. He obviously conceives it as a unified order system, com­ mon to all sense-data. But if it is meaningful to speak of such a  common order of sense-data (not, mark you, of things known </p><div id="pagenum"><p>through them), it certainly will not resemble the infinite Euclidean </p></div><div id="pagenum"><p>EMPIRICISM, APRIORISM, CONVENTIONALISM 293 </p></div><p id="page">space. No sense-data can be located beyond those tiny twinkling  spots which children call stars, which are all affixed on a dark  hemisphere that meets the ground at the horizon. Wundt reasserts the  thesis, first stated by Kant, that unorthodox geometries depend  parasitically on Euclidean geometry, because they must avail them­ selves of our ordinary intuition of space.23 Now, even if the last  statement were true, it would not suffice to validate that thesis. A  geometrical theory may concern structural properties of intuitive  space which are not peculiar to Euclidean geometry. Thus, for  example, spherical trigonometry, insofar as it reflects our spatial  intuitions, cannot be said to depend on their Euclidean nature, for it  agrees equally well with spherical or with BL geometry.  Like other empiricists before him, Wundt does not ignore the fact  that no perceived entities exactly correspond to the basic geometrical  concepts. These cannot be formed by ordinary abstraction, by which  we merely disregard some of the properties of perceived objects,  "because points, straight lines and planes, as they are presupposed by  geometry, do not exist objectively, neither in isolation nor in connec­ tion with other objective properties of bodies" .24 Instead of speaking,  like some of his predecessors, of idealization, Wundt proposes a  completely different approach to mathematical concept formation. In  mathematical abstraction, he says, we deliberately ignore all the  objective properties of things and we pay attention only to "the  logical function of grasping them (die logische Funktion ihrer  AUf/assung)".25 Unfortunately, Wundt does not explain what this  means nor how it applies to the vast realm of mathematical concepts.  While dismissing Poincare's doctrine of the conventionality of  metrics, Wundt defyingly proclaims that dimension number is con­ ventional. This is indisputably true if we define dimension number, as  he does, by "the number of elements required to determine the  position of a point in space".26 Since R3 can be bijectively mapped  onto Rn (for every positive integral value of n), any number of real  coordinates can be used to specify a particular point in space. But this  is not the reason given by Wundt to support his claim. He mentions  the fact that if we regard space as the set of its straight lines, instead  of viewing it as the set of its points, we shall need four coordinates,  instead of three, for determining each element of space. Now, if S  denotes space regarded as the set of its points, the set of straight lines </p><div id="pagenum"><p>of S is not S itself but a subset of the power set 2P(S), so that Wundt's </p></div><div id="pagenum"><p>294 CHAPTER 4 </p></div><p id="page">argument fails to prove that the same set can be viewed indifferently  as having three or four dimensions (in Wundt's sense). Dimension  number is defined after Brouwer (1913) as a topological property,  ascribable to a wide variety of topological spaces (Section 4.4.6). If a  set S with topology T has dimension n, it is generally possible to  define on S a topology T', which makes S into an m-dimensional  topological space (m f:. n). From this point of view, the dimension  number of physical space can be regarded as conventional if, but only  if, we are free to endow it with several incompatible topologies,  which bestow on it different dimension numbers.  4.2.3 Charles Renouvier  Charles Renouvier (1815-1903), head of the French Neokantian  school, developed his views on the old and the new geometries in an  essay entitled "La philo sophie de la regie et du compas".27 It aims at  "demonstrating the illogical character of non-Euclidean geometry".28  This aim is directly pursued in the second half of the essay, devoted  to "the sophisms of general geometry". Renouvier carries his ani­ mosity towards the new geometries to the point of saying that  "anyone who believes that he may question the objective foundation  of the old geometry [ ... ] cannot consistently think that the objective  foundation of morality is better safeguarded against doubt.,,29 The  "illogical character" of non-Euclidean geometry is conceived rather  broadly. Renouvier grants that BL geometry is exempt from  contradiction. Indeed if BL geometry were contradictory, Euclid's  fifth postulate would be a demonstrable truth, instead of an indemon­ strable principle of geometry. The contradictory, however, is only a  species of the absurd, a much vaster genus of inadmissible notions  and untrue propositions, including, in particular, "the ideas and pro­ positions which contradict the regulative principles of the under­ standing". BL geometry belongs precisely to the latter variety of the  absurd, "because it rests on the supposition that one of the principal  laws of our representation of space and figures does not express a  real relation".30 The actual development of an absurd but noncon­ tradictory geometry by Lobachevsky provides a welcome confirma­ tion of Kant's thesis that some of tile principles of geometry are  synthetic judgments, in other words, that geometry must be based on  undemonstrable postulates. </p><div id="pagenum"><p>For Renouvier, the ultimate foundation of geometry is intuition. He </p></div><div id="pagenum"><p>EMPIRICISM. APRIORISM. CONVENTION ALISM 295 </p></div><p id="page">thus calls the "ideas of space and spatial relations insofar as they  consist of intellectual phenomena which can be analyzed, no doubt,  and from which consequences can be drawn, but which cannot be  demonstrated nor reduced to other phenomena without begging the  question.,,31 In contrast with Kant, who restricted analysis to the  elucidation of concepts, and regarded spatial intuition as the s'Ource of  a priori synthetic judgments, Renouvier maintains that the contents of  intuition is expressed in analytic judgments, and treats intuitive and  analytic as synonymous. The first "fact of intuition" which lies at the  foundation of geometry is three-dimensional space itself (l'etendue  elle-meme, a trois dimensions), "in which every figure is imagined,  defined in its internal relations and placed by the mind as in a  shapeless medium (comme en un milieu lui-meme sans figure)". This  primary fact of intuition immediately implies, according to Renouvier,  that "a figure can be transported everywhere in space, without  altering its elements or the relations of its parts".32 This "law of the  conservation of figures" -which is tantamount to Helmholtz's free  mobility of rigid bodies -"contains in principle every other fact of  geometrical intuition". Does it suffice to determine the Euclidean  character of true geometry? On this point, Renouvier's position is  ambiguous. On the one hand, he maintains that Euclidean geometry  cannot be established by analysis alone, but demands an intellectual  synthesis, which apparently operates upon intuitive data but is  somehow superimposed on them. Thus, while the statement that two  straight lines never enclose a space merely analyzes, in Renouvier's  opinion, the intuitive notion of a straight line (defined as a line of  constant direction), the statement that the straight line is the shortest  between two points involves a synthesis which can only be due to the  understanding. On the other hand, when he discusses Riemann and  Helmholtz, he concludes that the "law of conservation of figures" is  fulfilled only in Euclidean space.  This conclusion is somewhat deviously stated at the end of p.52.  Renouvier quotes from Helmholtz (1866). He does not seem to be  aware of the big mistake in that work (corrected in Helmholtz, 1869;  see p.162 of this book). Helmholtz had ignored BL geometry, main­ taining that free mobility is compatible only with Euclidean and  spherical geometry. Since the latter is automatically excluded by  Renouvier's contention that it is analytically true that two straight </p><div id="pagenum"><p>lines cannot enclose a space, Renouvier's conclusion, though false, is </p></div><div id="pagenum"><p>296 CHAPTER 4 </p></div><p id="page">certainly not unreasonable. But his own statement of it reveals a  misunderstanding which it is harder to excuse. Renouvier apparently  believes that Riemann's line element (the square root of a quadratic  differential expression) is true only of Euclidean space (see Renou­ vier, loco cit., pp.49, 52, and also p.297 of this book). If this were so,  of course, Helmholtz's proof that the requirement of free mobility of  rigid bodies leads to Riemann's definition of the line element would  imply that free mobility is incompatible with a non-Euclidean space.  If the law of conservation of figures is obtained by an analysis of  intuition and if it implies that space is Euclidean, ordinary geometry is  analytically true of the intuitively given space, and synthetic judg­ ments, in Renouvier's sense, play no role in its foundation. Neverthe­ less, throughout most of his essay, Renouvier remains faithful to his  initially stated position and insists in the synthetic, indemonstrable  nature of certain basic geometric truths, such as the postulate that the  straight line defined by two points is the shortest line that joins them  or the postulate that all right angles are equal. Among the indemon­ strable, synthetic principles of geometry, he counts the following  postulate, from which -if we assume the Archimedean postulate­ Euclid's fifth postulate can be derived:  Let AI>"" An denote the vertices of a. convex polygon of n sides A,A"  A,A 3, ... ,AnA,. Let m be a straight line which initially covers AnA, and is suc­ cessively rotated about the points AI> A" ... , A" so that after the jth rotation it covers  AjA J+, (l,,; j < n) and after the nth rotation it returns to its initial position. The angles  described by m at A" A" .... An add up to four right angles.33  Renouvier takes this for an equivalent of the parallel postulate, which  he apparently prefers to the traditional formulations because it brings  out more Clearly its quantitative import. The postulate is thus placed  on a par with the two manifestly quantitative postulates we  mentioned earlier. But Renouvier's attack against BL geometry is not  directly based on his version of the parallel postulate, but on one of  its equivalents, namely, the existence of similar figures of unequal  size. No such figures can exist if we deny the postulate. But this,  Renouvier believes, would bring about "the total ruin of geometrical  thought".34 Size would be absolute, not relative to the choice of a  unit. This he regards as absurd. "Since every measurement is the  determination of a relation and the numbers which give the quan­</p><div id="pagenum"><p>titative values vary in proportion to the quantity of the arbitrarily </p></div><div id="pagenum"><p>EMPIRICISM, APRIORISM, CONVENTION ALiSM 297 </p></div><p id="page">chosen unit of each kind, every quantity of a given kind can be  multiplied by the same factor without changing anything in their  comparative sizes, which is all that can be grasped by our senses,  imagination and reason. ,,35 Consequently, the multiplication of linear  dimensions by an arbitrary constant should not alter the geometrical  properties of figures. It is not easy to see why this argument does not  apply to the size of angles; why, for instance, if we try to duplicate  every angle of a triangle, we do not merely distort the triangle but we  downright destroy it. (See p.31?)  After a long diatribe against other aspects of general geometry -in  particular against Riemann's concept of a manifold -Renouvier ends  upon a conciliatory note. There is no objection to the new geometry if  its cultivators acknowledge that their only aim "is to exercise them­ selves in mathematical analyses of diverse hypotheses, without pay­ ing attention to any truth except that regarding the relation between  conclusions and their premises".36 In view of the preceding discussion,  one should certainly expect Renouvier to prove that Euclidean  geometry differs essentially from the non-Euclidean systems in this  respect; to show, in other words, that Euclidean geometry cares for  something more than just logical consequence. Such proof is nowhere  to be found in Renouvier's essay (unless we regard the above  argument concerning similar figures as providing it).  Renouvier tends to be quite unreliable when it comes to technical  matters. We mentioned on p.296 his incredible confusion regarding  Riemann's line element. Renouvier's position on this point can be  formally stated as follows: given an R-manifold M with metric J.L,  there exists a chart x defined on all M, such that J.L(iJ/iJxi, iJ/iJx i) =  .5; (i.e. 1 if i = j, 0 if i'l-j). This means, of course, that every  R-manifold is a Euclidean space! On p.54, Renouvier refers to BL  geometry (without naming it) as a theory which contests "the im­ possibility of following, upon a plane, from a given point, several  straight lines having the same direction as a given line". Now,  according to Renouvier, two straight lines have the same direction if  they make equal corresponding angles with a transversal. But, unless  the parallel postulate is true, lines making equal corresponding angles  with a given transversal might make different corresponding angles  with a different transversal. The denial of the stated impossibility is  not therefore so preposterous as Renouvier thinks. Unless Postulate 5 </p><div id="pagenum"><p>is true, given a line m and a point P outside it, several lines n, n I, ••• </p></div><div id="pagenum"><p>298 CHAPTER 4 </p></div><p id="page">through P may be said to have the same direction as m, relatively to  different transversals t, t'. (See our discussion of Ueberweg on  p.263f.)  4.2.4 Joseph Delboeuf  The Belgian professor J. Delboeuf (1831-1896) is not so well-known  as Lotze, Wundt or Renouvier; but his ideas about geometry and  science are, in some respects, more interesting than theirs. We have  already mentioned his Proiegomenes philosophiques a la geometrie  (1860).37 Thirty-five years later, he returned to the subject in four  articles on "The old and the new geometries", published in the Revue  Philosophique. Delboeuf's thought cannot be easily classed with a  philosophical school. I have chosen to deal with him here because he  maintains that general geometry, as expounded by Calinon and  Lechalas (Section 4.1.4), does not encompass Euclidean geometry as  a special case, but is subordinate to it. In my opinion, he fails to  substantiate this claim, which is apparently based on a misunder­ standing; but other theses explained in those articles and in the earlier  book deserve a close attention.  Unfortunately, Delboeuf's basic epistemological views are not very  clearly set forth by him. He conceives reality as a vast, endlessly  diversified happening. Whatever is here and now differs from what is  there and then. Human intelligence attempts to grasp reality by  ignoring the particular and minding the general. Delboeuf apparently  thinks that this is merely a matter of abstraction, of disregarding some  aspects of phenomena and concentrating upon other aspects. At times  he speaks, however, as if notions thus abstracted from experience  could never attain sufficient generality, so that the mind must posit  ideal facts of its own making in order to build a truly general science.  This is developed by logical deduction from these ideal facts or  hypotheses. The science thus constructed is true if the consequences  derived from the hypotheses agree with real facts.  According to Delboeuf, the first step towards a scientific grasp of  reality consists in regarding the spatio-temporallocus of the universal  happening as homogeneous, in the sense that identical bodies can be  found at different places and identical events can occur at different  times. In this way we obtain the universe of inert things, studied by  physics and chemistry. A second step consists in ignoring the </p><div id="pagenum"><p>differences between the bodies and seeing in them only one and the </p></div><div id="pagenum"><p>EMPIRICISM, APRIORISM, CONVENTIONALISM 299 </p></div><p id="page">same nature, The universe now appears as "an aggregate of bodies  subject to reciprocal actions and reactions; their differences consist  only in the sum of the actions they exert", This is the subject-matter  of mechanics. From this point of view, space and time are still  inhomogeneous, in a way, "in so far as the position of bodies and  their mutual relations change from one moment to the next, from one  place to another" .38 The abstract cause of movement and change, says  Delboeuf, is force. If we ignore the differences, changes and move­ ments which arise from inequalities in force, the universe is reduced  to an aggregate of figures. This is the subject-matter of geometry. The  space to which geometrical figures belong is absolutely homogeneous,  in a double sense. In the first place, if we are given a figure lying  about a point in space we can always find another equal (i.e.  congruent) figure lying in any way whatsoever about another point.  This property Delboeuf calls isogeneity. In the second place, any  figure can be increased or reduced in size while preserving its shape.  This property Delboeuf calls homogeneity. Euclidean space is homo­ geneous in this strict sense. In his articles of the 1890's, Delboeuf  proudly points out that this character suffices to distinguish it among  all spaces conceived by general geometry, whose subsequent  development he had not anticipated when, in 1860, he described "the  mutual independence of shape and size" as the first principle of  geometry.39  Delboeuf repeatedly claims that his notion of homogeneous space  is obtained, in the manner described, by abstraction. To my mind, this  is not altogether clear. Indeed, I fail to see why a spatial figure,  conceived by ignoring every peculiarity of a body, must possess a  shape independent of its size. But homogeneous space can, of course,  be freely posited, and its properties can be deduced from its definition  and compared with those of real space. On this point, Delboeuf is  clear enough. Geometric space, whether we regard it as posited or as  abstracted from reality, is a far cry from real space. It should not  surprise us to find that, in nature, no line is absolutely straight, no  circle is perfect, no ellipse is exact. "How could we draw a circle in  heterogeneous space and time, if the arms of the compass expand or  contract from one moment to another, from one place to another, due  to the ceaseless variations of temperature; if the points are worn, the  paper is not flat, etc. ?,,40 Delboeuf's first article on the old and the </p><div id="pagenum"><p>new geometries aims at showing that real space is utterly different </p></div><div id="pagenum"><p>300 CHAPTER 4 </p></div><p id="page">from Euclidean space. Most of his arguments are highly questionable,  but the main one is worthy of consideration. "Real space is nowhere  identical with itself; it does not admit equal figures; the smallest grain  of sand, the smallest speck of dust in space are altered by the  slightest displacement. [ ... J Real space is necessarily variable and  none of its parts will ever return to a state through which it has gone  once.,,41 In the light of these statements it is hard to understand why  Delboeuf insists on the privileged status of Euclidean geometry. Why  not allow that other concepts of space, departing from strict homo­ geneity, can be legitimately posited, and that real space may even  agree better with them than with homogeneous space? Delboeuf  apparently had not read Riemann. He seems to be acquainted only  with maximally symmetric spaces (through the mathematical works of  Calinon and Lechalas). Speaking about spaces of constant positive or  negative curvature, he rightly observes that  they are artificial spaces, just like Euclidean space; from this point of view, they are no  less geometric than the latter. But they possess no special quality that would enable  them to represent real space better than it does. Real space [ ... J certainly has a  curvature, but this curvature is different at each one of its points and it changes at  every moment. Real figures, that is, bodies, change in it with time and place. The  constant curvatures of meta-Euclidean spaces are therefore just as far from reality as  the homogeneity of Euclidean space,42  Was Delboeuf aware of the full import of his words? Taken literally,  they are an invitation to physicists to discard Euclidean geometry and  to tryout a space of variable curvature to represent physical space.  But Delboeuf does not pursue this idea any further. His declared aim  is to establish the absolute preeminence of the "old" over the "new"  geometry (which, as I said, he apparently knows only in the guise of  spherical and BL geometry). His lengthy argument for proving this  amounts in the end to the following: (i) Euclidean geometry is the sole  guarantee of the consistency of non-Euclidean geometries. (ii) The  geodetic arc, which, in non-Euclidean geometries, plays the same  fundamental role as the straight segment plays in ordinary geometry,  can only be defined in terms of the Euclidean straight line. Both  statements are false. The second one rests on the (mistaken) charac­ terization of a geodetic arc as the shortest line joining its extremes  and on the classical definition of the length of an arc as the limit of a  sequence of lengths of straight segments. Riemann, as we saw, had </p><div id="pagenum"><p>been able to discard this definition and to substitute for it another one </p></div><div id="pagenum"><p>EMPIRICISM, APRIORISM, CONVENTIONALISM 301 </p></div><p id="page">which in no way presupposes the existence of Euclidean straights in  the manifold to which the arc belongs (Section 2.2.8). The first  statement arises out of a misunderstanding of the true significance of  Beltrami's pseudo spherical model of the BL plane. This model  guarantees the consistency of BL plane geometry quoad nos, because  we are willing to believe that Euclidean space geometry is consistent.  But it is not the only guarantee of that consistency. This can also be  proved, to our satisfaction, by means of numerical models, if we take  the consistency of arithmetic for granted. Numerical models can also  be used for proving the consistency of BL and spherical space  geometry.  4.3 RUSSELL'S APRIORISM OF 1897  4.3.1 The Transcendental Approach  An Essay on the Foundations of Geometry (1897) was the first in the  long series of books published by Bertrand Russell (1873-1970). It is  based on the dissertation he submitted at the Fellowship Examination  of Trinity College, Cambridge in 1895, when he was twenty-two years  old. As it so often happens in philosophy, Russell's ideas look very  attractive in their broad lines, but turn out to be quite disappointing  when worked out in detail. Russell very soon abandoned the philoso­ phical position maintained in the book, which was not reissued until  1956, when the author, at 83, was a living classic, and everything  published under his name was rightly regarded as deserving atten­ tion.1 The book reflects a much more accurate knowledge of the new  geometries than any of the writings we have discussed in Part 4.2. Its  historical Chapters I and II are still useful, and contain valuable  criticisms of the authors we have been studying.2 But our main  concern here is with Chapter III, on the axioms of projective and  metrical geometry, which, as we shall see, promises much more than  it is able to fulfil.  Like most of his contemporaries, Russell believes that the main  task of a philosophy of geometry consists in determining how much in  geometry is necessary, apodictic or a priori knowledge, i.e. knowledge  which under no circumstances can be other than it is, so that no  conceivable experience can ever clash with it. Russell characterizes a  priori knowledge in the best Kantian vein, as knowledge of the </p><div id="pagenum"><p>conditions required by all experience or by a definite genus of </p></div><div id="pagenum"><p>302 CHAPTER 4 </p></div><p id="page">experience. The psychological concept of the a priori as 'the sub­ jective', i.e. as knowledge arising from the nature of our minds (a  concept which can be traced back to Kant's less felicitous texts),  Russell dismisses as philosophically irrelevant. Indeed, such know­ ledge could hardly be said to be necessary, unless we could prove that  this or that aspect of our mental functions cannot be exercised in a  different way; but such proof would establish that the knowledge in  question is a priori in the former objective, 'logical' or 'transcen­ dental' sense. Russell's declared aim is to show that projective  geometry (PG) and the general metric geometry of n-dimensional  maximally symmetric spaces (GMG) are entirely a priori. On the  other hand, the fact that physical space has exactly three dimensions  and that its (necessarily constant) curvature is approximately equal to  zero is, according to Russell, a contingent empirical fact.  The a priori nature of a branch of geometry will be established if  we can (i) find the axioms from which every proposition of that  branch of geometry can be derived by ordinary logical deduction; (ii)  show that these axioms state general conditions of the possibility of  experience, or of a definite genus of experience -in other words, if  we can give a transcendental deduction of the axioms themselves.  Such is, indeed, Russell's programme. He submits two lists of three  axioms each for PG and GMG. He assumes that every kind of  experience involves awareness of diversity in unity. This requires at  least one "principle of differentiation", something, that is, by which  whatever is experienced is distinguished as diverse. "This element,  taken in isolation, and abstracted from the contents which it differen­ tiates, we may call a form of externality.,,3 Russell claims that the  axioms of PG state properties common to every conceivable form of  externality. GMG, on the other hand, has a more restricted scope. Its  axioms express the conditions required for the quantitative deter­ mination of a form of externality. Russell apparently believes that  every form of externality admits a quantitative determination, but he  makes no attempt to prove this. At any rate, if Russell's arguments  are sound, the axioms of GMG, though not necessarily true of all  experience, will certainly govern that kind of quantitative experience,  of experience based on measurement, which is the foundation of  modern natural science.  Russell's transcendental deduction of the axioms of geometry is a </p><div id="pagenum"><p>much more ambitious enterprise than Kant's. The latter claimed in his </p></div><div id="pagenum"><p>EMPIRICISM, APRIQRISM, CONVENTION ALISM 303 </p></div><p id="page">"transcendental exposition of the notion of space" that our ordinary  intuitive representation of space is independent of experience  because it is the source of Euclidean geometry, which he assumed to  be necessarily true.4 But he never attempted to prove that every  particular Euclidean axiom was a necessary condition of every  conceivable experience or of every conceivable quantitative  experience. He acknowledged that we are unable to explain why the  space of our experience has precisely the structure set forth by  Euclid.5 Now, after the new developments in geometry, Kant's tran­ scendental argument for the a priori nature of space is no longer  available. Consistent systems of geometry very different from Eucli­ dean geometry and also from Russell's PG and GMG can be found in  the text-books. If we wish to establish the necessity of a specific,  non-trivial geometrical system, we must give some sort of transcen­ dental proof of its axioms. The failure of Russell's attempt to  demonstrate the necessity of PG and GMG has doubtless contributed  to discredit apriorism in the philosophy of geometry. It seems to me,  however, that if we reason more carefully and less high-handedly  than Russell, we can prove that this or that geometrical theory  necessarily belongs to the conceptual framework presupposed by a  specific, historically known variety of experience (e.g. physical  experience as it was organized in 19th-century laboratories,  astronomical experience as it is gathered in present-day observa­ tories, etc.). But it is very unlikely that a geometrical system less  general than abstract set theory can ever be shown to be a universal  presupposition of all experience.6  4.3.2 The 'Axioms of Projective Geometry'  Let us examine Russell's transcendental deduction of projective  geometry. The reader will wish to know whether it concerns real or  complex projective geometry. In Chapter I, where he deals with the  history of modern geometry, Russell is well aware of the existence of  these two kinds of projective geometry/ but no such awareness is  noticeable in the systematic discussion of Chapter III. Here. pro­ jective geometry is described as dealing "only with the properties  common to all spaces",8 a most remarkable statement, since complex  projective space gllc and real projective space gll" do not have the  same properties, and in both of them every straight line meets every </p><div id="pagenum"><p>other straight line, a property not shared by n-dimensional Euclidean </p></div><div id="pagenum"><p>304 CHAPTER 4 </p></div><p id="page">or BL spaces. But perhaps we are being too pedantic. Russell only  attempts to prove the a priori truth of three principles, which he calls  "the axioms of projective geometry", but which are plainly insufficient  to characterize either g7J C or g7J". These axioms read as follows:  (I) We can distinguish different parts of space, but all parts are qualitatively similar,  and are distinguished only by the immediate fact that they lie outside one another.  (II) Space is continuous and infinitely divisible; the result of infinite division, the  zero of extension, is called a point.  (III) Any two points determine a unique figure, called a straight line, any three in  general determine a unique figure, the plane. Any four determine a corresponding figure  of three dimensions, and for aught that appears to the contrary, the same may be true  of any number of points. But this process comes to an end, sooner or later, with some  number of points which determine the whole of space.9  In the light of Axiom I, each division (in the sense of Axiom II) of  space or of a part of space must consist in its partition into two or  more disjoint but otherwise indiscernible proper parts. Every part  into which division may divide a space is again a space liable to  division in exactly the same terms as any other space. In this axiom  system there are therefore no grounds for the idea that an infinite  sequence of divisions might converge to a definite result. The second  clause of Axiom II is nonsense. That clause, however, is meant to  provide the definition of the term point used in Axiom III. If we wish  to make some sense of Russell's axioms we must take point as a  primitive term and postulate some relationship between it and the  other primitive of the system, namely, space. I suggest that we simply  regard space as the set of all points. to The term continuous in Axiom  II cannot be viewed as primitive. Otherwise, we might just as well  substitute for it any other word or sound, since this is its only  occurrence in the system (it would thus make no difference to write,  for example, (II) Space is slithy and infinitely divisible). This term  must connect the system with other established mathematical  theories. What does it exactly mean? The following translation of the  first sentence of Axiom II into current mathematical language is no  doubt anachronistic but it is probably not too far from Russell's  intended meaning: Space is continuous = Space is a topological space  every point of which has a neighbourhood homeomorphic to R "-I.  Here n (> 1) is the number of points which, according to Axiom III,  suffice to "determine the whole of space". Under this interpretation, </p><div id="pagenum"><p>not every proper subset of space is a part of it in the sense of </p></div><div id="pagenum"><p>EMPIRICISM, APRIORISM, CONVENTIONALISM 305 </p></div><p id="page">Axiom I, since not all subsets of a topological space are qualitatively  similar to each other. A reasonable proposal would be to equate the  parts mentioned in Axiom I to the open simply connected non-empty  subsets of space (all of which are homeomorphic and hence indis­ cernible from a topological point of view). But this conflicts with Axiom  II, since a connected topological space cannot be partitioned into two or  more non-empty open subsets. As a makeshift solution of this difficulty,  I suggest that we regard a part of space in the sense of Axiom I as being  any open simply connected non-empty subset of space, or its closure,  and that we consider two such parts as qualitatively similar if their  interiors are homeomorphic. Some version of Axiom III is usually  included in the standard axiom systems for Euclidean and related  geometries. But then it is followed by other axioms which further  determine the properties of lines, planes, etc. Taken all by itself, the  statement that there exist in space, say, subsets of type A, B, C ... ,  determined, respectively, by two, three, four ... points, is not of much  use.ll  Russell's transcendental deduction of Axioms I-III attempts to  show that they are a prerequisite of all experience because every  conceivable "form of externality" shares the properties which these  three axioms ascribe to space. A successful achievement of this  undertaking would not establish the a priori truth of projective  geometry, in the usual meaning -or meanings -of this expression,  since the latter contains much more than what goes into those axioms.  But it would be a very important epistemological achievement. Un­ fortunately, Russell's execution of the programme leaves much to be  desired.  Let us recall that the expression "form of externality" designates  the element in perception by which perceived things are distinguished  as various, when the said element is taken in isolation and abstracted  from the contents which it differentiates. Russell describes it as the  bare possibility of diversity (of perceived contents) and as the "prin­ ciple of bare diversity". The notion is indeed quite general, and it  would seem that no specific structure can be regarded as necessarily  belonging to a "form of externality" in this sense. On the other hand,  if we conceive such a form less broadly, we shall be able to 'deduce'  that it must have this or that structural property, but we can hardly  claim any necessity for the "form of externality" itself. In order to </p><div id="pagenum"><p>avoid this dilemma, Russell resorts to a standard method of </p></div><div id="pagenum"><p>306 CHAPTER 4 </p></div><p id="page">transcendental deduction, which had been used ad nauseam by  German post-Kantian idealists. This consists in calling the concepts  which play an essential role in the argument by names whose ordinary  meaning is much richer than the defined meaning of those concepts,  and allowing the aura of meaning suggested thereby to strengthen the  premises in which such concepts occur. Since "form of externality" is  introduced by Russell as a defined concept, we ought to be able, in  principle, to give it any name. However, if we substitute, say, the  word 'juggerwogg' for 'form of externality' in all the occurrences  of this expression in Russell's book, Russell's argument is stopped  dead, for it depends on the familiar connotations of 'form' and  'external' in ordinary English.12  Axiom III is understood to mean that space has a finite number of  dimensions, in the sense defined below. This is justified as follows:  Positions, we have seen, are defined solely by their relations to other positions. But in  order that such definition may be possible, a finite number of relations must suffice,  since infinite numbers are philosophically inadmissible. A position must be definable,  therefore, if knowledge of our form is to be possible at all, by some finite integral  number of relations to other positions. Every relation thus necessary for definition, we  call a dimension. Hence we obtain a proposition: Any form of externality must have a  finite integral number of dimensions. 13  Russell argues further that every form of externality worthy of this  name must have more than one dimension. We shall not stop to  examine his argument, but shall only remark that, with Russell's  definition of dimension, the Euclidean plane R2 -and generally every  Euclidean space Rn -can be regarded as one-dimensional. Let k  denote a Peano curve which covers R2 (this implies that k is the image  of a continuous mapping of R onto R 2).14 Let P denote the origin of k  (i.e. the image of 0 under the said mapping). Then every point Q in R2  is unambiguously determined by the arc (or arcs) of k joining Q to P,  hence by a relation of Q to a single position in R2.  The insufficiency of Russell's axioms for supporting the full weight  of projective geometry was pointed out by Henri Poincare in a critical  article about Russell's book (Poincare, 1899). Russell replied in his  essay "Sur les axiomes de la geometrie" (1899). He acknowledged  that Poincare was right on this point and proposed a new set of six  axioms. These are stated with great precision. Letters are used  instead of familiar words for designating the undefined concepts of </p><div id="pagenum"><p>the system. Russell's six axioms are axioms of incidence. Since no </p></div><div id="pagenum"><p>EMPIRICISM, APRIORISM, CONVENTION ALISM 307 </p></div><p id="page">axioms of order are given, the new system is again insufficient to  derive the theorems of projective geometry. But it is designed in  accordance with the modern idea of a deductive theory, as developed  by Pasch and the Italian school. (This shows, by the way, that Russell  did not have to wait, as some suggest, until the Parisian philosophical  congress of 1900 in order to learn about this conception -or to  develop it on his own.) Russell makes no attempt to prove that his  new axioms state necessary properties of every form of externality,  But then, as he declares at the beginning of his reply to Poincare, he  had changed his mind on several matters after the publication of his  book (Russell (1899), p.684).  4.3.3 Metrics and Quantity  Russell defines metrical geometry as "the science which deals with  the comparison and relations of spatial magnitudes",15 Russell does  not define magnitude but apparently he regards this concept as one of  those basic familiar notions which everybody understands without  further explanation. He usually treats it as synonymous with quantity.  It is far from obvious that magnitudes must be found in every form of  externality or that any such form must possess quantitative properties  or relations. Russell however makes no attempt to prove this. He  merely asserts that metrical geometry, as conceived by him, is true of  space "if quantity is to be applied to space at all" ,16 Russell tries to  show that the axioms of metrical geometry state the necessary  conditions under which, alone, quantity is applicable to a form of  externality. If Russell's arguments are conclusive, these axioms will  have been shown to be necessary, though not in an absolute sense,  but only relatively to a space where magnitudes exist and the concept  of quantity is applicable. They would then express the a priori  requirements of a definite kind of experience, namely, experience  based on spatial measurements. Russell's claims are more ambitious.  According to him, each of the axioms of metrical geometry states a  necessary property of any form of externality. But the arguments put  forth to substantiate this claim in the case of two of the axioms are  plausible only if we restrict their scope in the manner described  above. The arguments purport to prove that those two axioms­ namely, the axiom of free mobility and the axiom of distance -are  implied by the possibility of spatial measurement, not that such </p><div id="pagenum"><p>measurement must always be possible. </p></div><div id="pagenum"><p>308 CHAPTER 4 </p></div><p id="page">We have seen that, according to Russell, projective geometry deals  with "the properties common to all spaces".17lts axioms are "a priori  deductions from the fact that we can experience externality, i.e. a  coexistent multiplicity of different but interrelated things".18 We might  therefore expect that Russell will introduce metrical geometry after  the manner of Cayley and Klein, through the definition of a distance  function on point-pairs in projective space. Cayley-Klein projective  metrics do indeed bestow some plausibility on Russell's thesis that a  priori metrical geometry is the general theory of n-dimensional spaces  of constant curvature k (a theory we have designated above by  GMG), but that the actual values of nand k in physical space must be  ascertained empirically. It is not unlikely that Russell himself consi­ dered the possibility of justifying metrical geometry in this manner,  but he rejects it in his book. Cayley-Klein metrics are based on an  assignment of numerical coordinates to the points of projective space  which, Russell claims, is quite foreign to the proper use of coor­ dinates in a quantitative science of space. The coordinates assigned  by the von Staudt-Klein procedure (Section 2.3.9), says Russell, "are  not coordinates in the ordinary metrical sense, i.e. the numerical  measures of certain spatial magnitudes. On the contrary, they are a  set of numbers, arbitrarily but systematically assigned to different  points, like the numbers of houses in a street, and serving only [ ... J  as convenient designations for points which the investigation wishes  to distinguish. ,,19 In fact, the von Staudt-Klein coordinatization in­ volves more than a mere labelling of points, since it presupposes (or  induces) a topological structure in projective n-space which agrees  locally with that of R". Nevertheless, Russell is quite right in main­ taining that the coordinates assigned to any given point P do not have  a quantitative meaning, insofar as they do not in any way depend on  the actual distance between P and another point. This is indeed a  truism, since no distance function has been defined on projective  space. But I fail to see why this fact should prevent us from  introducing one or more such functions, as Klein did, via the  von Staudt-Klein coordinate functions. This leads, of course, as  Russell rightly observes, to a conventionalist conception of metric  geometry: the distance between two points in space is made to  depend on the arbitrary choice of a distance function. Russell rejects  it because he assumes that distance is a metaphysical relationship </p><div id="pagenum"><p>between points, which the distance function merely expresses. Klein </p></div><div id="pagenum"><p>EMPIRICISM, APRIORISM, CONVENTION ALISM 309 </p></div><p id="page">defined the distance between two arbitrary points P, Q in a projective  space in terms of the cross-ratio between P, Q and two fixed points  on the straight line through P and Q. But, Russell objects, "before we  can distinguish the two fixed points [ ... J from which the projective  definition [of distanceJ starts, we must already suppose some relation  between any two points on our line, in which they are independent of  other points; and this relation is distance in the ordinary sense". 20 In  another passage, Russell describes distance as "a spatial quantity [ ... J  completely determined by two points".2! The relation between two  points mentioned in the former text consists in the fact that they  determine this particular spatial quantity. The distance function  assigns to the two points a number which, so to speak, measures that  quantity. The notion of a spatial quantity determined by a point-pair  independently of every other point is obscure indeed; but we may  reasonably expect that, if the point-pair belongs to a projective space,  the real-valued function which expresses that quantity will be a  two-point projective invariant. We know, however, that there are no  two-point projective invariants. 22 Consequently, Russell's claim that  every point-pair in space has a relation in which they are independent  of other points and which consists in determining a quantity measured  by a real-valued function, openly clashes with his assertion that every  form of externality is a projective space.23 Russell will argue that the  quantitative study of a form of externality presupposes the existence  of distance. If this is right, it means simply that the purely projective  structure of a form of externality F must be enriched with a metric  structure before such a quantitative study can begin. This is done, as  we know, by defining a suitable real-valued function on F x F. In this  way, we obtain a metric space F', which is no longer the same as F. This  consequence is unavoidable, if F is originally given as a projective  space.  4.3.4 The Axiom of Distance  The general system of metric geometry proposed by Russell (GMG)  depends, he says, on three axioms: the axiom of free mobility, the  axiom of dimensions and the axiom of distance. The axiom of  dimensions is essentially the same as Projective Axiom III:  If Geometry is to be possible, it must happen that, after enough relations have been  gi ven to determine a point uniquely, its relations to any fresh known point are </p><div id="pagenum"><p>deducible from the relations already given. Hence we obtain as an a priori condition of </p></div><div id="pagenum"><p>310 CHAPTER 4 </p></div><p id="page">Geometry, logically indispensable to its existence, the axiom that Space must have a  finite integral number of Dimensions. For every relation required in the definition of a  point constitutes a dimension, and a fraction of a relation is meaningless. The number  of relations required must be finite, since an infinite number of dimensions would be  practically impossible to determine.24  But the number of dimensions of real space is a contingent matter  which must be empirically determined. It is not liable however "to the  inaccuracy and uncertainty which usually belong to empirical know­ ledge. For the alternatives which logic leaves to sense are discrete  [ ... J so that small errors are out of the question".25  The axiom of distance is stated thus: "Two points must determine a  unique spatial quantity, distance". 26 No further conditions are im­ posed on this quantity, but Russell would probably have agreed that it  is adequately represented by a non-negative real number which is  equal to zero if, and only if, the two points are identical, that it does  not depend upon the order in which the two points are taken and that  it satisfies the triangle inequality (the distance determined by points P  and Q is equal to or less than the distance determined by P and R plus  the distance determined by Rand Q). Russell holds that the axiom is a  priori in a double sense: (i) it is involved in the possibility of  measurement and (ii) it is necessarily true of any possible form of  externality. This he regards as a consequence of four propositions  which he intends to prove: (1) spatial magnitude is not measurable  unless distance exists; (2) two points determine a distance only if they  determine a unique curve in space; (3) "the existence of such a curve  can be deduced from the conception of a form of externality";  (4) "the application of quantity to such a curve necessarily leads to  a certain magnitude, namely distance, uniquely determined by any two  points which determine the curve". 27 It is clear that (i) follows  immediately from (1). But (ii) does not follow from our four pro­ positions alone; we must add: (5) every form of externality invites­ or demands -the application of quantity. As we observed earlier, this  last premise is neither mentioned nor proved by Russell.  *Russell's proofs of Propositions (1)-(4) are long and inconclusive.  They are interesting chiefly as illustrations of some philosophical  prejudices. Since the original text is easily available (Russell, FG,  pp.164-175), we shall sketch them cursorily. The proof of (1) requires  an additional premise: Spatial figures can be freely moved without </p><div id="pagenum"><p>distortion. This is the axiom of free mobility, which, Russell claims, is </p></div><div id="pagenum"><p>EMPIRICISM, APRIORISM, CONVENTION ALISM 311 </p></div><p id="page">presupposed in all spatial measurement (we shall deal with It In  Section 4.3.5). It seems to me, however, that this axiom makes no  sense unless we take distance for granted, since distortion means  precisely a change in the distances between the points of a figure. It is  surprising, therefore, that Russell should use this axiom to prove that  distances exist. He argues more or less as follows: Two points must  have some relation to each other, for such relations alone constitute  position. It follows from the axiom of free mobility that two points,  forming a figure congruent with the given pair, can be constructed in  any part of space. Consequently, the relation between the two point­ pairs is "quantitatively the same [ ... ] since congruence is the test of  spatial equality. Hence the two points have a quantitative relation"  which is not altered by motion. This implies that the relation depends  on the two points alone, because if it also depended on a third point,  there would be some motion of the first two points which would alter  it. "Hence the relation between the two points [ ... ] must be an  intrinsic relation, a relation involving no other point or figure in space;  and this relation we call distance." (Russell, FG, p.165). The italicized  passage marks the point where Russell openly begs the question,  immediately after invoking the axiom of free mobility: it is assumed  that the relation between the two point-pairs can be judged from a  quantitative point of view. Russell asks: why should not there be  more than one such intrinsic quantitative relation between two points?  His reply is fantastic: "A point is defined by its relations to other  points, and when once the relations necessary for definition have  been given, no fresh relations to the points used in definition are  possible, since the point defined has no qualities from which such  relations could flow." (Russell, FG, p.166). If relations between points  must flow from their qualities, one must ask for the qualities of the as  yet undefined points whence the relations defining them are supposed  to flow.  *The proof of (2) runs thus: "Some curve joining the two points is  involved in the above notion of a combined motion of the two points,  or of two other points forming a figure congruent with the first two.  For without some such curve, the two point-pairs cannot be known as  congruent, nor can we have any test by which to discover when a  point-pair is moving as a single figure. Distance must be measured,  therefore, by some line which joins the two points." (Russell, FG, </p><div id="pagenum"><p>p.166f.). This line must be determined by the two points alone, </p></div><div id="pagenum"><p>312 CHAPTER 4 </p></div><p id="page">because if it depended on still another point, distance would not be a  quantity completely determined by two points. I confess that  Russell's reasoning bewilders me. Why should the curve used for  testing that a pair of points moves as a single figure actually measure  the distance between them? How does such a test work? Russell  apparently believes that we can claim that two point-pairs (P, Q), (P',  Q') are congruent only if a particular arc k uniquely determined by P  and Q is congruent with the arc k' uniquely determined by P' and Q'.  It seems clear, however, that in order to establish the congruence  between k and k' we must first bring P and Q into coincidence with P'  and Q'. Thus the congruence between point-pairs is presupposed by  the test of the congruence between arcs.  *The proof of (3) presupposes that the axiom of free mobility is true  of every conceivable form of externality (see Note 36). This implies  that (1) is true of every such form as well. (3) is then inferred as  follows: "Since our form [of externality] is merely a complex of  relations, a relation of externality must appear in the form, with the  same evidence as anything else in the form; thus if the form be  intuitive or sensational, the relation must be immediately presented,  and not a mere inference. Hence, the intrinsic relation between two  points must be a unique figure in our form, i.e. in spatial terms, the  straight line joining the two points". (Russell, FG, p.I72). The last  step clearly implies that, in Russell's opinion, a point-pair, as such, is  not a figure in space (in order to make a figure we must draw a line  joining the points). Now, if a point-pair is not a figure, the axiom of  free mobility does not apply to it, and Russell's proof of (1) breaks  down. Hence, we would not be entitled to assert the "intrinsic relation  between two points" which is presupposed by the present argument.  *(4) asserts that the application of quantity to a curve uniquely  determined by two points leads to a magnitude, namely distance,  uniquely determined by those two points. Through (3) and (4), we can  tie the axiom of distance to the possibility of a quantitatively deter­ mined form of externality. Since the same can also be done through  (1), we have that (3) and (4) are superfluous unless they offer a  genuine alternative to (1). But both (3) and (4) are inferred from the  existence of the "intrinsic relation" between point-pairs of which (1)  is an immediate consequence. (4) is proved as follows: two arbitrary </p><div id="pagenum"><p>points P, Q have a unique intrinsic relation (by the proof of (1»; P </p></div><div id="pagenum"><p>EMPIRICISM, APRIORISM, CONVENTIONALISM 313 </p></div><p id="page">and Q determine a unique line that joins them «2»; all points in this  line are qualitatively equal; but "if one point be kept fixed, while the  other moves, there is obviously some change of relation"; such  change must be a change of quantity. "If two points, therefore,  determine a unique figure, there must exist, for the distinction be­ tween the various other points of this figure, a unique quantitative  relation between the two determining points. [ ... ] This relation is  distance." (Russell, FG, p.l72). We find again the childish notion that  a figure determined by two points cannot consist of those two points  alone, but must be a line through them. It is clear that the moving  point must move along this line, otherwise its motion would introduce  a qualitative difference between it and the other points on the line  (namely, that it no longer belongs to the line). But if all points on the  line are qualitatively equal the motion of one of them along the line  cannot be defined, unless we presuppose some non-qualitative  difference between them. In Russell's terminology, whatever is non­ qualitative is quantitative. The argument therefore begs the question:  unless we assume that the two points which determine the line sustain  a unique quantitative relation, we cannot make any sense of the  motion of one of these points against a fixed background of other  points which are qualitatively equal to it.  *1 wish to discuss finally Russell's assertion that all the points of the  unique curve determined by P and Q are qualitatively equal. Until  now, we have understood that this curve is an arc from P to Q. On  this arc, P and Q, being the extremes, differ qualitatively from the  points which lie between them. But Russell assumes here a different  interpretation: the curve determined by P and Q is the straight line  through these points. This interpretation agrees with Projective  Axiom III, which says that two points determine a straight line.  Russell consistently identifies qualitative properties and relations in  space with projective properties and relations. The relation between P  and Q is projectively equivalent to the relation between P and any  other point R on the straight line PQ. Hence, according to Russell, Q  and R are qualitatively equal (at least as far as their relation to P is  concerned). On Russell's assumptions, the argument is sound. But if  the unique curve determined by P and Q is the (full) straight line PQ,  we cannot claim that the length of this curve measures the distance </p><div id="pagenum"><p>between P and Q (as Russell concluded in the proof of (2». </p></div><div id="pagenum"><p>314 CHAPTER 4 </p></div><p id="page">4.3.5 The Axiom of Free Mobility  The mainstay of Russell's theory of metric geometry is the axiom of  free mobility. He states it thus:  Spatial magnitudes can be moved from place to place without distortion; or, as it may  be put, Shapes do not in any way depend upon absolute position in space.'·  A similar principle had been placed at the foundation of geometry by  Ueberweg (Section 4.1.2) and by Helmholtz (Section 3.1.1). These  authors assumed a space in which the distance between points was  defined, and tried to ascertain the conditions which such a space must  fulfil in order to satisfy the principle of free mobility. Helmholtz  concluded that, if the space is a differentiable manifold, it must be an  R-manifold of constant curvature. Russell, on the other hand, uses  the axiom of free mobility for proving that a point-pair must deter­ mine a distance. This might make sense if we deal with a physical  space, populated by material bodies, and there happens to exist a  non-geometrical test of the deforming forces which act on bodies, i.e.  a method for ascertaining the presence or absence of such forces  without measuring geometrical magnitudes (volumes, distances).  Then, if a body B, which fills a region R, is moved in the absence of  deforming forces to a region R' we may conclude that R' is congruent  with R. In particular, if two marks M, N on B, which originally lie  upon the points P, Q on R, are carried over to points P', Q' on R', we  shall say that (P, Q) and (P', Q') are equidistant and we shall require  that any distance function which we might wish to define will agree  with this fact. We thereby treat geometry as inseparable from phy­ sics, and as founded upon physical facts. Such was the main tenet of  Helmholtz's empiricist philosophy of geometry (Section 3.1.3).  Russell criticizes it vigorously. "But for the independent possibility of  measuring spatial magnitudes, none of the magnitudes of Dynamics  could be measured. Time, force, and mass are alike measured by  spatial correlates: these correlates are given, for time, by the first law  [of Newtonian mechanics]; for force and mass, by the second and  third [ ... J. Geometry, therefore, must already exist before Dynamics  becomes possible: to make Geometry dependent for its possibility on  the laws of motion or any of its consequences is a gross hysteron  proteron. ,,29 Nevertheless, Russell does not conceive geometrical </p><div id="pagenum"><p>motion, after the fashion of pure IT'athematics, merely as a space </p></div><div id="pagenum"><p>EMPIRICISM, APRIORISM, CONVENTIONALISM 315 </p></div><p id="page">transformation subject to certain conditions. Such a conception  presupposes indeed a metric function, which motions are required to  preserve. Russell regards motion as actual transport of matter. For  geometry, however, matter is "merely kinematical matter", matter  deprived in thought of all its dynamical properties. Such matter,  Russell maintains, is a priori rigid, because, being "devoid, ex hypo­ thesi, of causal properties, there remains nothing, in mere empty  space, which is capable of changing the configuration of any  geometrical system ".30 This "geometrical rigidity", which is fully  sufficient for the theory of geometry, "means only that a shape, which  is possible in one part of space, is possible in any other" .31 Let us  consider more carefully what sameness of shape can mean under the  conditions (or rather, the absence of conditions) assumed by Russell.  Let M denote a lump of "kinematical matter", which fills a region R in  space S. A movement f takes M to a different region R'. I imagine  that Russell would have expected f to represent some sort of  continuous process. That makes sense only if S is a topological space.  If R is a connected subspace of S, R' is also a connected subspace.  More generally, we may require Rand R' to have homeomorphic  interiors. I do not think that on Russell's assumptions we can impose  any further restrictions on R'. Indeed, since both matter and space are  entirely devoid of causal properties, any continuous process which  carries M from one region of S to another takes place in the absence  of deforming forces and may therefore claim the status of a rigid  motion. In other words, on the stated assumptions, sameness of shape  is tantamount to topological equivalence. We could hardly have  expected a different outcome, since S is not defined ab initio as a  metric space and M is not subject to non-geometrically testable  shape-preserving forces (which could have been used for introducing  a metric a posteriori). In fact, if M is held together during the  movement f it is due only to the postulated continuity of f, for  kinematical matter does not by itself possess any dynamical proper­ ties to prevent M from flying apart. Russell's "kinematical bodies" are  thus seen to be mere abstract sets, endowed with such structure as  they can pick from the previously defined space in which they are  placed.32  We need not dwell long on Russell's proof that the axiom of free  mobility states a prerequisite of spatial measurement, since we have </p><div id="pagenum"><p>already seen this point argued by Helmholtz (Section 3.1.1). Russell </p></div><div id="pagenum"><p>316 CHAPTER 4 </p></div><p id="page">gives a "philosophical" and a "geometrical" argument. According to the  former, a figure will change its shape as a result of motion only if  space itself exercises a definite action upon it. But this is absurd,  since space is passive. "Space must, since it is a form of externality,  allow only of relative, not of absolute position, and must be  completely homogeneous throughout.,,33 The "geometrical" argument  is given as a refutation of the possibility, claimed by Benno Erdmann,  of constructing a geometry in which sizes vary with motion according  to a definite law. 34 Russell understands that in such geometry "the  fundamental proposition that two magnitudes which can be super­ posed in one position can be superposed in any other, stilI holds" .35 In  other words, he fails to see that if the magnitudes change size with  motion and are transported along different routes they might no  longer coincide when they meet for a second time. The refutation of  Erdmann proceeds as follows:  A judgment of magnitude is essentially a judgment of comparison [ ... J. To speak of  differences of magnitude, therefore, in a case where comparison cannot reveal them, is  logically absurd. Now in the case contemplated above, two magnitudes, which appear  equal in one position, appear equal also when compared in another position. There is no  sense, therefore, in supposing the two magnitudes unequal when separated, nor in  supposing, consequently, that they have changed their magnitudes in motion [ ... J. Since,  then, there is no means of comparing two spatial figures, as regards magnitude, except  superposition, the only logically possible axiom, if spatial magnitude is to be self­ consistent, is the axiom of Free Mobility.J6  The argument is powerless, since, as we remarked above, it rests on a  false assumption. Its interest is mainly historical: it involves an early  version of the notorious verifiability criterion of meaning.  Russell's insistence in shape preservation and the homogeneity of  space suggested an interesting objection to Louis Couturat. Russell's  space is merely isogeneous, not fully homogeneous in Delboeuf's  sense (p.299). But, says Couturat, most of Russell's arguments for the  isogeneity of space could also be made for its homogeneity. Accord­ ing to Russell, space is relative, passive, indifferent to figures and  bodies placed in it. But  these three characters seem to imply homogeneity and not only isogeneity. Can you say  that space is a pure, empty form, indifferent to its content, unless you can construct in  it two similar figures of different size? [ ... J Can you maintain that it is the amorphous,  passive receptacle of every possible figure if you can neither construct the same figure  on diverse scales, nor enlarge it without deforming it, as if space reacted upon it in the </p><div id="pagenum"><p>manner of a rigid form?J1 </p></div><div id="pagenum"><p>EMPIRICISM, APRIORISM, CONVENTIONALISM 317 </p></div><p id="page">Couturat concludes that Russell's arguments do not merely establish  the a priori truth of GMG, but of n-dimensional Euclidean geometry  as well. Russell replies with an argument which we have already met  (p.297):  Those who assert that it is a priori evident that the sides of a triangle can be increased  in a given proportion without changing the angles, should also claim [ ... J that it is  equally possible to change all the angles in a fixed proportion without changing the  sides. But this is, as we know, impossible in all geometries. If we admit the logically  relative nature of every magnitude, I cannot see why the argument should apply only to  linear dimensions and not to angles which are magnitudes as well. 38  A stronger objection was made by Lechalas (1898). He believes  that the axiom of free mobility, as understood by Russell (and by  Helmholtz) is unnecessarily strong. To set up a metrical geometry, it  should suffice to assume (with Riemann) that the length of an arc is  preserved during displacement. Indeed, if the free mobility of n­ dimensional figures were a necessary condition of n-dimensional  metric geometry, we could not study the intrinsic geometry of an  arbitrary surface, as taught by Gauss. On such a surface, say, on the  surface of an egg, it is impossible to transport a 2-dimensional figure  undeformed. On the other hand, if we are content to postulate the  preservation of arc-length in motion, admissible geometries need not  fit into the framework of Russell's GMG, but, as in Riemann's lecture,  they may even extend beyond the much broader framework of  R-manifolds of arbitrary curvature. Russell had discussed in his book  the example of egg-geometry, but had refused to draw from it any  conclusions regarding higher-dimensional spaces. He reasons thus:  What, I may be asked, is there about a thoroughly non-congruent Geometry, more  impossible than this Geometry on the egg? The answer is obvious. The geometry of  non-congruent surfaces is only possible by the use of infinitesimals, and in the  infinitesimal all surfaces become plane. The fundamental formula, that for the length of  an infinitesimal are, is only obtained on the assumption that such an arc may be treated  as a straight line, and that Euclidean Plane Geometry may be applied in the immediate  neighbourhood of any point. If we had not our Euclidean measure, which could be  moved without distortion, we should have no method of comparing small arcs in  different places, and the Geometry of non-congruent surfaces would break down. Thus  the axiom of Free Mobility, as regards three-dimensional space, is necessarily implied  and presupposed in the Geometry of non-congruent surfaces; the possibility of the  latter, therefore, is a dependent and derivative possibility, and can form no argument </p><div id="pagenum"><p>against the a priori necessity of congruence as the test of equality.39 </p></div><div id="pagenum"><p>318 CHAPTER 4 </p></div><p id="page">This passage contains a gross misunderstanding of the fundamentals  of Gauss' and Riemann's differential geometry. In Riemann's theory  (Part 2.2), the geometry of an arbitrary n-dimensional R-manifold M  is locally approached at each point P by the geometry of the n­ dimensional Euclidean space T p(M), but this has nothing whatsoever  to do with a possible embedding of M in an (n + I)-dimensional (or, if  you wish, in an (n + k)-dimensional) Euclidean space. T p(M) is the  tangent space of M at P, which is certainly not conceived after the  intuitive analogy of a plane which touches a surface at a point and  extends into the surrounding space (Section 2.2.7). Indeed, if Russell's  argument were sound, we ought to conclude that spherical and  pseudospherical geometries can be constructed in two dimensions  because "our Euclidean measure" is available in the circumambient  Euclidean space, but that, contrary to Russell's beliefs, a three­ dimensional space of constant positive or negative curvature is im­ possible, unless there actually exists a higher-dimensional Euclidean  space in which it is imbedded. That would imply the subordination of  GMG to n-dimensional Euclidean geometry which Russell rejected in  his discussion with Couturat.  4.3.6 A Geometrical Experiment  We said earlier that according to Russell the determination of the  constant curvature of physical space must be left to experience.  Couturat defied him to mention one experiment that could serve for  this purpose. Russell replied that no experiment can give the exact  value of space curvature, but that the following, very simple pro­ cedure, can fix an upper and a lower bound to that value: Take a  circular disc, e.g. a coin; make a mark on its edge; let it run along a  geodetic arc in space until the mark makes a full revolution; we can  thus determine the ratio of the circumference to the diameter of a  circle and compute from it the value of the space curvature.40 This  experiment presupposes that we can recognize a circular disc and a  geodetic arc and that we can determine the length of the latter.  Russell is apparently sure that the experiment will show that we live  in an approximately Euclidean space. But he emphasizes a fact we  have repeatedly suggested in this book: "The image we actually have  of space is not sufficiently accurate to exclude, in the actual space we  know, all possibility of a slight departure from the Euclidean type".41 </p><div id="pagenum"><p>Indeed, if this were not so, Euclid's fifth postulate would have </p></div><div id="pagenum"><p>EMPIRICISM, APRIORISM, CONVENTION ALISM 319 </p></div><p id="page">appeared obvious from the outset and probably nobody would have  chanced upon the idea of developing a non-Euclidean geometry.  4.3.7 Multidimensional Series  Soon after the publication of the Foundations of Geometry, Russell  took a very different approach to the problems of space and  geometry, based on the analysis of the "logical" ideas of series and  order. The new approach is briefly sketched toward the end of  Russell's reply to Poincare,42 it provides the main support for the  criticism of the relationist theories of time and space which he read at  the Paris Congress of Philosophy in 1900,43 and it determines the  treatment of geometry in his great book, The Principles of Mathema­ tics (1903). In Russell's usage, the idea of order covers both linear  and cyclical order.44 According to him, order can only arise in a set  with more than two elements. Order is generated in a set S if a  transitive antisymmetric binary relation is defined in S so that, for any  three distinct elements, XIo X2, X3 E S, there is always a permutation (T  of {l, 2, 3} such that X<T(I) stands in the said relation to X<T(2) and X<T(2)  stands in it to X<T(3)' A self-sufficient simple series is an ordered set.  Russell speaks also of a simple series by correlation, which is a set  indexed by an ordered set, or, as we would rather say, the graph of a  mapping of an ordered set onto an arbitrary set. A self-sufficient  simple series is also described as "a series of one dimension". The  ordered elements of such a series are called terms. A series of two  dimensions is a series of one dimension whose terms are series of one  dimension. Generally, a series of (n + 1) dimensions (n ;:;;. 1) is a series  of one dimension whose terms are series of n dimensions.  Geometry -says Russell- may be considered as a pure a priori science. or as the study  of actual space. In the latter sense, I hold it to be an experimental science, to be  conducted by means of careful measurements. [ ... J As a branch of pure mathematics,  Geometry is strictly deductive, indifferent to the choice of its premisses and to the  question whether there exist (in the strict sense) such entities as its premisses define.  Many different and even inconsistent sets of premisses lead to propositions which  would be called geometrical. but all such sets have a common element. This element is  wholly summed up by the statement that Geometry deals with series of more than one  dimension."  Russell's definition of geometry as "the study of series of two or more  dimensions" is inordinately restrictive and has never been heeded by </p><div id="pagenum"><p>philosophers or mathematicians. </p></div><div id="pagenum"><p>320 CHAPTER 4 </p></div><p id="page">Russell's mature views on geometry and space, presented in Our  Knowledge of the External World (1914) and The Analysis of Matter  (1926), owe a great deal to the influence of A.N. Whitehead and fall  outside the scope of this study.  4.4 HENRI POINCARE  4.4.1 Poincare's Conventionalism  Henri Poincare (1854-1912) had an agile, keen intelligence and a  masterful command of French prose. The very ease with which novel  ideas and similes came to his mind and flowed from his pen caused  him, at times, to state his philosophical views with less care than he  deemed necessary, say, when formulating mathematical equations.  This has given rise to some misunderstandings and unfair criticisms  of his position. The core of his epistemology seems to be the  following: Science is concerned with hard facts and their relations.'  Hard facts are known through our senses and are completely in­ dependent of the scientist's will. In order to report such facts, to  reason about them and to state their common features and mutual  connections, scientists must agree on certain conventions, regarding  the manner and method of description. Some of the conventions are  older than science, and the scientist cannot help agreeing with them  as they stand. Such are the grammatical rules of the languages used in  scientific literature, French, English, German, etc. Even in this field,  however, scientists can show some initiative, e.g. by ascribing an  unambiguous technical meaning to an ordinary word, or by adhering  faithfully to a few standard constructions (this is often observed in  20th-century mathematical prose). Other descriptive conventions,  pertaining exclusively to science, lie entirely in the scientists' hands.  Thus, the choice of a definite set of generalized coordinates when  stating a problem in mechanics is not imposed by the facts of the  matter, though the nature of the problem will normally make one  choice more advisable than others. Or, to quote another, more  controversial example: in Poincare's opinion, two distant events can  be said to be simultaneous only by virtue of a freely stipulated rule.2  The main idea of Poincare's conventionalism is thus seen to be a  piece of sound common sense, and it is hard to imagine that anyone  could disagree with it. Difficulties arise however as soon as we wish </p><div id="pagenum"><p>to draw a line between the conventional and the factual ingredients in </p></div><div id="pagenum"><p>EMPIRICISM, APRIORISM, CONVENTION ALISM 321 </p></div><p id="page">scientific statements. When shall we say that two sets of sentences  differ only in their manner of putting the very same facts? When, that  they convey different, possibly incompatible items of information?  Consider first what is seemingly the simplest example: sentences in  different languages. The sentences "Das Freiburger Munster hat einen  schonen gothischen Turm" and "La catedral de Friburgo tiene una  hermosa torre gotica" plainly convey the same fact, which can also be  expressed in English as follows: "Freiburg Cathedral has a beautiful  gothic tower". But when it comes to a more complex text, such as  Thomas Mann's Zauberberg or Gracian's Criticon, we would be hard  put to find a set of English sentences capable of rendering their entire  content, with every nuance. This generally acknowledged impossi­ bility of faithfully translating literary works is not regarded as epis­ temologically significant because it is tacitly agreed that those aspects  of reality which cannot be grasped and reported equally well in every  civilized language are not a proper subject matter for science. That is  why the study of scientific discourse is normally pursued in the light  of sentences and expressions drawn from a single language, such as  English, which are regarded as standing for their equivalents in any  viable language of science. Yet the impossibility of literary translation  should make us expect analogous situations also within the limited  field of scientific discourse. Thus, it may happen that a particular  method of description is alone suited to give a satisfactory idea of a  certain kind of facts, either because no better method has ever  occurred to anyone or -why not? -because it really is the best  conceivable. In such a case, the scientist's preference for that manner  of speaking about those facts would be no less compUlsory than, say,  Shakespeare's 'choice' of the English language for writing King Lear.  Two more examples will bring out another aspect of the subject  which is often overlooked in philosophical discussions. It is generally  admitted that the measurement units employed in registering and  reporting quantitative data belong to the conventional ingredient of  science. Indeed, such units are fixed by explicit agreement in inter­ national scientific congresses and national parliaments. This should  mean, apparently, that the same data, say, the distance between two  points at a given moment, can be registered and reported in metres or  in yards. It is evidently so if both the yard and the metre are defined  as different multiples of the same wavelength. Metre and yard stand </p><div id="pagenum"><p>then to each other in a relation analogous to that between inch and </p></div><div id="pagenum"><p>322 CHAPTER 4 </p></div><p id="page">foot: they are different derived units of the same metrical system. A  length stated in terms of one of them can be exactly expressed in  terms of the other just by multiplying it by a rational factor. Such is  not the case however if the yard is defined as the length of a metal  rod kept at some governmental institute, while the metre is given its  present official definition as so many wavelengths.3 The conversion  factor cannot then be expressed exactly. Moreover, it cannot be  determined to any desired degree of approximation, because there  are practical limits to the accuracy with which a wavelength can be  measured with a metal rod or vice versa. Since most lengths are  measured less accurately, you can indifferently use one or the other  unit to report them; to express, say, the height of a child, or the  distance flown by a plane from Heathrow to Kennedy. Measurements  based on an optical standard can attain, however, a greater precision  than those based on a rigid standard. As a consequence of this,  quantitative data which can be registered with instruments calibrated by  an optical standard cannot be registered with the same degree of  exactness with instruments calibrated by a rigid bar. Increase in  accuracy was indeed one of the reasons why the scientific community  discarded the original geodesic metre in 1889, adopting instead the  platinum-iridium standard kept at BreteuiI, and in 1960 replaced the  latter by today's optical metre. The newer unit was, in each case, defined  so as to make it equal to its immediate predecessor within the latter's  range of accuracy. But its introduction opened up the possibility of  registering and reporting quantitative data which were, so to speak,  beyond the pale of the system of measurement based on the earlier  unit.  We turn now to our second example. Think of the theories of  gravitation propounded by Newton in 1689 and by Einstein in 1915.  All scientists and most philosophers will grant that the choice be­ tween them is not merely a matter of convention. Though these two  conceptually very different theories agree within the bounds of  experimental error in nearly all their predictions, there are some cases  in which their discrepancy can be experimentally controlled. Thus,  for example, while gravitation, according to Newton's theory, does  not affect the frequency of electromagnetic waves, Einstein's theory  predicts that an electromagnetic signal sent from a point P where the  gravitational potential is lower to a point Q where it is higher will be </p><div id="pagenum"><p>seen to have, upon reception at Q, a lower frequency than a signal </p></div><div id="pagenum"><p>EMPIRICISM, APRIORISM. CONVENTION ALISM 323 </p></div><p id="page">emitted under otherwise identical conditions at Q itself. This effect,  known as "gravitational red shift" , was experimentally verified by  RV. Pound and G.A. Rebka (1960) and by RV. Pound and RL.  Snider (1965), and is usually regarded as sufficient ground for prefer­ ring Einstein's theory to Newton's theory. Nevertheless, in most  applications, both theories yield practically equivalent predictions, so  that any of them can be used to calculate the evolution of the more  familiar gravitational phenomena. Newton's theory is ordinarily  adopted, because its mathematics are more manageable. (As a matter  of fact, the intractability of Einstein's field equations will, in some  cases, make it not just advisable, but even imperative to employ the  Newtonian framework in actual calculations.)  Though our first example concerned the choice between two freely  instituted standards of measurement, while the second refers to the  choice between two physical theories which purportedly describe the  factual texture of phenomena, they show a striking analogy. Within a  specifiable range of experimental accuracy, the choice is in either  case epistemically indifferent and can be based on expediency.  Outside that range, one of the proposed alternatives must be prefer­ red for purely epistemic reasons.  The presence and significance of conventional elements in human  knowledge was emphasized in the 17th century by Thomas Hobbes,  but most philosophers took little or no notice of it. Attention was  again devoted to this issue in the last thirty years of the 19th century,  in connection with the problem of the definition and identification of  inertial systems in mechanics. This problem was raised by Carl  Neumann (1870) and was brilliantly dealt with by Ludwig Lange  (1885). Newton conceived true motion as a change of position in  absolute space. An object can appear to move and yet be truly at rest,  if, say, it constantly changes its position in the relative space deter­ mined by the walls and the ceiling of our room, but stays fixed in  absolute space. However, Newton's laws of motion imply that "the  motions of bodies included in a given space are the same among  themselves, whether that space is at rest, or moves uniformly for­ wards in a right line without circular motion". (Corollary V to the  Laws of Motion). This conclusion puts an end to any hope one might  have entertained of determining which bodies really move and which  are at rest, through the observation of bodily motions. For absolute </p><div id="pagenum"><p>space itself is not directly observable. Moreover, since it is </p></div><div id="pagenum"><p>324 CHAPTER 4 </p></div><p id="page">supposedly infinite and homogeneous, it is not easy to attach a  definite meaning to the idea of keeping or changing places in it. The  truly important thing, for the interpretation and application of  Newtonian mechanics is to identify the class of relative spaces  moving "uniformly forwards in a right line without circular motion"  with respect to one another, which are mentioned in Corollary V. A  relative space is determined by a system of bodies mutually at rest.  The systems which determine the relative spaces of Corollary V are  known as inertial systems. We can pick any inertial system and  postulate that it is at rest, without prejudice to Newton's laws or to  the predictions derived from them. On the other hand, if we have  identified an inertial system, we can easily deduce the others: they are  all those systems which are at rest or move uniformly in a straight  line and without rotation relative to it. 19th-century astronomers  knew how to construct systems of stars which can fill the role of an  inertial system to an excellent approximation. But on the strength of  Newton's gravitational theory, no particular collection of bodies can  actually behave exactly as an inertial system. Carl Neumann pro­ posed therefore to postulate a fictitious "alpha body", relative to  which any free particle (that is, any body of insignificant size upon  which no external forces are acting) is either at rest or moves in a  straight line, traversing equal distances in equal times. The time scale  involved in the characterization of the alpha body was introduced by  Neumann through an ostensibly conventional definition: two times are  equal if a free particle traverses in them equal distances.4 Such equal  distances must of course be measured with respect to an inertial  system, so that Neumann's construction appears to be circular. But  Neumann's definition of the inertial time scale inspired Ludwig Lange  with his own purely conventional characterization of an inertial  system:  An inertial system is any coordinate system in which three free particles projected  non-collinearly from a given point will have straight-line motion.l  Neumann's definition of equal times comes in quite naturally after  this. The physical contents of Newton's law of inertia is expressed in  Lange's two "theorems":  (I) Relative to an inertial system [determined by three freely moving particles] any </p><div id="pagenum"><p>additional free particle also moves in a straight. line. </p></div><div id="pagenum"><p>EMPIRICISM, APRIORISM, CONVENTION ALISM 325 </p></div><p id="page">(II) Relative to an inertial time scale [determined by one freely moving particle]  every other free particle traverses in any inertial system equal distances in equal times."  According to Lange, this rendering of Newton's first law has a  twofold advantage: it makes us aware of the "partial convention"  involved in it, and it shows at once that there are infinitely many  different inertial systems (not mutually at rest).  It is clear that Lange and other like-minded critics of Newton  would not have thought it necessary to include such conventions  among the principles of mechanics if positions in absolute space  could somehow be perceived. On the other hand, Lange's solution  obviously assumes that, at least in principle, one can always tell a  straight spatial trajectory from a curved one. Poincare was acutely  aware of the impossibility of observing absolute spatial positions and  motions and of its importance for the methodology of science. His  repeated reminders of this impossibility have probably done more for  the eventual development of relativistic mechanics than his direct  contribution to the study of the Lorentz group and its application to  physics. The total irrelevance of absolute space to scientific obser­ vation and experiment led him early to a most radical conclusion:  experience cannot teach us anything about the true structure of  space; consequently, the choice of a geometry for the description of  physical phenomena is a purely conventional matter. This implies, of  course, that a given spatial trajectory will be regarded as straight or  not depending on our free selection of a geometry. Indeed, if all of  geometry, and not just its metrical aspect, is conventional, even our  judgment that a given collection of points can be construed as a  possible trajectory depends on our previous conventions; a trajectory  must be the range of a continuous mapping of a real interval into  space, and the continuity of such a mapping depends on the topology  of space.  4.4.2 Max Black's Interpretation of Poincare's Philosophy of  Geometry  Poincare's conventionalist philosophy of geometry has not been  understood by everybody in the same way.7 Before explaining my  own view of it, it will be useful to take a look at an interpretation  proposed by Max Black in 1942. He claimed that there are two sides </p><div id="pagenum"><p>to Poincare's doctrine, that concern pure and applied geometry, </p></div><div id="pagenum"><p>326 CHAPTER 4 </p></div><p id="page">respectively. Pure geometry consists of a collection of formal  axiomatic theories.8 Applied geometry arises when one of these  theories is given a purportedly physical interpretation. The con­ ventionality of applied geometry follows from that of pure geometry.  Pure geometry is conventional because every axiomatic theory is  translatable into its contrary.9 To see what this means, let us consider  an axiomatic theory T, which is expressed in m-English.1O Let T be  determined by a set A of independent axioms. Let A' denote the set  obtained by replacing one of the sentences of A by its negation. The  theory T' determined by A' is said to be contrary to T. T is translat­ able into T' if all the undefined interpretable words of T can be  defined in T', so that upon replacing the interpretable words of any  provable sentence of T by the expression which defines them in T'  one obtains a provable sentence of T'. 11  Even if all the theories of pure geometry were actually translatable  into any of their contraries, it would hardly make sense to say that  pure geometry is conventional.l2 We say that an intellectual discipline  is conventional when statements are adopted or rejected in it for  reasons other than their (presumed) truth or falsity. But in pure  geometry no such decisions are made. Each axiomatic theory coexists  with its contraries and does not stand in their way. They all enjoy  equal epistemic rights, but there is no need to choose between them,  except insofar as we might wish at a given moment to study or to  teach one of them and not the others - a choice which evidently does  not involve a dismissal of the latter, but only their temporary neglect  by one or more men. On the other hand, if each axiomatic theory is  translatable into any of its contraries, applied geometry and, generally  speaking, applied mathematics are obviously conventional. If one  such theory T provides a satisfactory framework for the description  of some kind of natural phenomena P, the same phenomena can be  described just as faithfully (though perhaps more clumsily) within the  framework of any other theory T' into which T can be translated. It is  merely a matter of interpreting T' so that the expressions used to  render the interpretable words of T come to mean the same as these.  One may prefer T to its contraries as an appropriate means of  describing P because it is more beautiful or because it is easier to  work with it, but not because the description provided by it is truer.  However, if a given theory T, which suitably describes phenomena P, </p><div id="pagenum"><p>can only be translated into some of its contraries, but not into all of </p></div><div id="pagenum"><p>EMPIRICISM, APRIORISM, CONVENTIONALISM 327 </p></div><p id="page">them, we are faced with a quite different situation and we can no  longer maintain that applied mathematics and geometry are con­ ventional. Let a, b, c, .. denote the independent axioms of a theory T  which can only be translated into one of its contraries, say, that which  results from replacing a by its negation la. The choice between T  and T' will then be a matter of convention, as before, but the choice  between T -{a} and its several contraries can still be a matter of truth  and error. (I denote by T -{a} the theory determined by the remain­ ing axioms of T). If T is well-corroborated by experience, we ought to  conclude that the contraries of T-{a} are downright false. If T-{a}  is a geometrical theory, we cannot say that applied geometry is  conventional; not, at any rate, for the reason given by Black.  There is a particularly apposite example of a geometrical theory  which is not translatable into all its contraries. Plane BL geometry is  contrary, in Black's sense, to plane Euclidean geometry. Now, plane  BL geometry can be obtained, in the manner sketched in p.247f., by  adding a few axioms and definitions, but no new primitive terms, to  lattice theory. On the other hand, plane Euclidean geometry cannot  be obtained in this way, without introducing a new primitive term.l3  Consequently, plane Euclidean geometry is not translatable into plane  BL geometry. The same is true, for similar reasons, of BL and  Euclidean space geometries.  Our counterexample suffices to refute Black's version of geometri­ cal conventionalism, but it does not dispose of it as a reading of  Poincare. The following considerations, however, should make it  implausible. In the first place, Poincare makes no use of the dis­ tinction between pure and applied geometry when explaining his  doctrine, though it was current in contemporary French literature.  More important still: Black's approach implies that not only applied  geometry but all applied mathematics is conventional, so that any  theory in mathematical physics can be replaced by its negation, salva  veritate, provided we suitably reinterpret some of its terms. But there  is no trace in Poincare of such an extreme posture. He only contends  that the geometrical ingredient of physical theories, that is, all that  pertains specifically to the description of the spatial features of  phenomena, is not prescribed by experience, but can be chosen freely  by scientists. And his contention rests mainly on the peculiar way  how we get to know these features, and not on the semantic adap­</p><div id="pagenum"><p>tability of the theories used to describe them. </p></div><div id="pagenum"><p>328 CHAPTER 4 </p></div><p id="page">4.4.3 Poincare's Criticism of Apriorism and Empiricism  I have just spoken somewhat loosely of the spatial features of  phenomena, trusting that the reader is sufficiently familiar with  ordinary English to know what I mean. But, though a mastery of  everyday language is the necessary presupposition and the starting­ point of philosophy, the philosopher cannot rest content with it. In  our particular case, at least, we must try to state more precisely what  we mean by spatial features in order to grasp and evaluate Poincare's  thesis. The following rough partial inventory will do for our prupose.  Size and distance are probably the first things to come to one's mind  when thinking about spatial features: Buckingham Palace is larger  than the White House; Selfridge's is nearer to the Wallace Collection  than Macy's is to the Frick Collection. No less conspicuous is shape:  lines are straight or curved; surfaces are flat or concave or saddlelike;  all circles, all spheres, all squares, all cubes have the same shape, etc.  There are still other, less readily mentioned, yet possibly more  fundamental spatial features of phenomena; such are betweenness,  orientation (think of a right shoe and a left shoe), continuity, dimen­ sion number (three for a body, two for a surface, one for a line), and  last but not least, the relation of spatial containment (the proverbial  skeleton is in, that is, inside the cupboard). Does Poincare's thesis  refer to all these kinds of spatial features of things and events, or only  to some of them? When he states it in its full generality he never  seems to place any restriction on its scope. Taken literally, this would  mean that these spatial features can be described just as faithfully by  any system of geometry which is sufficiently rich to encompass them  all, even though two such systems will probably differ in what they  term large or small, straight and crooked, contiguous or separate,  interior or exterior, etc. This will sound less startling if we bear in  mind that, according to Poincare, the spatial features ascribed to  physical objects by the mathematical theories of physics -which  depend on the location of those objects in what Poincare calls  "geometrical space" -are wholly foreign to the spatial features ex­ hibited by phenomena as they appear to our senses -which Poincare  collects under the name of "sensible space" or "espace represen­ tatif". And it is, of course, only to the former that the con­ ventionalist thesis is explicitly applied by him. Now, though our </p><div id="pagenum"><p>construction of geometrical space i~ suggested and even guided by </p></div><div id="pagenum"><p>EMPIRICISM, APRIORISM, CONVENTIONALISM 329 </p></div><p id="page">our actual experience of sensible space, Poincare believes that after  that construction is perfected it can be suited to describe any  experience, however different it might be from that which originally  inspired it. To make his meaning clear, he tells a story:  Beings with minds like ours, and having the same senses as we, but without previous  education, would receive from a suitably chosen external world impressions such that  they would be led to construct a geometry other than that of Euclid and to localize the  phenomena of that external world in a non-Euclidean space, or even in a space of four  dimensions. As for us, whose education has been accomplished by our actual world, if  we were suddenly transported into this new world, we should have no difficulty in  referring its phenomena to our Euclidean space. Conversely, if these beings were  transported into our environment, they would be led to relate our phenomena to  non-Euclidean space.14  Though Poincare only asserts here the interchangeability of two  geometries which differ in their metrics but might agree in their  topologies, he never denied the possibility of employing topologically  unusual geometries in mathematical physics. And he explicitly  declared that one topological property, namely, dimension number, is  conventionally stipulated, though, of course, it is suggested by  experience. 15  Before discussing Poincare's positive reasons for upholding the  conventionalist thesis, let us examine the grounds of one powerful  negative reason he adduced in support of it. In his opinion, geometri­ cal conventionalism is the only alternative which is still open, given  that apriorism and empiricism are false. His case against apriorism is  stated very briefly. If any system of geometry were true a priori, one  could not conceive a contrary, yet equally rational system (i.e. a  system which consistently denies one of the independent principles of  the former). Since this is always possible, no system of geometry can  be true a priori. This argument shows quite plainly that Poincare is  not at all concerned with what we call pure geometry. A priori  knowledge of one system of pure geometry (that is, a priori know­ ledge of the relations of logical consequence between its axioms and  its theorems) does not preclude the possibility of knowing a priori  other such systems. Poincare's argument refutes the thesis that the  actual geometrical structure of the physical world, as it is described,  say, in Euclid's system, is logically necessary. I wonder whether this </p><div id="pagenum"><p>thesis has ever been literally held by anybody. Leibniz and Hume </p></div><div id="pagenum"><p>330 CHAPTER 4 </p></div><p id="page">apparently believed in something of the sort, but they never made  their meaning altogether clear. Had they done so, they would prob­ ably have realised that their position was untenable. The discovery of  BL geometry, of course, made it obvious. Poincare's argument is  powerless, however, against Kant's brand of apriorism, which  presupposes the very fact invoked by Poincare. In Kant's philosophy,  the necessity of geometry is not an absolute, logical necessity, but is  contingent on the changeless but unfathomable constitution of the  human mind. 16 Poincare apparently misunderstood Kant when he first  argued his case against geometrical apriorism.17 But he developed  later a more adequate strategy. He denied that we have a non­ empirical yet immediate awareness of space as a universal framework  in which every object of sense perception must be located (that is to  say, in Kantian terms, he denied that we have an a priori 'intuition' of  space as a 'form of the outer sense'), and he sought to show how  space and geometry arise from the purely intellectual enterprise of  comparing sense perceptions and reflecting upon them. Towards the  end of his life, he did assert however that there exists such a thing as  a "geometrical intuition", which is the source, e.g. of Hilbert's axioms  of order and to which he, Poincare, had continually resorted in the  course of his topological researches. But such intuition is nothing but  the awareness of our faculty of constructing an n-dimensional  continuum. The decision to put n = 3 and the definition of a metric  must be based on experience. 18  The case against geometrical empiricism is argued at greater length,  in a manner which suffices, in my opinion, to turn the tables on it, as it  was advocated in the 19th century.19 Poincare's approach, on the  other hand, has certainly contributed to prepare the new, subtler  forms of empiricism which have prevailed after him. Let us mention,  first of all, two arguments of an heuristic nature, which Poincare  always states together. Geometry cannot be an empirical science  because it is not subject to revision in the light of increasing  experience. Moreover, geometry is an exact science, whereas  empirical sciences are always approximative. The first statement may  foster the idea that Poincare is really talking about pure geometry or,  perhaps, that he is utterly confused. If, as the context shows, he  speaks, in fact, about the geometrical groundwork of mechanics, the  second statement might be taken to imply that mechanics itself and, </p><div id="pagenum"><p>more generally, every theory of mathematical physics, are not a whit </p></div><div id="pagenum"><p>EMPIRICISM, APRIORISM, CONVENTIONALISM 331 </p></div><p id="page">more empirical than geometry. For are they not, considered in them­ selves, just as exact? The last remark, however, suggests an inter­ pretation of Poincare's meaning which I think will remove our doubts  regarding both statements. As we saw in Section 4.4.1, Poincare  believed, like every practising scientist, that physical theories,  notwithstanding their mathematical exactness, can be compared with  and be corroborated or refuted by the inevitably imprecise data  supplied by observation and experiment. Why did he maintain that  geometry -and that means, as I take it, applied or physical geometry­ was exempt from such condition? Because geometry must mediate,  so to speak, between theories and data. The rough facts of obser­ vation can be compared with the neat predictions of theory only if  they are described in terms akin to the latter. The geometrical  description of phenomena (strictly speaking, their kinematic, that is,  geochronometrical, description) provides the terms of comparison  required for the evaluation of physical theories. The translation of the  "Book of Nature" into "mathematical language" can be performed in  many different ways; as many as the different systems of geometry  which are rich enough for the purpose. The formulation of a scientific  theory must, of course, be adapted to suit the chosen system of  description, but its predictive contents will remain unaltered  throughout its "translations". I have not been able to find a passage in  Poincare that directly bears witness to my interpretation, but I think  that his account of the manner how "geometrical space" -which is  none other than the space of mechanics and the rest of physics -is  constructed ratifies it indirectly.2o If my interpretation is accepted, we  at once see why physical geometry must be exact and cannot be  revised in the light of experience. Insofar as geometry itself supplies  the scheme according to which the data of experience must be  displayed if they are to make any scientific sense, it is impossible that  it should ever clash with them. Some geometries are, of course, more  manageable than others, because of their own structure and because  of the peculiar features of the empirical material which we try to  bring under their sway. Poincare believed that Euclidean geometry  was unexcelled on both counts. 21  The main argument for Poincare's rejection of empiricism was  mentioned earlier (at the end of Section 4.4.1): empirical information  has no bearing whatsoever on the structure of geometrical space. Or, </p><div id="pagenum"><p>as he puts it: </p></div><div id="pagenum"><p>332 CHAPTER 4 </p></div><p id="page">Experiments only teach us the relations of bodies to one another; none of them bears  or can bear on the relations of bodies with space, or on the mutual relations of the  different parts of space.22  In La Science et l' Hypothese this remark is placed immediately after  a very interesting discussion of "the law of relativity", which  Poincare obviously regards as having a close relation to it. Poincare  proposes that we consider an isolated material system. The laws of  the phenomena taking place in this system may depend on the state of  the component bodies and their mutual relations. but "because of the  relativity and the passivity of space" they cannot depend on the  absolute position and orientation of the system. In other words. "the  state of the bodies and their mutual distances at any given moment  will depend only on the state of these same bodies and their mutual  distances at the initial moment". but not on their relations with  (absolute) space. Poincare calls this the law of relativity. This law is  ordinarily verified by experiences described according to Euclidean  geometry. The same experiences can certainly be described according  to a non-Euclidean geometry. But the non-Euclidean distances be­ tween the different bodies will not generally be the same as their  Euclidean distances. Might not our experiences. when described  according to a non-Euclidean geometry, clash with the law of rela­ tivity? Our preference for Euclidean geometry could then perhaps be  empirically grounded. after all. Poincare remarks that a strict ap­ plication of the law of relativity demands that one consider the  universe as a whole. But if our material system is the entire universe.  experience cannot say anything about its absolute position and orien­ tation in space. All that our instruments can reveal to us is the state of  the different parts of the universe and their mutual distances. The law  of relativity should therefore be stated thus:  The readings we shall be able to make on our instruments at any instant will depend  only on the readings we could have made on these same instruments at the initial  instant.23  Since this statement is independent of the geometrical interpretation  of the readings. the "law of relativity" cannot by itself enable us to  decide between Euclidean and non-Euclidean geometry.  That experience cannot teach us anything about the "mutual rela­</p><div id="pagenum"><p>tions of the several parts of space" is certainly true of absolute space </p></div><div id="pagenum"><p>EMPIRICISM. APRIORISM, CONVENTION ALISM 333 </p></div><p id="page">as it was conceived in classical mechanics. But if phenomena exhibit  nothing but the mutual relations between material bodies, it is difficult  to understand why their geometrical description should ever put them  in connection with an elusive immaterial transcendent space. Such  connection, says Poincare, is never revealed by experience. Why  then, must we make it at all? Poincare seems to aim at a different  conception of space, which he never quite succeeded in clarifying.  Suppose we regard physical geometry as a mathematical structure  whose underlying set is formed by material bodies ('particles') or  perhaps by phenomena ('events') themselves, On this view,  experience obviously reveals "the mutual relations between the  several parts of space", and Poincare's statement is trivially false. It  would seem, however, that this conception of space agrees much  better than the classical Newtonian one with his overall approach. Of  course, it is not just a matter of wishing to see things in this way; the  whole of mechanics must be consistently reformulated in accordance  with the new view before one can finally adopt it. It is not likely that  any attempt in that direction -any attempt, that is, to treat geometry  as a structure of matter and to rid physics of the spook of absolute  space -could have succeeded while physicists persisted in conceiving  space and time separately. On the other hand, disembodied absolute  space vanished as soon as it was seen that the genuine "geometrical  space", the "mathematical continuum" which underlay the exact  representation of phenomena since the beginning of mathematical  physics, was not the three-dimensional Euclidean space, but four­ dimensional space-time, the former having always been treated as a  subspace (or rather, as a class of homeomorphic subspaces) of the  latter, This insight is usually credited to Minkowski.24 Though  Poincare was well acquainted with Minkowski's work -indeed he  even anticipated some of its technical aspects -he apparently failed  to appreciate its great significance for the philosophy of geometry,25  From the new vantage point, it is quite natural and perhaps inevitable  to allow some outstanding physical processes to determine the  characteristic features of physical geometry. Thus, in Minkowski's  version of special relativity, the geodesics of the semi-Riemannian  spacetime manifold are given (in part) by the spacetime trajectories or  "world-lines" of material particles and light-rays travelling unper­ turbed by external forces. In Cartan's version of Newtonian gravita­</p><div id="pagenum"><p>tional theory, spacetime is an affine 4-manifold in which the geodesic </p></div><div id="pagenum"><p>334 CHAPTER 4 </p></div><p id="page">joining a pair of non-simultaneous points is determined by the world­ line of a small test particle faIling freely between those points. If  geodesics are fixed in this way, the details of the affine structure of  spacetime can only be settled by experience. Since geodesics are the  straightest curves of a geometry, we may say that in these theories  certain remarkable physical processes provide a standard of straight­ ness. Such standards are freely chosen, in a sense, and one can  therefore claim that the spacetime geometry determined by them is  conventional. But it can happen that, as a matter of empirical fact, the  only processes which are sufficiently regular and ubiquitous to serve  as standards are precisely those actuaIly chosen. Thus, one could  hardly define spacetime geodesics as the world-lines of amoebae,  although, as Poincare would probably have been quick to point out,  this choice cannot be objected to on principle. In this case, as in  others we have met before, the actual circumstances of life can  restrict the scientist's decisions so much that it makes little sense to  caIl them conventional.  Our last remarks have a bearing on an anti-empiricist argument  which Poincare took over from Lotze.26 We mentioned earlier that  Gauss and Lobachevsky thought that one could test Euclidean  geometry by astronomical triangulations (p.63). Poincare writes:  If Lobachevsky's geometry is true, the parallax of a very distant star will be finite; if  Riemann's is true, it will be negative. These are results which seem within the reach of  experiment, and there have been hopes that astronomical observations might enable us  to decide between the three geometries. But in astronomy 'straight line' means simply  'path of a ray of light'. If therefore negative parallaxes were found, or if it were  demonstrated that all parallaxes are superior to a certain limit, two courses would be  open to us; we might either renounce Euclidean geometry, or else modify the laws of  optics and suppose that light does not travel rigorously in a straight line.27  The sentence in italics shows that in 1891 Poincare knew very well  that physical geometry actually identifies its characteristic elements  with some reproducible physical prototypes. Had he taken  Minkowski's standpoint he would probably have concluded that there  is no viable substitute for light-rays as a prototype of (spacetime)  straightness.28  A final anti-empiricist argument, based on the alleged possibility of </p><div id="pagenum"><p>constructing bodies which "move according to the Lobachevskian </p></div><div id="pagenum"><p>EMPIRICISM. APRIORISM. CONVENTIONALISM 335 </p></div><p id="page">group" ,29 will be understood better in the context of Section 4.4.4  (p.339f.)  4.4.4 The Conventionality of Metrics  The earliest statement of Poincare's thesis on geometry referred only  to the choice between the geometries of Euclid and Lobachevsky  (one might add, perhaps, the "geometry of Riemann", i.e. the  geometry of a maximally symmetric space of constant positive  curvature). It occurs at the end of the paper on the fundamental  hypotheses of geometry (1887), which we considered in Section 3.1.6.  Although this is concerned with pure geometry, the conventionalist  thesis refers explicitly to physical geometry. The conclusion of the  article is, as we know, that the two-dimensional geometries of  constant negative, positive and null curvature can be characterized  respectively by a different group of motions. Poincare rightly takes  for granted that a similar conclusion applies to the corresponding  space geometries. Since "geometry is nothing but the study of a  group", "one might say that the truth of the geometry of Euclid is not  incompatible with the truth of the geometry of Lobachevsky, for the  existence of a group is not incompatible with that of another group".30  Among all possible groups, we have chosen one in particular. in order to refer to it all  physical phenomena, just as we choose three coordinate axes in order to refer to them  a geometrical figure. l'  The choice of this particular group is motivated in the first place by  its simplicity: in contrast with the groups characteristic of BL and  spherical geometries, the group of Euclidean motions contains a  proper normal subgroup; "translated into analytical language, this  means that there are fewer terms in the equations".32 But it is chosen  also because  there exist in nature some remarkable bodies which are called solids. and experience  tells us that the different possible movements of these bodies are related to one another  much in the same way (0 fort peu pres] as the different operations of the chosen  group.Jl  On the other hand, "the chosen group is merely more comfortable  than the others". To say that Euclidean geometry is true and BL  geometry is false makes so much sense as to say that Cartesian </p><div id="pagenum"><p>coordinates are true and polar coordinates are false. </p></div><div id="pagenum"><p>336 CHAPTER 4 </p></div><p id="page">It is perhaps no accident that in his remarks of 1887 on the status of  physical geometry, Poincare should have mentioned only the latter  two geometrical systems, though he considered several others in the  purely mathematical part of his article. The Euclidean group and the  BL group are topological groups which can be assumed to act  transitively and effectively on one and the same topological space.34  Each is indeed isomorphic with a different subgroup of the group of  continuous transformations of R3.35 Obviously, every item of in­ formation concerning figures in R3 can be conveyed in terms of the  invariants of either group (p.176). Consequently, if, as in classical  mechanics, physical space is assumed to be homeomorphic with R3,  both Euclidean and BL geometry can be used as a framework for the  geometrical description of physical phenomena. The foregoing  argument does not apply to every system of geometry. Thus, the  group of motions of spherical 3-space cannot act transitively on R3.36  Nevertheless, in subsequent discussions of the conventional status of  geometry, Poincare always treats spherical geometry ("the geometry  of Riemann") on a par with Euclidean and BL geometry. I can think  of two possible explanations of his attitude.  The first is fairly simple. The group of motions of spherical space  geometry can act transitively on the three-dimensional sphere S3. R3 is  homeomorphic with the punctured sphere (S3 minus a point). Any  physical system which is accessible to observation in its entirety will  remain, during the whole period in consideration, within some open  proper subset of physical space. If, as we have assumed, this is  homeomorphic with an open set of R3, it is also homeomorphic with  an open set of S3. We may therefore describe its contents in terms of  the invariants of the spherical group, just as we could do it in terms of  those of the other two groups. Of course, this will no longer do if one  attempts to speak about the whole physical world. One must then  face the alternative of a compact or a non-compact space, and it does  not seem likely that this can be settled by convention. 37  The second explanation which I wish to propose for Poincare's  equal treatment of the three classical geometries is more involved. It  is suggested by his discussion of the origin of Euclidean geometry.38  Poincare was one of the first mathematicians to distinguish neatly  between the abstract structure of a group -its "form", as he called  it -and its embodiments in diverse "materials". Thus, e.g. the group </p><div id="pagenum"><p>of permutations of {l, 2, 3, 4} is isomorphic with the group of </p></div><div id="pagenum"><p>EMPIRICISM, APRIORISM. CONVENTIONALISM 337 </p></div><p id="page">isometries of a regular tetrahedron (i.e. the distance preserving map­ pings of the tetrahedron onto itself) and with the groups of motions of  a cube and of a regular octahedron (i.e. the distance and orientation  preserving transformations of the cube and of the octahedron), We  may therefore regard these groups as four embodiments of the same  "form" in different "materials". For greater precision, allow me to  introduce a few new terms. Let G be a group, S a set, T s the group of  permutations of S (i.e. the set of all bijective mappings of S onto S,  with composition of mappings as group product). A realization of G  in S is an homomorphism of G into T s, that is, a mapping 'P: G ~ T s,  such that, for any g, g' E G, 'P(g)' cp(g') = cp(gg'), S is said to be the  basis of the realization cpo A realization cp of G in S is said to be  transitive if for every x, yES there is agE G such that cp(g) maps  x on y. It is said to be faithful if cp is an isomorphism of G onto cp(G).  Obviously, what Poincare calls the "material" or "matter" of a group  is the set providing the basis for a given realization of the group. We  note, in particular, that if S is a topological space and G is a  topological group which acts on S, the action <1>: G x S ~ S determines  a realization of G in S, namely, the mapping which assigns to each  g E G the permutation x ~ <p(g, x) (x E S). The realization is tran­ sitive if the action <I> is transitive; it is faithful if the action is  effective.39 Each of the classical geometries is concerned with a  faithful and transitive realization of one of the three classical groups  of motions. The basis for the realization is provided by the same  topological space in the case of Euclidean and BL geometry; by a  different space in the case of spherical geometry. This fact might  make an epistemologically significant difference between the latter  geometry and the other two if groups had to obtain their "materials"  so to speak from the outside. Our preference for the latter geometry  or for one of the former would then depend on the nature of the  available "material". Such was, as Poincare observes, the position of  his predecessors Helmholtz and Lie, who believed that "the matter of  the group existed previously to the form" and that "in geometry  the matter is a Zahlenmannigfaltigkeit of three dimensions". For  Poincare, "on the contrary, the form exists before the matter".40  Moreover, as Poincare certainly knew, any group has a realization in  itself or in a set which is given together with it (i.e. in one of the sets  that exist if the group exists). Let us call a realization for which the </p><div id="pagenum"><p>group itself directly or indirectly provides a basis, an immanent </p></div><div id="pagenum"><p>338 CHAPTER 4 </p></div><p id="page">realization of the group. On pp.350f. we shall construct an immanent  realization of the Euclidean group which is a model of Euclidean  geometry. Models of the other two classical geometries can be built  analogously. Poincare apparently thought that any of them could be  used to describe the "brute facts" of sense experience, if the latter  are suitably idealized.  * As an exercise which will be of some use to us later, I give here a  general method of constructing an immanent realization of a group.  We make first some agreements on notation and terminology. Let cp  be a realization of a group G in a set S. We agree to write cpg instead  of cp(g) for the value of cp at g E G. If xES, the set {g I g E G and  Cpg(x) = x} is a subgroup of G, called the stability group of x. If cpf is a  realization of G in a set Sf, and there is a bijective mapping f: S -+ Sf  such that, for every g E G, cp~ = f· cpg • rl, we say that cpf is similar  to cpo  *Let G be any group, H a subgroup of G. If g E G, we denote by gH  the set {x I x = gh for some h E H}; we call this set the left coset of H  by g. Let G/H be the set {gH I g E G} of all the left cosets of H. The  reader should satisfy himself that each g E G belongs to one and only  one element of G/H. We now define a mapping g t--+ fg of G into the  set of permutations of G/H. It is enough to determine the value of fg,  for any g E G, at an arbitrary point kH of G/H. We fix it as follows:  fg(kH) = gkH.  *It is not hard to see that f is a transitive realization of G in G/H.41  Since G/H is given together with G, this is indeed an immanent  realization. It can also be shown easily that H (regarded as a subgroup  of G) is the stability group of H (regarded as a point in GIH).42  Moreover, f is similar to every realization of G in which H is a  stability group. If H does not contain a proper normal subgroup of G,  f is a faithful realization of G.  The choice between Euclidean and BL geometry can be viewed as  a choice between two definitions of distance in R 3, namely, the  two-point invariant of the Euclidean group  d(x, y) = (~ (Xi -y;)2Y'2  and the corresponding two-point invariant of the BL group. Poincare  enlarged upon his ideas on the conventionality of distance in his </p><div id="pagenum"><p>article of 1891 on non-Euclidean geometries and in two polemical </p></div><div id="pagenum"><p>EMPIRICISM. APRIORISM. CONVENTIONALISM 339 </p></div><p id="page">articles of 1899 and 1900, motivated by Russell's Foundations of  Geometry. In 1891, he introduced a dictionary to translate BL  geometry into Euclidean geometry, an idea that in diverse variations  and generalizations has had great success in 20th-century episte­ mology. Since we have seen already on pp.8lf. how a dictionary of  this kind works, I shall not dwell upon this subject any longer.43 In the  article of 1900, Poincare agrees with Russell that one cannot define  everything, but he will not admit that distance is one of the notions  which you cannot or need not define. There is no such thing as a  direct intuition of distance. Moreover, Poincare will not grant that the  distance from Paris to London is greater than one metre. He readily  admits of course that any definition which would make that distance  equal to or less than one metre runs counter to common sense. For I  can encompass the standard platinum-iridium metre within my arms,  while it is impossible for me to place at the same time one hand in  London and the other in Paris. It is also so much more difficult to go  from Paris to London than to traverse the length of the standard  metre.  That is why a method of measurement which would show the distance from Paris to  London to be equal to one metre would be inadequate for all practical uses and anyone  who proposed to adopt it by convention would lack common sense. But to say that the  distance from Paris to London is greater than one metre absolutely, independently of  every method of measurement, is neither true nor false: I find that it does not mean  anything ....  A golf-ball in a golf hole is certainly smaller than the earth. But I  cannot infer from this that it will remain smaller than the earth while  it flies across the air to the next hole. To grant that the ball preserves  its volume as it moves is tantamount to making it into a measurement  instrument, thereby conventionally adopting a system of measure­ ment.  The article of 1900 develops also the anti-empiricist argument  which I mentioned at the end of Section 4.4.3 and whose discussion I  postponed. The argument purports to show that the fact that ordinary  solid bodies move approximately in accordance with the Euclidean  group (that is to say, that the Euclidean distances between their parts,  measured by the usual methods, do not change appreciably as the  bodies move), cannot tell us anything about the geometrical structure </p><div id="pagenum"><p>of physical space. We shall consider two material bodies K" K2• </p></div><div id="pagenum"><p>340 CHAPTER 4 </p></div><p id="page">K; (i = 1,2) consists of eight thin steel rods OAf. ... , OAj, OB!. OBt  permanently joined at 0; it also includes some device regulating the  relative positions of the vertices Aj, Bi as K; moves. Let P, QIo Q2 be  three points marked, say, on a piece of wood, so that Aj, Bi and 0 can  be simultaneously placed upon P, Q2 and QIo respectively (j =  1, ... ,6; k = 1,2). We assume also that the point-pairs AjAj+J (l "'" j "'"  5) and A~A; can be brought into coincidence with PQ; (i = 1,2).  Poincare asserts that K J "moves according to the Euclidean group or  at least that it does not move according to the Lobachevskian group",  while K2 "does not move according to the Euclidean group", but might  move according to the BLgroup. Now KJ can be built quite easily. K2 on  the other hand, requires some ingenuity, but, Poincare says, any  mechanic can contrive it.45 Since KJ and K2 can exist simultaneously,  their properties cannot teach us anything about the true geometry of the  world.  There is a fallacy in the foregoing argument that it will be in­ structive to expose. We must distinguish between the body K;,  consisting of eight steel rods plus a regulating device, and the particle  system formed by the eight vertices Aj, Bi (i = 1, 2; 1 "'" j "'" 6; k =  1,2). Let us denote the latter by Ki. Now it is only K2, but not K2, that  can be held to move according to the BL group. The eight particles of  K2 will preserve their BL distances because they are artfully joined  by eight or more bodies, each of which moves according to the  Euclidean group. We can imagine of course a BL polyhedron (a  double hexagonal pyramid) whose vertices are, at each moment, A1,  Bi, and we can also make plastic models of it in its several positions.  But there is no known material which, when moulded into one of  these shapes, will take of itself the whole series of them, as it is  pushed around.  4.4.5 The Genesis of Geometry  Poincare's deepest speculations on our subject are contained in his  long essay "On the foundations of geometry", published in English in  The Monist of October 1898. It is a rather ambitious attempt to show  how our idea of geometrical space -as it occurs, say, in classical  mechanics -arises with experience, though certainly not from it.  Poincare's entire construction rests upon an untenable theory of  perception, according to which all our knowledge of physical facts </p><div id="pagenum"><p>can be ultimately traced to a variegated and changing aggregate of </p></div><div id="pagenum"><p>EMPIRICISM, APRIORISM, CONVENTIONALISM 341 </p></div><p id="page">elementary sensations, each of which is caused by the momentary  stimulation of an afferent nerve. Because they rest on such foundations,  many statements in the essay are unclear or simply unlikely, which is  probably the reason why it has often been neglected in recent  discussions of Poincare's conventionalism.46 It is indeed a pity that  the great mathematician and mathematical physicist should have been  thus seduced by his philosophical colleagues into believing their  psychological fantasies; but we must put up with this fact and its  often irritating manifestations, if we wish to follow Poincare's  thought. The latter is instructive in spite of its shortcomings, because  it provided some essential ingredients and a rudimentary prototype  for other, more sophisticated, psychologically sounder inquiries into  the origin of geometry that have been pursued in the 20th century.  Due to its greater simplicity and na"ivete, Poincare's theory can throw  light on the work of his successors and aid us to understand the very  problem which they all set out to solve. In the rest of this section, I  shall outline Poincare's genetic construction step by step, without  questioning his sensationist assumptions any further. I shall, however,  bring out several points which merit criticism in Poincare's own  terms. Throughout our exposition, we must try to avoid the chief  danger involved in such investigations, namely. the premature and  surreptitious application of the very ideas of geometry and space  whose genesis is being re-enacted. Because our language is pervaded  with spatial idioms, this danger is very difficult to avoid. I am not  quite sure that Poincare himself always stayed clear of it.  According to Poincare, "the crude data of experience, which are  our sensations,,,47 "have no spatial character" and "cannot give us the  notion of space. ,,48 This is confirmed, in particular, in the case of  visual sensations. Imagine a man who only has such sensations, say, a  paralytic with an anaesthetized skin, who stares at the world through  a single fixed eye. 49 A red sensation caused by the stimulation of the  upper edge of his retina and a red sensation caused by the stimulation  of its lower edge will appear to him as qualitatively different, essen­ tially incomparable sensations. They do not appear so to us, but as  qualitatively similar, though diversely located sensations, because we  can transform one into the other and vice versa by merely moving our  eyes up and down.50 (Attention: "moving my eyes up and down" is  here shorthand for "contriving to feel such and such a succession of </p><div id="pagenum"><p>muscular sensations"; remember that we do not have yet a space in </p></div><div id="pagenum"><p>342 CHAPTER 4 </p></div><p id="page">which to move.} Sensations arising from different nerves will there­ fore exemplify diverse incomparable qualities. But "sensations  furnished by the same nerve-fibre" can be ordered acc-ording to their  intensity. The aggregate of our sensations can be thus referred,  through "the active intervention of the mind", to "a sort of rubric or  category" which Poincare calls sensible space.51 He claims that this  space has as many dimensions as we possess nerve-fibres, but in fact,  if n is the number of such fibres, and we regard every distinct  sensation as a point of sensible space, it would be more accurate to  say that the latter is a one-dimensional topological manifold with n  components. Even this would not be perfectly accurate, however,  since, as we shall explain later, the different intensity scales which  constitute sensible space are not continuous in the exact mathemati­ cal, but only in the rough physical, sense of the word, so that none of  them can actually be mapped injectively onto a real interval. On the  other hand, we might consider each point of sensible space to be an  aggregate of simultaneous sensations, that is, what we shall call  hereafter a state of sense awareness. According to sensationism any  such state will vary continuously in a unique manner as the stimulus  acting on one particular nerve-tip is gradually modified while those  acting on all the other tips remain unchanged. The space of such  states is roughly an n-dimensional topological manifold, because the  set of all the states into which any state of sense awareness can thus  develop can be roughly charted into Rn. We shall refer to sensible  space, in the second acceptance, as the space of sense awareness.  Poincare assumes that the so-called muscular sensations can be  clearly distinguished from the rest. Some of the muscular sensations  are of a static kind, and can last a short time, just like a sweet taste or  a red after-image; e.g. the sensation of holding a 30 lb. bag, ten inches  above the ground (note however that the sensation will tend to change  in quality as one grows tired). But most of them can only be had in a  fleeting succession, woven as it were into a particular 'melodic'  pattern of such sensations. A voluntary change in the state of sense  awareness which is accompanied by a succession of muscular sensa­ tions is called an internal change. Poincare regards internal changes  as identical if they are accompanied by the same melodic pattern of  muscular sensations. Thus, turning your head to the right at the pole  or on the Equator, rising from your seat after a concert or after a </p><div id="pagenum"><p>faculty meeting, will cause the same internal changes. It is essential to </p></div><div id="pagenum"><p>EMPIRICISM, APRIORISM, CONVENTIONALISM 343 </p></div><p id="page">bear this in mind in the sequel. An involuntary change in our state of  sense awareness which is not accompanied by a succession of  muscular sensations is called an external change. External changes  are viewed as being identical only if they are qualitatively indis­ tinguishable. Consider an external change A which transforms a state  of sense awareness a into a state ~. There might be an internal  change A' which transforms a state indistinguishable from ~ into a  state indistinguishable from a. If such an A' exists, we say that it  cancels A, and we call both A and A' locomotions.52 We also give this  name to any combination of locomotions succeeding one another.  Such a combination is said to be cancelled by an internal change  which transforms its final state into its initial state. If locomotion A  transforms state a into state ~, and locomotion B transforms a state  qualitatively indistinguishable from ~ into state y. there is a conceiv­ able locomotion which is qualitatively indistinguishable from A  followed by B, which transforms a state qualitatively indistinguish­ able from a into a state qualitatively indistinguishable from y. We  denote this locomotion by A + B. A locomotion whose initial and final  states are the same will be said to be neutral. Since the same internal  change can transform a wide variety of initial states into a wide  variety of final states, it can obviously cancel many different locomo­ tions. All locomotions cancelled by the same internal change are  regarded as equivalent. We also regard two internal changes as  equivalent if they cancel the same locomotion. It might seem that  such equivalences are relative to a particular locomotion, which  cancels or is cancelled by every member of an equivalence class.  Poincare asserts, however, that it is an empirical fact that if locomo­ tions A and B are cancelled by locomotion A' and B is also cancelled  by locomotion B', then B' cancels A.53 If he is right, it follows that the  equivalence classes of locomotions mutually determine one another,  and equivalence is not relative to a particular locomotion.54 We may  also regard all neutral locomotions as equivalent. Moreover, if A is  equivalent to P and B is equivalent to Q, and if A + Band P + Q can  be defined as above, then A + B is equivalent to P + Q. Hereafter an  equivalence class of locomotions will be called a displacement.55 The  class of all neutral locomotions will be denoted by O. The set of all  displacements will be denoted by gj). Poincare tacitly assumes that if  a, b E gj), there is always some A E a and some B E b such that A + B </p><div id="pagenum"><p>is a conceivable locomotion. We define the sum a + b of a and b as </p></div><div id="pagenum"><p>344 CHAPTER 4 </p></div><p id="page">the equivalence class of A + B. Evidently a + b is defined for every a,  b E q]j only if every displacement a includes a locomotion which ends  up in a state where some locomotion belonging to any given dis­ placement b might begin. Such assumption is not inconsiderable and  does not follow from our definitions. It is implied, however, by an  even stronger assumption which Poincare makes as a matter of  course, namely, that if a is any displacement and a any state of sense  awareness, there is a locomotion A in a, whose initial state is a. Since  both assumptions can be refuted or corroborated by experience, but  neither is liable to final verification, we must regard them as empirical  hypotheses. Given that the operation + is clearly associative and that  every displacement a has an inverse a-I such that a + a-I = 0, the  weaker hypothesis is sufficient to prove that (q]j, +) is a group. The  stronger hypothesis implies moreover that this group has a realization  in the space of sense awareness. We call (q]j, +) the group of dis­ placements. Hereafter, we denote it by the name of its underlying set  q]j. Poincare's theory of geometry rests on the existence of group q]j.  An example will show how he understands it. Let N I and N2 be two  street corners in midtown New York, ninety yards apart; let V I and  V 2 be two street corners in Venice, on a straight lane, with sidewalk  and canal, also ninety yards apart. Let N, V denote the external  changes which I experience as I am carried from N I to N2 and from  V I to V 2, respectively. Both N and V are cancelled by the internal  change which I feel as I walk ninety yards in a straight line. N and V  are therefore equivalent. They both belong to the same displacement,  which we may call a 'translation' of 90 yards. Our example suggests  how the group of displacements can provide a foundation for  geometry, but it also raises a problem which Poincare has apparently  overlooked. V can also be cancelled by the internal change caused by  getting into a boat and rowing ninety yards. We shall not mind the  fact that this change will not cancel N -one could after all dig a canal  in Madison Avenue. The real difficulty lies elsewhere. The feeling of  rowing 90 yards might not differ from the feeling of rowing 150  yards with a second oarsman to help you, or even from the feeling of  rowing 0 yards if the boat is tied to a pier; moreover, there does not  appear to be any difference in our muscular sensations whether we  row the 90 yards in a straight line or in a circle with another person at  the rudder. It might seem that we can overcome the difficulty by </p><div id="pagenum"><p>eliminating from the class of locomotions all internal changes which </p></div><div id="pagenum"><p>EMPIRICISM, APRIORISM, CONVENTIONALISM 345 </p></div><p id="page">have neutral instances (displacement 0 could still be built from the  neutral external changes). But this will not do: the feeling of walking  any distance can be neutral if the ground happens to be moving under  your feet in the opposite direction (think of the 'mechanical carpets'  or passenger conveyor-belts which have been set up in some  airports). It does not seem possible to distinguish such cases from the  more familiar instances of walking, in terms of muscular sensations  alone. 56 Poincare could have objected that such anomalous situations  have no part in the formation of our geometrical ideas, and that when  they arise those ideas are already available and provide a suitable  framework for their interpretation. Be that as it may, I shall proceed  with my outline as if the difficulty did not exist.  Poincare's next step is to show that the group of displacements is,  as he says, continuous. In his paper "Le continu mathematique"  (1893)57 he had distinguished between the physical and the mathema­ tical continuum. His prototype of the latter is the ordered field R of  real numbers, with, I presume, the standard topology.58 However, he  also mentions "the mathematical continuum of n dimensions", by  which I imagine he means Rn, also with the standard topology. And I  dare say he would have regarded every topological manifold -that is,  every topological space which is locally homeomorphic with R n -as a  mathematical continuum.59 His idea of the physical continuum is  presented through an example. Let A, B, C denote weights of lO, 11  and 12 grammes, respectively, and assume that we can only perceive  differences in weight that are equal to or greater than two grammes.  "The crude results of experience can then be expressed by the  following relations:  A=B, B=C, A<C  which can be regarded as the formula of the physical continuum.,,60 It  should be noted that the relation between A and B and between Band  C is not one of identity, but of perceptual indiscernibility, and that it  is misleading to represent it by the symbol "=", since it is not even an  equivalence (it is symmetric and reflexive, but not transitive). Bearing  this in mind, I propose the following tentative characterization of  Poincare's physical continuum (which, by the way, might perhaps be  more properly called a mental or psychological continuum):  (A) A simple physical continuum is a triple (S, R, <) such that </p><div id="pagenum"><p>(i) S is a non-empty set; </p></div><div id="pagenum"><p>346 CHAPTER 4 </p></div><p id="page">(ii) R is a binary reflexive symmetric non-transitive relation in S  (read "aRb" as "a is indiscernible from b");  (iii) < is a binary asymmetric transitive relation in S (read  "a < b" as "a precedes b ");  (iv) if a, b E S and aRb, then neither a < b nor b < a;  (v) if a, b E S and not aRb, then either a < b or b < a;  (vi) if a, b, c E S and a < c < b, there is no xES such that aRx and  xRb;  (vii) S contains a non-empty subset L such that, if a, bEL and  a:f:. b, either a < b or b < a (in other words, L is linearly ordered by  <);  (viii) if a, bEL and a < b and there is no c E L such that a < c < b,  there is an xES such that aRx and xRb.  (ix) if a E S, there is abE L such that aRb.  (B) If a, b are two objects, we say that a simple physical continuum  (S, R, < ) joins a and b if a, b E S and for every xES, either aRx or  xRb or a < x < b or b < x < a.  (C) A connected physical continuum is a triple (S, R, <) such that  (i) conditions A(i)-(iv) are fulfilled;  (ii) if a, b E S, a and b are joined by a simple physical continuum  (J, R, <), where J C Sand Rand < are the restrictions to J of the  homonymous relations in S.  (D) A physical continuum is the union of a family of connected  physical continua.  In the Monist essay of 1898, Poincare argues that the group of  displacements is a physical continuum, but that, since such an entity  is "repugnant to reason", we must regard it as a mathematical  continuum. He reasons thus: A displacement can be added to itself  any number of times. In this way, we obtain different displacements  which may be regarded as mUltiples of the same displacement (if d is  a displacement and k a positive integer, we write kd for d + d + ... +  d, k times).  Now we soon discover that any displacement whatever can always be divided into two,  three, or any number of parts whatever; I mean that we can always find another  displacement which, repeated two, three times will reproduce the given displacement.  This divisibility to infinity conducts us naturally to the notion of mathematical  continuity; yet things are not so simple as they appear at first sight.  We cannot prove this divisibility to infinity, directly. When a displacement is very </p><div id="pagenum"><p>small, it is inappreciable for us. When two displacements differ very little, we cannot </p></div><div id="pagenum"><p>EMPIRICISM, APRIORISM, CONVENTIONALISM 347 </p></div><p id="page">distinguish them. If a displacement D is extremely small, its consecutive multiples will  be indistinguishable. It may happen then that we cannot distinguish 9D from 10D, nor  IOD from liD, but that we can nevertheless distinguish 9D from liD. If we wanted to  translate these crude facts of experience into a formula, we should write  9D= lOD, 10D= ltD, 9D< ltD.  Such would be the formula of physical continuity. But such a formula is repugnant to  reason. It corresponds to none of the models which we carry about in us. We escape  the dilemma by an artifice; and for this physical continuity -or, if you prefer, for this  sensible continuity, which is presented in a form unacceptable to our minds -we  substitute mathematical continuity. Severing our sensations from that something which  we call their cause, we assume that the something in question conforms to the model  which we carry about in us, and that our sensations deviate from it only in consequence  of their crudenessY  The formula quoted by Poincare is "repugnant to reason" only if  reason is foolish enough to read' =' as a symbol of identity, which in  this context it certainly is not. Hence, Poincare's ground for treating  the supposedly physical continuum of displacements as an ideal  mathematical continuum lacks cogency. I believe, however, that the  step into ideality had been taken earlier, when we defined displace­ ments as equivalence classes of locomotions. That definition was  predicated on the assumption that if locomotions A, B are cancelled  by the same locomotion, then A is cancelled by any locomotion which  cancels B. But this assumption will not be true if the group of dis­ placements is a physical continuum. For let d be a displacement such  that kd is discernible from (k + 2)d but not from (k + 1)d (where k is  a positive integer). An instance of (k + l)d is cancelled then by an  instance of krl and by an instance of (k + 2)d-t, but only the former  and not the latter will cancel an instance of kd.62 As a matter of fact,  the italicized assumption is false (see Note 54). But unless we make it,  the set of locomotions cannot be partitioned into displacements. Such  partition is therefore an idealization, which draws neat boundaries  where experience is fuzzy. The group ~ obtained by the partition is  certainly not a physical continuum and there is no immediately  apparent reason why it should be a mathematical one. Poincare's  ground for conceiving it as such might still be defended however in a  modified form: since the set of locomotions which provides the em­ pirical basis for our idealization is indeed a physical continuum, the  ideal set of displacements must be thought of as a mathematical con­</p><div id="pagenum"><p>tinuum. This argument will not do, however, because displacements </p></div><div id="pagenum"><p>348 CHAPTER 4 </p></div><p id="page">are classes of which locomotions are elements.63 When we par­ tition the latter into the former, introducing an unreal definiteness  by fiat, we must arbitrarily distribute doubtful cases between border­ ing classes, but the resulting classification need not be a mathematical  continuum (think of the partition of the rainbow into seven colours).  However, in order to proceed with our outline of Poincare's doctrine  we shall assume hereafter that rllJ is indeed a mathematical continuum,  i.e. a topological manifold. Poincare evidently assumes as well,  without saying so, that the group product + and the mapping d ~ d-I  (d E rllJ) are continuous in the agreed topology, so that the group of  displacements is a topological group.  The observable features of the physical continuum of locomotions  suggest the specific structure of the topological group rllJ. Let A be a  locomotion which transforms state a into state {3. Suppose that there  is a sensation CT, common to a and {3, which remains unchanged  throughout A. In practice, of course, a sensation will only remain  roughly unchanged throughout a locomotion, but we idealize this into  perfect constancy. We say then that A fixes CT. Let a be the  equivalence class of A. If every element of a fixes some sensation,  we call a a rotative displacement or a rotation. A non-rotative  displacement will be called a translation. In order to simplify some  statements we agree to regard 0 as being both a rotation and a  translation (although not every locomotion in 0 fixes a sensation). A  locomotion belonging to a rotation is called a rotative locomotion. We  now list some properties of rllJ which, according to Poincare, are  suggested by experience. I take him to mean that any reasonable  partition of locomotions into displacements will roughly agree with  the following statements:  (i) Let H be the set of all rotative locomotions which start from a  particular state of sense awareness a and fix a particular sensation CT;  let 7Jf be the set of the displacements to which the locomotions in H  belong; then 7Jf is a subgroup of rllJ, which we term a rotative  subgroup; rllJ contains rotative subgroups.  (ii) Any two rotative subgroups of rllJ have more than just the  neutral displacement 0 in common.  (iii) If X is the intersection of two rotative subgroups of ~, X is an  Abelian subgroup of ~ called a rotative sheaf (i.e. if a, b E X, </p><div id="pagenum"><p>a+b=b+a). </p></div><div id="pagenum"><p>EMPIRICISM, APRIORISM, CONVENTION ALISM 349 </p></div><p id="page">(iv) The rotative sheaf determined by two rotative subgroups of q;  is contained in an infinity of rotative subgroups of q;.  (v) A rotative sheaf is contained in a maximal Abelian group, the  helicoidal subgroup of q; determined by the sheaf.  (vi) Any rotation belonging to a rotative subgroup 'Je is the sum of  three rotations x, y, z E 'Je, belonging to three different rotative sheafs.  (vii) If a displacement a commutes with every element of a rotative  subgroup 'Je, a E 'Je.  (viii) Any displacement is the sum of two rotations belonging to  two given rotative subgroups.  (vi) and (viii) imply that, given three rotative sheaves 'J{1o 'J{2, 'J{3  belonging to a rotative subgroup 'Je, and three rotative sheaves 'J{4, 'J{5,  'J{6 belonging to a second rotative subgroup 'Je', any displacement d  can be represented as a sum of displacements hi + h2 + h3 + h4 + hs +  h6, with hj E 'J{j.  Poincare asserts that if q; has these properties it is isomorphic with  one of the three classical groups of motions, characteristic of the  geometries "of Euclid, ... Lobatchevsky and Riemann".64 q; is  isomorphic with the Euclidean group if, and only if, it contains a  proper normal subgroup. Experience agrees well with the assumption  that the set of translations is such a normal subgroup (in other words,  that for every displacement d and every translation t there is a  translation t' such that d + t = t' + d).  Poincare's reconstruction of the group of displacements as a  Euclidean group of motions is not sufficient to explain the origin of  geometry. In the terminology of p.337, we can say that we need to find  a transitive faithful realization of the Euclidean group in a topological  space homeomorphic with R3. But Poincare conceives q; as a group  acting on the space of sense awareness described on p.342, which, as  I said there, is roughly homeomorphic with Rn (n ~ 3).65 The action of  q; on such space is a mapping assigning to every state of sense  awareness a and to every displacement d a state of sense awareness  da, which is the transform of a by some locomotion in d, and which  we may call the effect of d on a. The existence of such a mapping ob­ viously presupposes (i) that for any given state of sense awareness a,  each displacement d includes some locomotion which begins at a (this  is the 'strong assumption' which I attributed to Poincare on p.344); </p><div id="pagenum"><p>(ii) that any two locomotions belonging to the same displacement </p></div><div id="pagenum"><p>350 CHAPTER 4 </p></div><p id="page">d and beginning by the same state a, transform a into one and the  same state da. The properties of group action (p.I72) preclude ~  from acting on the space of sense awareness as it is really given. The  latter is a physical continuum. In order that ~ may act on it it must  be idealized into a proper mathematical continuum, which is not just  roughly, but exactly, homeomorphic with Rn. The idealized manifold  provides a basis for the realization of ~, which however obviously  differs from the realization studied in ordinary geometry, for n is  much larger than 3. "How shall we escape the difficulty? Evidently by  replacing the group which is given us, together with its form and its  material, by another isomorphic group, the material of which is  simpler. ,,66 We shall not dwell on the allegedly psychological descrip­ tions through which Poincare tries to show how this simplification is  suggested by human experience. They are lengthy and not altogether  clear.67 I propose instead a construction which I regard as essentially  equivalent to his. I proceed in two steps: I outline first a mathematical  argument which I deem necessary to support the mathematical  conclusions of his psychological inquiry; this will enable me to  explain then, simply and concisely, what I take to be the gist of his  conclusions. We assume, as before, that ~ is isomorphic with the  Euclidean group of motions. ~ is therefore a topological group  homeomorphic with R6 (p.174). We denote the. subgroup of trans­ lations by fT. fT is a normal subgroup homeomorphic with R3. Let I  be the set of all the rotative sub-groups of ~. Let :1't'o be a given  element of I. Then each :1't' E I is equal. to t:1't'orl, for some t E fT.  Moreover, the mapping f: t t-+ t:1't'ot-1 is a bijection of fT onto I. Let  Z c I be open in I whenever F1(Z) is open in fT. With this topology,  I is homeomorphic with fT, and hence with R3. Let dE qj). Let fd  denote the mapping :1't't-+ d:l{ (:I{ E I), where d:l{, as on p.338, is the  left coset of :I{ by d. fd is a permutation or transformation of I (p.337). It  is not difficult to see that f: d t-+ fd (d E qj) is a realization of qj) in I. We  see at once that in such realization every :1't' E I is its own stability  group.68 Consequently, f is similar to the standard realization of qj) in  qj) 1:1't' described on p.338. f is therefore transitive. Moreover, f is faithful,  because no rotative subgroup of qj) contains a proper normal subgroup.  We have found thus a faithful, transitive and, moreover, immanent  realization of qj) in a space homeomorphic with R3. I fear, however, that  many a reader will look down upon it as just another piece of algebraic </p><div id="pagenum"><p>abracadabra, incapable of giving an insight into the origin of geometry. </p></div><div id="pagenum"><p>EMPIRICISM, APRIORISM, CONVENTIONALISM 351 </p></div><p id="page">Let us therefore inject some psychological blood into it. Choose an  arbitrary state of sense-awareness a. If 'J{ is a rotative subgroup of qjJ, we  let 'J{a stand for the set {ha I h E 'J{}, where ha denotes, as before, the  effect of the rotation h on the state a. According to our definition of a  rotative subgroup (p.348, (i» there will be a unique (idealized) sensation  which is common to all the elements of 'J{a' We call it the sensation fixed  by 'J{ at a and denote it by u('J{, a). Let Ia be the set of all sensations  fixed at a by some rotative subgroup 'J{ E I. The definition of a rotative  subgroup also implies that u('J{, a) = u('J{', a) if, and only if, 'J{ = 'J{'.  Consequently g: 1(~u(1(, a) is a bijective mapping of I onto Ia. By  stipUlating that Z C Ia is open whenever g-I(Z) is open, we make Ia into  a topological space homeomorphic with R 3. Let f denote once more the  realization of qjJ in I which was described above. The mapping  d ~ gf~ -led E qjJ) is a realization of qjJ in Ia, which is clearly similar to f.  Since a is arbitrary, the realization does not depend on its particular  nature. Ia may stand, therefore, for the pure three-dimensional space of  Euclidean geometry.  Such is the genesis of geometry according to Poincare. Experience  plays in it an essential but not a decisive role. Empirical data have  been repeatedly idealized to fit our schemata: first, in the constitution  of the displacement group and the refinement of the space of sense­ awareness into a topological space on which this group can act; then,  in order to ensure that the said group is one of the classical groups of  motions and indeed is none other than the Euclidean group. The  process of idealization has so divorced geometry from sense­ experience that, though we can very well conceive the infinite, iso­ tropic, homogeneous, mathematically continuous space of geometry,  we are unable to visualize it by any stretch of the imagination. "We  cannot represent to ourselves objects in geometrical space, but can  merely reason upon them as if they existed in that space. ,,69 Our  idealizations follow, so to speak, the line of least resistance. They are,  Poincare insists, suggested by experience. But they are nonetheless  free. A different set of idealizations would yield a clumsier, more  contorted, but equally admissible framework for the registration and  communication of scientific facts. "Transported to another world, we  might undoubtedly have a different geometry, not because our  geometry would have ceased to be true, but because it would have  become less convenient than another. ,,70 Might not a broadened </p><div id="pagenum"><p>experience eventually lead us to substitute a different geometry for </p></div><div id="pagenum"><p>352 CHAPTER 4 </p></div><p id="page">our Euclidean system? In 1891, Poincare starkly denied it: "Euclidean  geometry is and will remain the most comfortable one.,,71 But in 1898,  he readily granted that "if our experiences should be considerably  different, the geometry of Euclid would no longer suffice to represent  them conveniently, and we should choose a different geometry".72  4.4.6 The Definition of Dimension Number  Poincare is one of the Founding Fathers of topology.73 In his  philosophical writings, he repeatedly stressed the importance of the  "qualitative geometry", analysis situs, underlying the more familiar  "quantitative geometry".74 In this discipline, he observes, two figures  are equivalent whenever any of them can be made to take the shape  of the other by a process of continuous deformation. 75 When viewed  topologically, space appears cohesive like rubber, but not rigid like  glass. It is a continuum amorphe, as Poincare, anticipating Grunbaum,  is pleased to call it.76 One might be tempted to think that even if the  choice of a metric geometry is a conventional matter, the underlying  "formless continuum" presupposed by such geometry is somehow  imposed on us by experience or by our mental make-up. But Poincare  will have none of it. In particular, "the fundamental proposition of  analysis situs", namely that space has three dimensions/7 is, accord­ ing to him, no less conventional than the definition of distance.  Poincare tried twice to prove that the number of dimensions of  physical space is fixed by convention, in 1903 and in 1912. 78 The  substance of his argument was given in Section 4.4.5 (p.350). The only  space that may be said to be imposed on us by the nature of sense  data or by our psychophysiological constitution is the space of sense  awareness -viewed of course as a physical, not as a mathematical  continuum. This space has much more than three dimensions; ac­ cording to Poincare it has as many dimensions as we have in­ dependently excitable nerve-tips. The reduction of spatial dimensions  to three is the outcome of a process of idealization and simplification  involving several free decisions.  In our discussion of this matter in Section 4.4.5, we did not attempt  to probe into the nature of spatial dimensions. We regarded a topolo­ gical space as n-dimensional whenever it was globally or at least  locally homeomorphic with Rn. This definition of dimension number  would be ambiguous and hence useless if Rn could be mapped </p><div id="pagenum"><p>homeomorphically into Rn+p for some p'l- O. Brouwer proved in 1911 </p></div><div id="pagenum"><p>EMPIRICISM, APRIORISM, CONVENTION ALISM 353 </p></div><p id="page">that this is impossible. Brouwer's proof justifies the use of the  preceding concept of dimension number in certain contexts, but it  throws no light on the structural property shared by R" and its  homeomorphic images, by virtue of which they are said to be n­ dimensional. As early as 1893, Poincare had proposed a charac­ terization of this property which, though unsatisfactory, provided one  of the starting points of modern topological dimension theory.79  Poincare does not define dimension, but dimension number, that is,  a correspondence assigning a characteristic positive integer to each  continuum. The correspondence is defined recursively: Poincare  determines which continua have dimension 1, and stipulates that an  arbitrary continuum has dimension n when certain subcontinua of it  have dimension n -1. Poincare's definition of dimension number is  motivated by a familiar fact, which any child might state thus: in  order to divide a thread into two separate parts it is enough to cut it at  one or more points; in order to divide a leaf of paper you must cut it  along one or more lines; in order to divide a solid body, you must cut  it across one or more surfaces The same fact was expressed in more  general terms by Euclid when he said that the boundaries of bodies  are surfaces, the boundaries of surfaces are lines and the boundaries  of lines are dimensionless points. so In his paper of 1893 on the  mathematical continuum and again in his paper of 1903 on space and  its three dimensions, Poincare defines an n-dimensional physical  continuum in a manner that is clearly inspired by the said fact.  The reader will recall our axiomatic characterization of physical  continua on p.345f. Poincare seeks to define the dimension number of  a connected physical continuum by means of the idea of a cut which  divides it or disconnects it. He describes a cut C in a connected  physical continuum K as an arbitrary subset of K, which can there­ fore consist of one or more distinct and separate elements of K or of  one or more subcontinua of K. We might feel inclined to say that a  cut C in a connected physical continuum K divides or disconnects K  if removal of C deprives K of its structure as a connected physical  continuum, (specifically, if K - C does not satisfy the condition (C)(ii)  prescribed on p.346 for any connected physical continuum S). We  could then define a one-dimensional connected physical continuum K  as one which is disconnected by a cut consisting of separate points,  i.e. by a subset of K whose elements do not coalesce with each other </p><div id="pagenum"><p>to form a continuum. A connected physical continuum K would be </p></div><div id="pagenum"><p>354 CHAPTER 4 </p></div><p id="page">said to be n-dimensional if n is the least positive integer such that K  is disconnected by a cut consisting of a collection of one or more  separate (n -I)-dimensional connected physical continua. Though  seemingly adequate, this characterization cannot satisfy us. Simple  physical continua, which we certainly wish to regard as one-dimen­ sional, may remain connected after the removal of a finite and even of  a countable collection of separate elements. For any such element E  belonging to a simple physical continuum K is indiscernible from  elements E), E2, ••• which are not removed from K by the excision of  E. If, as is usual, some of these elements Eb E2, ••• are also indis­ cernible from each other, removal of E will not break the connected­ ness of K. Similar considerations apply to non-simple physical  continua. Take, for instance, the continuum of sounds, ordered by  pitch and intensity. One would naturally expect it to be two-dimen­ sional. One would also regard the continuum of all sounds of a given  pitch as a one-dimensional subcontinuum of it. Yet the continuum of  sounds is not disconnected, in the sense defined above, by the  continuum of all sounds of a definite pitch. For every sound S of the  chosen pitch there exist sounds S' and S" such that S, S' and S" are  indiscernible from one another but S' is also indiscernible from a  sound SL of perceptibily lower pitch than S, and S" is indiscernible  from a sound SH of perceptibly higher pitch than S. S' and S" cannot  therefore be said to have the same pitch as S and are not removed  from the continuum of sounds together with all the sounds of that  pitch. Yet, being indiscernible from one another, they can repre­ sent the excised pitch, and thus preserve the connectedness of the  continuum of sounds. This example shows that a definition of dimen­ sion number of physical continua, based on the idea of a cut, cannot  ignore the fact that any element of a physical continuum K has a  'fringe' formed by all the elements of K which are indiscernible from  it. We define the fringe of a subset S C K as the set S* = {x I x E K and  x is indiscernible from some element of S}. We define, as before, a  cut in a connected physical continuum K as an arbitrary subset of K.  If S c K and the continuum structure of K is determined, as on p.346,  by two binary relations Rand <, we designate by (S, R, <) the  structure determined on S by the restriction of Rand < to S. Let C be  a cut in a connected physical continuum K, structured by relations R  and <. Let C* be the fringe of C. We say that K is disconnected by C </p><div id="pagenum"><p>if and only if (K -C*, R, <) is not a connected physical continuum. </p></div><div id="pagenum"><p>EMPIRICISM, APRIORISM, CONVENTIONALISM 355 </p></div><p id="page">C will be said to be O-dimensional if it consists of a non-empty collec­ tion of elements of K, which does not contain a subcontinuum of K.  C will be said to be n-dimensional if it can be represented as a  collection of n-dimensional connected physical continua but it cannot  be represented as a collection of (n + p )-dimensional connected phy­ sical continua for any positive integer p. We can now define: A  connected physical continuum K is n-dimensional if, and only if, n is  the least positive integer such that K is disconnected by an (n -1)­ dimensional cut in K. A physical continuum K is n-dimensional if n is  the largest positive integer such that K can be represented as a family  of n-dimensional connected physical continua. These definitions, as  the reader can verify, agree substantially with those given by  Poincare.81  In the two papers of 1893 and 1903 that we mentioned above,  Poincare attempts to show how the concept of a mathematical  continuum is built by idealization from that of a physical continuum.  (See p.346.) However, in neither of them does he extend to mathema­ tical continua his new definition of dimension number, but is content  to repeat the commonplace that a mathematical continuum is n­ dimensional if n real-valued coordinate functions are required for  labelling its points.82 Yet the application of the new definition to  mathematical continua is immediate, as Poincare showed in 1912, in  the paper entitled "Why space has three dimensions?" There, he first  defines the dimension number of mathematical continua using the  idea of a cut, and then adds that the proposed definition can also be  extended to physical continua. Since each element of a mathematical  continuum is distinct and discernible from the others, the definition of  dimension number for such continua need not use the concept of a  fringe. Poincare does not state exactly what he means by a mathema­ tical continuum. His notion of it is akin to but probably narrower than  that of a topological space. (See p.360.) Assuming that any mathe­ matical continuum in Poincare's sense is also a topological space, we  can define a path in a mathematical continuum K as a continuous  mapping of an interval of the real line R into K. In particular, a  mapping c of a closed interval [a, b) into K will be said to join points  x and y in K if x = c(a) and y = c(b). We say that K is a path­ connected mathematical continuum or a pmc if each pair of elements  of K is joined by a path in K. For simplicity's sake, we agree to </p><div id="pagenum"><p>describe any singleton contained in a pmc K, i.e. any subset of K </p></div><div id="pagenum"><p>356 CHAPTER 4 </p></div><p id="page">which has only a single member, as a 'O-dimensional sub continuum  of K'. If n is any positive integer, an 'n-dimensional subcontinuum  of K' is simply a subset of K which is a pmc in its own right (with the  structure induced in it by the continuum structure of K) and is  n-dimensional according to the definition we shall now give. These  agreements suffice to make sense of the following recursive  definition:  A pmc K is n-dimensional (n a positive integer) if there is a sequence X = (XI> X2 •••• j  of (n -I)-dimensional subcontinua of K, such that for some pair a, b of elements of K,  not belonging to the union of X, the range of every path in K joining a and b intersects  the union of X.  The dimension number of an arbitrary mathematical continuum can  of course be determined in an obvious manner by the dimension  number of its path-connected components.  According to the definition we have given, R" and every topological  space which is locally homeomorphic to R" are n-dimensional. The  definition certainly throws light on the structural properties shared by  such spaces by virtue of which they are said to be n-dimensional. On  the other hand, the definition leads to unreasonable results if applied  to topological spaces which are only moderately more general. Con­ sider for example the surface S generated in Euclidean 3-space by the  revolution of two intersecting straight lines about the bisector of one of  the two pairs of vertically opposite angles formed by them. As a part of  Euclidean 3-space, S can be regarded as a topological space with  standard subset topology.83 But S, with this topology, is not two­ dimensional according to our definition, but one-dimensional, since the  intersection P of the generators of S is a point of S such that the  repetitious sequence ({P}, {P}, {P}, ... ) of O-dimensional subcontinua of  S satisfies the description of sequence X in our definition of dimension  number.  The preceding example is mentioned by L.E.J. Brouwer in his  paper on the natural concept of dimension (1913) as a serious objection  against Poincare's definition of dimension number. Brouwer proposed  in that paper a new definition which was later perfected by Urysohn  (1922, 1925, 1926) and Menger (1923, 1924). The concept thus  obtained is known in contemporary dimension theory as inductive </p><div id="pagenum"><p>dimension. Let S be any topological space. If S' is a subset of S we </p></div><div id="pagenum"><p>EMPIRICISM, APRIORISM, CONVENTIONALISM 357 </p></div><p id="page">agree to regard S' as a topological space whose open sets are the  intersections of S' with the open sets of S. With this topology, S' is a  subspace of S. In particular, the empty set 0 is a subspace of every  space. We agree that 0 (and only 0) has inductive dimension -1. A  topological space S is said to have inductive dimension n if n is the  least non-negative integer such that for each point xES and each  open neighbourhood V of x there exists an open neighbourhood U of  x such that U C V and the boundary of U has inductive dimension  n -1.84 Having been defined exclusively by means of general topolo­ gical concepts, inductive dimension is evidently a topological in­ variant; in other words, any two topologically equivalent  (homeomorphic) spaces have the same inductive dimension. Inductive  dimension possesses two more features which one would naturally  expect any satisfactory concept of dimension number to share: (i) the  inductive dimension of R n and of every space locally homeomorphic  to R n is n; (ii) if S is an arbitrary topological space and S' is a  subspace of S, the inductive dimension of S' is less than, or equal to,  the inductive dimension of S. Unfortunately, as far as we can tell,  inductive dimension does not lend itself to the development of a rich  theory. That is probably the main reason why mathematicians have  proposed other concepts of dimension number for topological spaces.  The two most important of them -namely the so-called "large" in­ ductive dimension defined in Note 84 and the covering dimension  characterized below -agree with inductive dimension on an important  class of spaces85 but not on all. These two concepts are, of course,  topological invariants and they both share the above mentioned  feature (i). They can also be shown to possess feature (ii) if S is  assumed to be a totally normal space.86  In 1911, commenting on Brouwer's up to that time unpublished  proof that R n canriot be mapped homeomorphic ally onto R n+p unless </p><div id="pagenum"><p>Fig. 22. </p></div><div id="pagenum"><p>358 CHAPTER 4 </p></div><p id="page">p = 0, Henri Lebesgue suggested a completely different approach to  the concept of dimension number.87 He observed that if D is a finite  open connected subset of R n its closure D can be covered by a finite  collection of closed sets Eh ... , Ek such that some points of D belong  to n + 1 of these sets but no point of D belongs to more than n + 1 of  them. (Lebesgue (1911), p.166.) Lebesgue's remark is illustrated in  Fig. 22 for the case n = 2. In 1933, tech introduced a concept of  dimension number applicable to general topological spaces which is  based on Lebesgue's remark. This is now known as covering dimen­ sion. In order to characterize it, we need a few new terms. A cover of  a set S is a family of subsets of S such that each element of S belongs  to at least one of the members of the family. The cover is said to be  'of order equal to or less than n' if each point in S belongs to at most  n + 1 members of the cover. If K and K' are two covers of Sand  every member of K is contained in some member of K', K is said to  be a refinement of K'. A cover of a topological space or a refinement  of such a cover are said to be open if they consist of open sets. We  now define the covering dimension of a topological space S as the  least integer n such that every finite open C(lver of S has a finite open </p><div id="pagenum"><p>refinement of order equal to or less than n. </p></div><div id="pagenum"><p>APPENDIX </p></div><p id="page">1. MAPPINGS  Let A and B be sets, such that at least B is non-empty. A mapping  I: A ~ B assigns to each element x of A a unique element I(x) of B.  We denote I by xt-+ I(x). A is the domain of I (dom f), Bits  codomain. I(x) is the value of I at argument x. The collection of all  values of f is its range or image (im f). If the codomain of I equals its  range, I is said to be surjective or a surjection. The collection of all  arguments at which I takes a given value is the fibre of lover that  value. If each fibre of I is a singleton (i.e. if it contains only one  element of A), f is said to be injective or an injection. If A is a subset  of B, the mapping xt-+ x is called the canonical injection of A into B.  A mapping both injective and surjective is said to be bijective or a  bijection. If I is bijective, its inverse rl: B ~ A is the mapping f(x) t-+ x.  If U is any subset of A and V is any subset of B we denote by I(U) the set  of all values of f at arguments belonging to U and by rl(V) the set of all  arguments at which f takes values belonging to V (note that the latter set  may well be empty). The restriction of f to U, denoted by flu, is the  mapping g: U ~ B which is such that g(x) = I(x) for every x in U. If  I: A ~ Band g: B ~ C are mappings, the composite mapping g . f: A ~ C  assigns the value g(f(x» to each x in A.  2. ALGEBRAIC STRUCTURES. GROUPS  Let S be a non-empty set. Let n denote the set of the first n natural  numbers. An ordered n-tuple or n-list of elements of S is a mapping  n ~ S. We denote it by (ao, ab a2, ... , a,-I), where aj stands for the  value of the list at j. The collection of all such lists is designated by  So. An n-ary operation on S is a mapping S' ~ S. An algebraic  structure is an (r + I)-list (S,!I. ... , f,), where Ii is an ni-ary operation  on the set S (1 ~ i ~ r). S is the structure's underlying set. One often  designates an algebraic structure by the name of its underlying set, or  vice versa. </p><div id="pagenum"><p>359 </p></div><div id="pagenum"><p>360 APPENDIX </p></div><p id="page">A group is an algebraic structure (G, 1>, where I is a binary  operation or product on set G that fulfils the following requirements;  (i) I is associative, that is, I(x, I(y, z» = l(f(x, y), z) for any x, y, z  in G.  (ii) for every x and y in G there are elements u and v in G such  that I(x, u) = I(v, x) = y.  These requirements imply that there exists a neutral element in the  group, that is, an element e E G such that I(e, x) = I(x, e) = x for  every x E G; and that for every x E G there exists a unique inverse  X-I E G, such that I(x, X-I) = l(x- 1, x) = e.  Let H C G. Let i; H -+ G be the canonical injection. If (H, g) is a  group and the restriction of I to H2 equals the composite mapping  i . g, (H, g) is a subgroup of (G,I>. If this condition is satisfied and for  every a E H, bEG, I(b, I(a, b-1» belongs to H, (H, g) is said to be a  normal subgroup of (G, 1>. Note that both (G, I> itself and the group  whose underlying set consists of the neutral element e E G alone are  subgroups of (G, I> according to our definition. They are referred to  as improper subgroups while all other subgroups of (G, I> are said to  be proper.  Let (G, g) and (H, h) be groups. A mapping f; G -+ H is a group  homomorphism if for any x and y in G, h(f(x),f(y» = I(g(x, y». If I  is bijective, it is a group isomorphism. Two groups are said to be  isomorphic if there is a group isomorphism that maps the underlying  set of one onto that of the other.  If x, y belong to a group (G, f), one usually writes xy for I(x, y).  Further information on groups and other algebraic structures can  be obtained from any good textbook of algebra, such as S. MacLane  and G. Birkhoff, Algebra (New York; Macmillan, 1967). The reader  will do well to take a look at the definitions of rings, fields, modules,  vector spaces and lattices if he is not already familiar with them.  3. TOPOLOGIES  Let S be any set and T a collection of subsets of S. T is a topology on  S and the pair (S, T) is a topological space if the following four  conditions are satisfied: (i) SET; (ii) the empty set 0 E T; (iii) the  union of every collection of members of T belongs to T; (iv) the  intersection of any two members of T belongs to T. A collection B of  subsets of S is a base of the topology T if every member of B belongs </p><div id="pagenum"><p>to T and every non-empty member of T is a union of members of B. </p></div><div id="pagenum"><p>APPENDIX 361 </p></div><p id="page">A member of T is called an open set, its complement (relative to S) is  a closed set. the elements of S are its points. If xES' C S and there is  an open set S" such that xES" C S', S' is said to be a neighbourhood  of x. If S' itself is open it is called an open neighbourhood. Let We S.  The set {x I x has a neighbourhood entirely contained in W} is called  the interior of W or Int W. W is open if, and only if, Int W = W. The  set {x I each neighbourhood of x contains an element of W} is called  the closure of Wand is denoted by W. W is closed if, and only if,  W = W. Let Y be the complement of W (relative to S). The inter­ section of Wand Y is the boundary of W (and of Y).  If T and T' are two topologies on the same set Sand T C T', T is  weaker or coarser than T' (and T' is stronger or finer than T).  A topological space (S, T) is connected unless it is the union of two  non-empty disjoint open sets.  Let S be any set. A collection of sets whose union contains S is  called a cover of S. If K and K' are two covers of Sand K' C K, K' is  a subcover of K. If T is a topology on S, T is obviously a cover of S.  A subcover of T is called an open cover of S. A topological space  (S, T) is compact if every open cover of S has a finite subcover.  Let (S, T) be a topological space. Let S' be any subset of S and let  T' designate the set {S' n W I WET}. It can be easily verified that T' is  a topology on S', known as the topology induced on S' by T. (S', T') is  a topological subspace of (S, T).  Let (S, T) and (S', T') be topological spaces. A mapping I: S ~ S' is  said to be open if 1 maps every open set of S onto an open set of S'; it  is said to be continuous if, for every open set Y of S' the set  {x I I(x) E Y} is an open set of S. An open and continuous bijective  mapping f: S ~ S' is called an homeomorphism. Two topological  spaces are homeomorphic if there is a homeomorphism that maps the  underlying set of one into that of the other.  Further information on topological spaces can be gathered from  J.R. Munkres, Topology.  4. DIFFERENTIABLE MANIFOLDS  I assume that the reader is familiar with the rudiments of linear  algebra and analysis. (Behnke et al., Fundamentals 01 Mathematics,  Vol. I, Chapter 3 and Vol. III, Chapters 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5 contain all the </p><div id="pagenum"><p>information needed.) The following notes summarize some basic </p></div><div id="pagenum"><p>362 APPENDIX </p></div><p id="page">definitions and results concerning differentiable manifolds. To make  some matters simpler we shall aim at less than maximum generality.  For the sake of brevity some concepts (e.g. the Lie bracket) will not  be introduced in the most natural manner. The reader may turn for  further details to the books by Spivak (ClOG), Matsushima (DM) and  Malliavin (GDI) mentioned in the Reference list.  Let us recall that a mapping { of an open subset of R n into R m is  said to be of class Ck at a point P in its domain if all its partial  derivatives of order k exist and are continuous at P. If this is true of  every integer k, { is said to be of class C'" at P. If { can be expanded  into a power series on a neighbourhood of P, { is said to be analytic at  P. The qualification 'at P' is dropped if the aforesaid conditions hold  good for every point in dom {.  Let S be a set. An n-dimensional real-valued chart of S is a  bijective mapping of a subset of S onto an open subset of R n. Let {  and g be two n-dimensional real-valued charts of S. { and g are  Ck-compatible if the sets {(dom g ndom f) and g(dom {ndom g)­ that is, the ranges of the restrictions of { and g to the intersection of  dom { and dom g -are open in R n, and the restrictions of the  composite mapping g . r1 to the former set and of { . g-l to the latter  are mappings of class Ck. An n-dimensional real-valued Ck-atlas of S  is a collection A of n-dimensional real-valued charts of S such that (i)  any two charts in A are Ck-compatible, and (ii) the collection of the  domains of the charts in A is a cover of S. An n-dimensional real  Ck-differentiable manifold is a pair {S, A). where S is a set and A is an  n-dimensional real-valued Ck-atlas of S. The set of all conceivable  n-dimensional real-valued charts of S which are Ck-compatible with  each chart in A is the maximal Ck-atlas determined by A and will be  denoted by Ami.' The weakest topology on S which makes every chart  in Am.. into a continuous mapping is the natural topology of the  differentiable manifold (S, A). If PES and x is a chart defined on a  neighbourhood of P, x is said to be a chart at P.  An n-dimensional complex differentiable manifold is defined  analogously. (Substitute complex for real and C for R throughout the  foregoing paragraph.)  Henceforth, we shall consider only n-dimensional real C"'-differen­ tiable manifolds with a natural Hausdorff topology. We call them  simply n-manifolds. (Recall that a topological space is Hausdorff if </p><div id="pagenum"><p>for every pair of points P and Q there is a neighbourhood N p of P and </p></div><div id="pagenum"><p>APPENDIX 363 </p></div><p id="page">a neighbourhood No of Q such that Np nNo = 0.) We regard Rn (for  every positive integer n) as an n-manifold with the differentiable  structure determined by the atlas whose only chart is the identity  mapping x ~ x, defined on all R n.  Let M be an m-manifold with an atlas A and let N be an n-manifold  with an atlas B. We define the product manifold M x N by the fol­ lowing stipulations: (i) the underlying set of M x N is the Cartesian  product of the underlying sets of M and N; (ii) for each chart x in  Amax and each chart y in Bmax the maximal atlas of M x N contains an  (m + n )-dimensional chart z which assigns to each pair (P, Q) in  dom x x dom y the (m + n)-tuple (x(P), y(Q».  If M is an m-manifold and N is an n-manifold, a mapping f: M 4 N  is said to be Ck-differentiable at a point P E M if for any chart x at P  and any chart y at f(P) the composite mapping y . f . X-I is of class Ck  at x(P). (The reader should verify that this property does not depend  on the choice of x and y.) A Ck-differentiable bijection is called a  Ck-dijfeomorphism if its inverse is Ck-differentiable. Two manifolds  are said to be Ck-dijfeomorphic if there exists a Ck-diffeomorphism  of one onto the other.  Let M be an n-manifold and let f: M 4 R be Cl-differentiable at a  point P E M. If x is a chart at P, the mapping f . X-I is defined and has  continuous first-order partial derivatives on a neighbourhood U of  x(P). Let this mapping be denoted by F. F maps an open subset of R n  into R. We introduce the following notation:  F.( )=1' F(at. ... ,a;+h, ... ,an)-F(a)  .1 a 1m h '  h-O()  af ~=F··x ax' ,I ,  (where a = (at., .. , an) is an arbitrary point of U). (1)  Let M be an n-manifold and let (a, b) be an open interval of R. A  Ck -differentiable mapping c: (a, b) 4 M is called a Ck -path in M. We  can also consider Ck -paths defined on a closed interval [a, b] pro­ vided that we regard them as the restrictions to [a, b] of Ck-paths  defined on some open interval that contains [a, b]. If c: (a, b) ~ M is a  Ck-path and h: R ~ R is an homeomorphism, the mapping c' given by  c' = c . h -I is a reparametrization of c by h. </p><div id="pagenum"><p>Let M be an n-manifold. Consider a Cl-path c in M, defined on an </p></div><div id="pagenum"><p>364 APPENDIX </p></div><p id="page">open interval (a, b) such that a < 0 < b. Let c(O) = P. A path fulfilling  these conditions will be called 'a suitable path through P'. We now  define a ring of real valued functions which we shall denote by ~k(p):  (i) for every neighbourhood U of P (in M), the underlying set of ~k(p)  includes every Ck -differentiable mapping f: U ~ R; (ii) the ring  operations are given by the following rules:  (f + g)(Q) = f(Q) + g(Q),  fg(Q) = f(Q)g(Q), (2)  for every f, g E ~k(p) and every Q E dom f ndom g .. If a is any real  number, we let a denote the constant function M ~ R; Q ~ a which  obviously belongs to ~k(p) for all P E M and every positive integer k.  t shall designate the identity mapping of R onto itself. The vector c(O)  tangent to path c at P = c(O) is the function ~l(p) ~ R which maps  each f E ~l(p) on the real number (a(f . c)/at)(O). It is clear that for  every f, g E ~l(p) and every a, (3 E R,  c(O)( af + (3g) = ac(O)(f) + (3c(O)(g). (3)  The set of all vectors tangent at P to suitable paths through P is given  the structure of a real vector space by the following rules: For every  v, w belonging to that set, every f E g;l(p) and every a E R,  (v + w)(f) = v(f) + w(f),  (av)(f) = av(f). (4)  Endowed with this structure, the said set is called the tangent space  of M at P and is denoted by T p(M).  Let x be a chart at P E M, where M is, as before, as n-manifold. We  denote by Xi the ith 'coordinate function' Pi' x, where Pi is the ith  projection function of Rn (Pi assigns to each element (alo a2,' .. ,an)  of Rn its ith term ai).

(6)  It is therefore reasonable to write a/axilp for Ci(O). If aJ, ... ,a" are n  real numbers such that at least one of them, say ai' is not zero, the  linear combination Li ai a/ axilp is not identically zero, since it is equal  to (Xi at xi. The family (a/axilph"i"'" is therefore a free family of  vectors in T p(M). It can be shown that it is a basis of T p(M), the  canonical basis relative to chart x. T p(M) is therefore an n-dimen­ sional vector space. Associated with it are its dual, the cotangent  space T~(M) of real valued linear functions on T p(M) and the whole  array of spaces of covariant, contravariant and mixed tensors of all  orders which the reader will find defined in any textbook of linear  algebra. Hereafter, if v belongs to a tangent space of some manifold  M and f belongs to its dual space, we write (j. v) instead of f( v).  If M and M' are manifolds and ({): M -+ M' is Ck-differentiable at  P E M, (k > 0), (() determines a mapping of ~I«({)(P)) into ~I(p) which  we shall denote by (()~, and a mapping of Tp(M) into Tq>(p)(M') which  we shall denote by ({)*p. These mappings are defined for every f E  ~I«({)(P» and every vET p(M) by:  ({)~(j) = f· ({),  ({)*p(v) = v . ({)~. (7)  Consequently, (() *p( v), a vector tangent to M' at (()(P), maps a function  f in ~I«({)(P» on the same real number assigned by v, a vector tangent  to M at P, to the function f . ((), which belongs to ~l(p). If x is a chart  at P and y is a chart at (()(P),  (8)  Let c be a Ck-path in an n-manifold M, defined on a neighbourhood  of O. Equation (8) implies that if x is a chart at c(O), then </p><div id="pagenum"><p>(~I ) _ "" a(xi .

It will be readily seen that if M  and M' are manifolds and ip: M ..... M' is Ck -differentiable and c is a  Ck-path in M, ip . c is a Ck-path in M'. Let P = c(u) for some real  number u in the domain of c. Then ip*p(c(u» is the vector tangent to  ip . c at ip(P).  Let TM denote the collection of all vectors tangent to the n­ manifold M. The projection mapping 11': TM ..... M assigns to each  v E TM the point lTV at which v is tangent to M. The fibre of 11' over  each P E M is the tangent space T p(M). TM is endowed with a  canonical 2n-dimensional real valued Coo-atlas -and thus made into a  2n-manifold -by a simple device. Let A be an atlas of M. For each  chart x in Amax we define a 2n-dimensional chart i of TM as follows:  if v is an element of TM such that lTV E dom x,  (10)  Evidently dom i = 1T-1(dom x). It can be readily shown that the set of  charts {i I x E Amax} is an atlas of TM that makes 11' into a Coo_  differentiable mapping.  A triple (A, f, B), where A and B are manifolds and f: A ..... B is a  surjective Coo-differentiable mapping is called a fibre bundle over B. In  particular, (A, f, B) is a vector bundle over B if the fibre of f over  each b E B is a vector space which is mapped onto R" (for some fixed  positive integer n) by a linear isomorphism Lb, and each b E B has an  open neighbourhood U such that rl(U) is mapped diffeomorphically by  x Ho (f(x), L{(x)(x» onto U x R". It is clear that, under the stipulations of  the preceding paragraph, (TM, 11', M) is a vector bundle over M. We call  it the tangent bundle of M. The cotangent bundle of M and the infinite  array of its tensor bundles of all types and orders are built analogously  from the diverse linear spaces attached to each point of M (p.365).  A Ck-section over B in the vector bundle (A, f, B) is a Ck-differen­ tiable mapping g: B ..... A such that f . g is the identity mapping bHo b  of B onto itself. A Ck-section over the n-manifold M in the tangent  bundle (TM, 11', M) is called a Ck -vector field on M. A Ck -section over  M in its cotangent bundle is a Ck-covector field on M. More generally, </p><div id="pagenum"><p>a Ck-section over M in one of its tensor bundles is a Ck-tensor field </p></div><div id="pagenum"><p>APPENDIX 367 </p></div><p id="page">on M of the same type and order as its values. (Thus, a (j, k)-tensor  field on M assigns to each P E M a (j, k )-tensor on T p(M), i.e. a mixed  tensor of (j + k)th order, contravariant on the first j indices and  covariant on the last k indices, which maps suitable lists of cotangent  and tangent vectors at Pinto R.) A Ck-differentiable mapping of M  into R will be called a Ck-scalar field. If X is any Ck-field on M and  P E M, we usually write Xp instead of X(P) for the value of X at P. If  V and F are, respectively, a Ck-vector and a Ck-covector field on M,  the Ck-scalar field (F. V) is given by the equation:  (F. V)p = (Fp. Vp), (P EM). (11)  Let M be an n-manifold. We denote by S;k(M) the ring of Ck-scalar  fields on M (ring operations as in eqns (2». We denote by yk(M) the  collection of all Ck-vector fields on M. yk(M) is made into a module  over S;k(M) by the following rules: For every V, W in yk(M), every I  in S;k(M) and every P in M,  (V + W)p = Vp+ Wp,  (fV)p = IpVp. (12)  Each V E yk(M) determines a mapping V of S;k(M) into S;k-1(M). V  assigns to each Ck-scalar field I a Ck-1-scalar field VI, whose value at  P E M is given by  (13)  We usually write V for V. With this notation, if I and V are,  respectively, a scalar and a vector field on M, IV is a vector field on  M and VI is a scalar field on M. A similar notation is used for  co vector and tensor fields.  Let V be an open subset of the n-manifold M. We naturally regard  V as an n-manifold on its own right, whose maximal atlas includes the  restriction to V n dom x of each chart x in the maximal atlas of M.  With this structure, V is termed an open submanilold on M. Let  i: V -+ M be the canonical injection. It can be shown that for every  P E U, i*p is a linear isomorphism of Tp(V) onto Tp(M). We may  therefore identify T p(U) with T p(M) for each P E V and also TV, the  tangent bundle of the manifold U, with 17"-I(U), the inverse image of  U C M by the projection 17": TM -+ M. We shall henceforth consider  vector and tensor fields defined on open submanifolds of a given </p><div id="pagenum"><p>manifold. Thus, if x is a chart of M, a/axi : Pt-+ 818xi/p is a C~-vector </p></div><div id="pagenum"><p>368 APPENDIX </p></div><p id="page">field on dom x (1 ~ i ~ n). If V E 'Vk(M), then on dom x  ~ ·a V = .LJ Vx' -a i'  i X (14)  The scalar fields V Xi are called the components of V relative to chart  x.  Let U \ and U 2 be open submanifolds of n-manifold M. If V \ is a  COO-vector field on U\ and V2 is a COO-vector field on U2, the Lie  bracket [V I> V 2] of V \ and V 2 is the C' -vector field on U \ n U 2 defined  by  [V t. V 2]f = V \(V 21) -ViV tf), (15)  where f is any Coo-scalar field on U \ n U 2.  A real n-parameter Lie group is an n-manifold endowed with a  group structure such that the group product is a Coo-differentiable  mapping. It is often assumed that a Lie group is an analytic manifold  with analytic group product. Many important properties depend on  the further assumption that the natural topology of the underlying  manifold has a countable base; this is always true if the manifold is  connected. A complex Lie group is defined analogously. R n is a real  Lie group with the differentiable structure given on p.363 and the group  structure determined by vector addition.  Let G be a Lie group and M an n-manifold. G is said to act on M if  there is a Coo-differentiable surjection F: G x M ~ M such that for  every m EM and every g, h E G, F(g, F(h, m)) = F(gh, m). F is called  the action of G on M. G acts transitively on M if for every ml>  m2 EM there is agE G such that m2 = F(g, m\). G acts effectively on  M if F(g, m) = m for every m EM only if g is the neutral element of  G. If F is the action of G on M, there is associated with each g EGa  diffeomorphism fg: M ~ M whose value at each m E M is given by:  fg(m) = F(g, m). (16)  Let G' be the set {fg I g E G}. G' is obviously a group with group  product given by the composition of mappings. If G acts effectively  on M, the mapping J: fg~ g is plainly a group isomorphism of G' onto  G. If x is a chart of G, x . J is a chart of G'. With the differentiable  structure given by the collection of such charts, G' is a Lie group of  transformations of M. </p><div id="pagenum"><p>An example will illustrate the foregoing notions. Let M be an </p></div><div id="pagenum"><p>APPENDIX 369 </p></div><p id="page">n-manifold and let X be a COO-vector field on M. Let c be a COO-path in  M, defined on an open interval about zero, such that c(O) = P. If  i: = X . c on dom c, c is said to be an integral path of X with origin P.  There always is an open neighbourhood U of P and an open interval  about zero J such that each Q E U is the origin of an integral path of X  defined on J. Such path agrees on a neighbourhood of zero with every  other integral path of X with origin Q. Moreover, if Ct and C2 are  integral paths of X originating at the same point P E M, Ct and C2 agree  on the intersection of their domains. The union of the domains of the  integral paths of X with origin P is therefore an open interval Jp which  is the domain of the maximal integral path of X with origin P. If  Jp = R for every P E M, X is said to be a complete vector field on M. It  can be shown that X is complete if, and only if, there exists a  neighbourhood of zero that is part of the domain of each integral path  of X. If M is compact, X is necessarily complete. Let Ls: R ~ R be the  mapping u~ u + s. If Cp: Jp~ M is the maximal integral path of X  with origin P and if s E Jp , the path Cp • Ls is the maximal integral path  of X with origin cp(s) and its domain is L-s(Jp). Let D be the set  {(s, P) I P E M, s E Jp}. The mapping F: D~ M given by  F(s, P) = cp(s) (17)  is called the flow of vector field X. If (s + t, P) E D, F(s + t, P) =  F(s, F(t, P». Consequently, if X is complete, the flow of X is an action  on M of the Lie group R and each real number t determines a  diffeomorphism It of M onto M, defined by  ft(P) = F(t, P) = cp(t). (18)  {It I t E R} is the underlying set of a Lie group of transformations of  M, known as the one-parameter group generated by vector field X.  Let M be an n-manifold. By a field 01 M we shall hereafter mean a  Coo-scalar, vector or tensor field on an open submanifold of M. A  Coo-linear connection V on M assigns to every pair (X, Y) of vector  fields of M a vector field VxY on dom X ndom Y meeting the follow­ ing conditions: if I is any scalar field of M and X, Y and Z are any  vector fields of M, eqns. (19i)-(l9iv) hold wherever the expressions on  their left-hand sides are defined:  Vx(Y + Z) = VxY + VxZ,  Vx+yZ = VxZ + VyZ, (19i) </p><div id="pagenum"><p>(19ii) </p></div><div id="pagenum"><p>370 APPENDIX </p></div><p id="page">V,xY = IVxY,  VxfY = (xf)Y + IVxY. (19iii)  (l9iv)  VxY is called the covariant derivative 01 Y in the direction 01 X. The  linear connection V determines for every vector field Y of M a  (1,I)-tensor field VY on dom Y, which satisfies the following equation  for every vector field X and every covector field F on dom Y:  VY(F, X) = (F . VxY). (20)  VY is called the covariant derivative of Y.  Let x be a chart of M. For every pair of vector fields X and Y of M,  V x Y can be expressed, on the intersection of its domain with dom x,  as a linear combination of the vector fields iJ/ axi (1,.; i ,.; n). In  particular,  (21)  The rt are n3 scalar fields on dom x, called the components of the  linear connection V relative to chart x. They obviously suffice to  determine V on dom x. We now introduce n covector fields dxi on  dom x by stipulating that  / . a) . \ dx' . iJxI = 15;, (1"; i, j,.; n), (22)  where 8) is the constant scalar field equal to 1 if i = j and equal to 0  otherwise. The components of the covariant derivative VY relative to  chart x are the values of VY at (dxi, aJaxi). We denote them by yi;i.  The reader will verify that, writing yi for Y Xi,  (23)  Let c be a COO-path in M which maps a real interval (a, b) onto a  curve k. By a vector field on c we shall understand a vector field of M  that is defined on every point P E k. Two vector fields on c will be  said to be equivalent if they agree on k. If V is a vector field on c and  t E (a, b), V· c(t) = V crt)· We shall therefore write V c instead of V . c,  whenever V is a vector field on c. If V c = c on (a, b), V is said to be a  tangent field of c. Let X be a tangent field of c. A vector field Y is </p><div id="pagenum"><p>said to be parallel along c if Y is a vector field on c and (V x Y)c = 0 on </p></div><div id="pagenum"><p>APPENDIX 371 </p></div><p id="page">(a, b). By suitably restricting the domain of c, we can always find a  chart z defined on its entire range. On dom z, Y = ~i Y Zi at azi and  X = ~i XZi at azi. We shall write yi for Y Zi, etc. Noting that Xi . c =  (XZi) . C = XcZi and that Xc = C, we obtain:  azi.cayil a I = ~ ~ -a-t -azi c azr <  + ~ ~ ~ (yi . c) a(z;; c) (rt . c) -£.Ic  = ~ ~ ~ -£.1 < (a(Y;; c) + (yi . c) a(z;; c) (rt . c»),  (24)  where the rt are the components of the linear connection V relative  to z. Consequently, a vector field V is parallel along c if, and only if,  it is a vector field on c and V < = ~i Vi atazilc. where the functions  Vi: R -+ R are solutions of the system  dvk LL id(zi,c)(r k )-0 -+ v .. ' c -dt i i dt /1 (25)  The Vi are uniquely determined for each choice of initial values vi(to)  (to E dom c). This implies that for each vector v tangent to M at c(to)  (for each vET c(lo)(M» there is a unique equivalence class [V] of  vector fields on c, such that for any V E [V], V «10) = v and V is parallel  along c. The mapping V «10)1-+ V «I) (t E dom c) is a linear isomorphism  of T c(lo)(M) onto T c(t)(M) called parallel transport along c from c(to) to  c(t). If c has a tangent field which is parallel along c, c is said to be a  geodesic of V. Equation (25) implies that, if z is a chart at each point  of im c, c is a geodesic of M if, and only if,  d2(zk . c) ~ ~ dzi . C dzi . c (rk.. ) = 0  dt2 + "7 f dt dt /1 C , (26)  where rt are the components of the linear connection of M relative to  z.  We shall now define the curvature or Riemann tensor of an  n-manifold M endowed with a linear connection V. To each pair </p><div id="pagenum"><p>(X, Y) of vector fields of M we assign an operator R(X, Y), which </p></div><div id="pagenum"><p>372 APPENDIX </p></div><p id="page">maps vector fields on vector fields. If Z is a vector field of M, then on  dom X n dom Y ndom Z  (27)  R(X, Y)Z depends linearly on X, Y and Z. Its value at each point of  its domain depends only on the values of X, Y and Z at that point.  The curvature R of M is a (1,3)-tensor field such that, for any  covector field F and any vector fields X, Y and Z, on the intersection  of the domains of F, X, Y and Z,  R(F, Z, X, Y) = (F . R(X, Y)Z). (28)  If x is a chart of M, the n4 scalar fields Rhiik = R(dx\ ataxi, ataxi,  ataxk), defined on dom x, are the components of the curvature R  relative to x. Using eqns. (21), (27) and (28), one calculates that  (29)  If R is everywhere equal to 0, the connection V and the manifold  endowed with it are said to be flat.  The torsion of the manifold M endowed with the linear connection  V is a (1, 2)-tensor field on M which can be characterized thus. For  each pair (X, Y) of vector fields of M, T(X, Y) is the vector field on  dom X ndom Y given by  T(X, Y) = VxY -VyX -[X, Y]. (30)  Let X, Y be two vector fields of M and let F be a covector field of M.  The torsion T assigns to the triple (F, X, Y) the scalar field  (F . T(X, Y» wherever the latter is defined. The components of T  relative to a chart x of M are given by  . / . ( a a)) . . Tjk = \ dx' . T ail' ax" = rjk -fki' (31)  where the rjk are the components of the linear connection V relative  to x. If T vanishes everywhere, V is said to be torsion-free. It follows  from eqns. (26) and (31) that a torsion-free linear connection is fully  determined if its geodesics are given.  Let M be an n-manifold. A semi-Riemannian C"'-metric g on M is  a (O,2)-tensor field on M which is (i) symmetric and (ii) non­</p><div id="pagenum"><p>degenerate. g assigns to every P E M a scalar product gp on T p(M). Let </p></div><div id="pagenum"><p>APPENDIX 373 </p></div><p id="page">V and W be vector fields of M. g(V, W) denotes the scalar field  P~gp(Vp, Wp), defined on dom V ndom W. (i) means that g(V, W) =  g(W, V) irrespective of the choice of V and W; (ii) means that for  each P EM, g(V, W)p = 0 for every vector field W defined on a  neighbourhood of P if, and only if, V p is the vector 0 (in T p(M».  The components of the metric g relative to a chart x of M are given  by  (32)  Since g is non-degenerate, the matrix of the gi; is non-singular on  dom x. There exists therefore a unique (2, O)-tensor field on M, whose  components gi; relative to the chart x are given by  (33)  The signature of the metric g at a point P E dom x is the number of  positive, minus the number of negative, eigenvalues of the matrix  [gj;(P)]. Since g is continuous and non-degenerate, its signature is  constant on M. We denote it by sg(g). If sg(g) = n, g is said to be a  Riemannian metric and (M, g) is called a Riemannian manifold. The  most familiar example of a Riemannian metric is the Euclidean metric  {j on R". Its components relative to the identity chart x: u ~ u are  given by  (a a) _ j _ {I if i = j,  {j ax" ax; -{j; -0 ifi'l j. (34)  A metric g with signature sg(g) = n -2 is called a Lorentz metric.  Einstein's theory of relativity conceives physical spacetime as a  4-dimensional real manifold endowed with a Lorentz metric.  If g is a semi-Riemannian metric on the n-manifold M there is a  unique torsion-free linear connection V on M that satisfies the condi- tion  Vg=O. (35)  This connection is said to be the only linear connection compatible  with g and is called the Levi-Civita connection of g. Let x be a chart  of M and let gij and rjk stand, respectively, for the components of g  and yo relative to x. It can be shown that </p><div id="pagenum"><p>(36) </p></div><div id="pagenum"><p>374 APPENDIX </p></div><p id="page">The components r~ of the Levi-Civita connection of a semi-Rieman­ nian metric g on a manifold M, relative to a chart of M, are thus equal  to the Christoffel symbols of the second kind Lhj} defined on p.94  (eqn.

If Szabo is right we ought to hail  Parmenides of Elea, rather than Thales or Pythagoras, as the true father of scientific  mathematics. But, as it often happens in philology, Szabo's arguments are not altogether  convincing. See his Anfiinge der griechischen Mathematik (1969), pp.243-293, etc.,  Szabo (1964) presents some of Szabo's ideas in English.  6 See Becker (1934), Reidemeister (1940), Van der Waerden (1947{49). Strictly speak­ ing, the word number (arithmos) means in Greek an integer greater than one. Yet the  propositions proved of numbers generally hold good also if the unit (monas) is counted  as a number. Hereafter, when dealing with Greek mathematics, we shall mean by  number a positive integer.  7 Heath, EE, Vol.II, p.414.  8 Plato, Respub., 511"1; cf. 526"6.  9 Van der Waerden, SA, p.I44.  10 According to the numbering of the Basel edition of 1533.

The numbers are not found in the manuscript and are  included for reference. Postulate 5 is analysed in Section 2. 1. l.  24 It says that the intersection of two lines exists when certain conditions are fulfilled.  25 Aristotle, Phys., Book III, Chapter 6.  26 Zeuthen (1896), who interpreted all five postulates as existential statements, main­ tained that the fourth really means that there is a unique straight line of which a given  segment is a part, or, in other words. that the construction postulated by the second  aitema can be unambiguously carried out. O. Becker (1959) takes the sounder view that  all the constructions postulated by the first three aitemata are required by these to be  unambiguous (this is an essential part of their meaning). Becker remarks that Postulate  4 can then be proved by means of Postulates 1 and 2. He concludes that Postulate 4  was not really meant as a postulate or unproved assumption, but as a reminder that had  to be inserted before Postulate 5 because this speaks of "two right angles" as if it were  a perfectly definite quantity.  27 'HL'l"iJu-3w was rendered above as "let it be postulated". It is the third person singular  aorist imperative of the verb a~TEOj.L(H, that in ordinary Greek means 'to ask for one's  own', 'to claim', 'to beg'.

If, like Aristotle, we assign to each planet its </p><div id="pagenum"><p>full CaIlippean model, we must end up with 61 spheres, because every planet will have </p></div><div id="pagenum"><p>NOTES TO CHAPTER 1 377 </p></div><p id="page">a sphere of its own that rotates about the North-South axis with the same angular  velocity as the fixed stars, and this rotation must be compensated by the rotation of an  additional sphere before it is again introduced with the next planet. Aristotle over­ looked this fact and counted only 55 spheres (loc. cit., 1075"11). Seven of the 55 rotate  like the first (i.e., like the fixed stars). Since these seven rotations have none to counter  them, the Aristotelian moon must rise in the East seven times a day. Apparently  nobody noticed this before Norwood Russell Hanson (Constellations and Conjectures,  pp.66-80). Earlier scholars had pointed out that six spheres were dispensable, but none  said that, unless their motions were neutralized (by suppressing them or by adding new  spheres), the lower planets would be going too fast.  44 Aristotle, Eth.

Let this plane be represented  by the complex plane, with the centre of the earth at the origin. An arbitrary planetary  trajectory on that plane will be represented by a continuous periodic function z = f(t).  Uniform circular motion about the point designated by the complex number k is  represented by the function z' = k + a exp(ibt) (where a and b are real numbers  depending on the radius of the circle and the angular velocity of the motion).  Consequently, the position at time t of a body moving with nth degree uniform  geocentric epicyclical motion is given by z· = al exp(iblt) + ... + a. exp{ib.t). By a  suitable choice of n and of the 2n constants aj, bj, the difference Iz -z"1 can be made to  remain less than any assigned positive real number.  so Derek J. de S. Price (1959), p.21O. Pre-Keplerian astronomy never attained the  optimal accuracy indicated on p.20; Price's calculations show, however, that its failings  were due to a wrong choice of parameters rather than to the inadequacy of the  epicyclic models.

It is hard to imagine what the eyes -even if we take them to be the  "eyes of the mind" -can see in pure, i.e. sensation-free, intuition, unless the latter is  determined by concepts. Nevertheless, Kant's view of geometrical proof was incredibly  popular among philosophers throughout the 19th century (see, e.g., Schopenhauer,  WW, VoLVII, pp.62-67; VoLII, pp.82-99). J. Hintikka has recently tried to make sense  of it by drawing a parallel between Kant's appeal to "singular intuition" and the use of  existential instantiation, which we now know to be indispensable in most mathematical  demonstrations. But existential instantiation, far from being the opposite of "thinking  an object by means of a universal concept", presupposes a concept with which the  proposed instance must exactly agree.

Let m lie on plane n. There are infinitely many pairs «(" (2)  of disjoint open half-planes of n, such that ai C (i' Let m' be the common boundary of  one such pair; m' is then a straight line joining points of n which lie on either side of m  and yet m' does not meet m. (If the intersection of m and m' were not empty it would  contain a point belonging to al or to a2 but not lying between any two points of its own  class; this contradicts the above characterization of al and a2.) Descartes would  doubtless have judged this result incompatible with the continuity of line m.  % A linear order on a set S is determined by a binary relation R such that, if x, y and z  are any three elements of S, the following conditions are fulfilled: (i) either Rxy or Ryx  (R is universal); (ii) Rxy precludes Ryx (R is antisymmetric); (iii) if Rxy and Ryz, then  Rxz (R is transitive). If R determines a linear order one usually writes 'x < y' instead  of Rxy (read: 'x precedes y' or 'y follows x'). The reader should verify that conditions  (i), (ii) and (iii) on page 35 determine a linear ordering of the points of m, and that this  order is preserved whenever a positive segment O'E' is substituted for OE and is  merely reversed whenever OE is replaced by a negative segment.  97 One should bear in mind that the field structure of I depends on the choice of a  segment OE and of a direction on each Euclidean line.  CHAPTER 2. NON-EUCLIDEAN GEOMETRIES  2.1 Parallels  1 Heath, EE, YoU, p.155.  2 Imre T6th (1966/7) has classed and analysed numerous passages in the Corpus  Aristotelicum allusive to a pre-Euclidean discussion of parallels and related  matters which, he claims, established that: (i) the existence of a parallel to a  given line through a point outside it can be proved by construction; (ii) alleged direct  proofs of the uniqueness of the said parallel are question-begging; (iii) if the parallel to  a given line through a point outside it is not unique, the three interior angles of a  triangle are not equal to 11'; (iv) it can be proved by reductio ad absurdum that they are  not greater than 11' (Aristotle repeatedly mentions the proof of this statement as a  familiar example of apagogic proof); (v) attempts to prove that they are not less than 11' </p><div id="pagenum"><p>are inconclusive (something never mentioned by Aristotle but which should be obvious </p></div><div id="pagenum"><p>380 NOTES TO CHAPTER 2 </p></div><p id="page">from the fact that Euclid included Postulate 5 among the unproved assumptions of  geometry). If T6th is right, the debate on Postulate 5 from the 1st century B.C. to the  19th century originated in ignorance or lack of understanding of the geometrical  tradition leading up to Euclid. Although my pedestrian imagination is not always able to  follow T6th's in its sometimes frenzied flight, I believe that his work deserves careful  study.  3 Proclus, Comm., ed.

All I find in the passages mentioned by  Daniels (see Reid, PW, YoU, pp.142-153) is a discussion of the geometric structure of  the visual field, which, according to Reid, is spherical. Reid's approach is certainly  original, but he has not made a contribution to geometry. The geometry of the sphere  which he sees embodied in his "geometry of visibles" (Reid, PW, YoU, pp.147ff.) was  familiar to Euclid and was used profusely in ancient astronomy. There is in Reid's book  no suggestion that the characteristic properties of the sphere (e.g. that straightest lines </p><div id="pagenum"><p>meet twice) might also be realized in a three-dimensional space.

This text of 1819 should establish that there is no truth in  the story that Gauss undertook geodetic measurements at mounts Brocken, Hohehagen  and Inselsberg in order to decide experimentally whether Euclid's geometry was true of  physical space. The ultimate source of this rather naive tale appears to be a passage in  W. Sartorius von Waltershausen's memoir Gauss zum Gediichtnis (1856) p.80 (quoted  in Gauss, WW, Vo1.8, p.267). But Sartorius says only that Gauss maintained that "we  know from experience, e.g. from the angles of the triangle Brocken, Hohehagen,  Inselberg, that [Postulate 5] is approximately correct". Sartorius does not say that  Gauss, who had indeed measured that triangle in the course of his geodetical work in  the early 1820's, did it with the aim of testing Euclidean geometry. From the above  quotation we learn that Gauss knew already in 1819 that it would be hard to test it even  on an astronomical scale. Let me add, by the way, that in his Disquisitiones generales  circa superficies curvas (1827) Gauss himself mentions the Hohehagen-Brocken­ Inselsberg triangle, though not as a plane triangle differing imperceptibly from a  Euclidean triangle, but as a terrestrial triangle which differs so little from a spherical  triangle, that we cannot determine from it, let alone from a smaller such triangle, the  difference between a perfect sphere and the actual shape of the earth.

Unlimited  differentiability is required in order to avoid qualifications that would distract the  reader from the conceptual issues which are our concern. A more general charac­ terization of paths is given in the Appendix, p.363. A mapping is said to be injective if it  assigns distinct values to distinct arguments. (See p.359.)  4 The ith projection function on Rn maps each ordered n-tuple of real numbers on its  ith member.  5 Such a convention may be set as follows: CI(t) = 'Nt, b) and C2(t) = <I>(a, t) describe  curves on <I>«() meeting at <I>(a, b) = P; c;(a) = HI and c2(b) = H2 are the tangential  images of these curves at P. We choose Qi as the normal image of <I>«() at P if, and  only if, whenever the right thumb and right forefinger point, respectively, from 0  toward HI and from 0 toward H2, the right middle finger can be made to point toward  Qi' This convention clearly determines our choice of Qi at each point P.  6 That is, by the area of n«() if the "part of a curved surface" is denoted by <I>«().  7 Gauss, GI, pp.9f. (§6).  8 A rational reconstruction of Gauss' definition of the (local) curvature of a surface is  furnished by the theory of differential manifolds. (See Appendix, pp.36Iff.) Our surface  <I>«() and the unit sphere can both be conceived as 2-manifolds. n is then a differenti­ able mapping of the former into the latter. Consequently, n determines a mapping n. of  the tangent bundle over <l>«() into the tangent bundle over the unit sphere such that, if c  is any path in <l>«() and CI denotes the path n . c, n.c = CI' n also determines a mapping  n* of each bundle of (0, k) tensor fields on the unit sphere into the bundle of  (0, k)-tensor fields on <l>«(), such that, for any (0, k)-tensor field T on the former  and any k-tuple (v" ... , vd of vector fields on the latter, n*T(v" ... , vd =  T(n.v" ... , n*vd. The area of a region U of a 2-manifold M is measured by integrating  over U a 2-differential form (i.e.' an alternating (0,2)-tensor field) on M, called the  surface element of M. Let IP and w be the surface elements of <l>«) and of the unit  sphere, respectively. Then, at any point P in <1>(0, IPp and (n*w)p both belong to the  one-dimensional vector space of alternating (0, 2)-tensors on the tangent space of <I>«()  at P, so that their quotient exists and is a real number, just as in Gauss' definition. The  mapping p ...... IPp/(n*w)p is then a scalar field on <I>«(), the Gaussian curvature of the  surface. A more straightforward vindication of Gauss' definition can be achieved within  the theory of formal differential geometry currently being developed by Kock, Wraith  and Reyes. (On this theory, see, for example, A. Kock and G.E. Reyes (1977).)  9 An arc s in <l>(O joining two points A and B is said to be an arc of shortest length or a  shortest arc if its length is less than or equal to that of any other arc joining A and B which  is contained in a (suitably narrow) strip of <1>(0 covering s.  10 Surfaces of constant negative curvature had been studied by Ferdinand Minding </p><div id="pagenum"><p>(1839, 1840) in two papers published in the same journal (Crelle's I. fiir die reine u. </p></div><div id="pagenum"><p>NOTES TO CHAPTER 2 383 </p></div><p id="page">angewandte Mathematik) that had printed Lobachevsky's "Geometrie imaginaire" in  1837.

The term 'intrinsic geometry'  seems quite appropriate to denote this set of properties. This concept of an intrinsic  geometry ought not to be confused with Adolf Griinbaum's notion of an "intrinsic  metric". (see Griinbaum, PPST, pp.50lf.).  15 On arcs of shortest length see above, Note 9. Solutions of the differential equations  set up by Gauss are paths in 4>(C) which are known as geodesics; their ranges are called  geodetic arcs. It can be shown that if two points A, B on 4>({) can be joined by a  shortest arc, that arc is a geodetic arc; but it is not necessarily the only geodetic arc  joining A and B. It can also happen that no shortest arc joins A and B, even though  they are joined by a geodetic arc; e.g. if 4>({) is a punctured sphere and A and B lie on a  punctured meridian on the same hemisphere as but on opposite sides of the excised  point.  16 Of course, in the induced geometry, the 'shortest' arc joining two points A and B of  Q is not necessarily straight: it is the qt-image of the shortest arc joining qt-I(A) and  qt-I(B) on S. Also a 'right' angle is not necessarily equal to its adjacent angle, unless qt  is conformal, i.e. angle-preserving.  11 See e.g. Poincare, VS, p.58. Compare Hausdorff (1904), pp.I4-17.  18 The main advances in this development were made by Riemann himself (in his  prize-essay of 1861; see Riemann, WW, pp.401-404), Beltrami (1868/69), Christoffel  (1869), Schur (1886), Ricci and Levi-Civita (1901), Levi-Civita (1917), Weyl (1918),  Cartan (see his LGER; references to some of his original papers are given in Cartan,  ERS), Ehresmann (1950) and Koszul (reported in Nomizu (1954), p.35, n.2).  19 See the illuminating commentary on Riemann's lecture in Spivak, ClOO, VoLlI,  from which I draw abundantly in what follows.  20 Riemann, H, p.8.  21 Riemann, H, p.8. Experience could not help us to discover the metrical properties  that single out space among threefold extended quantities if space were indeterminate  in this regard or metrically "amorphous". For this reason, I cannot agree with Adolf  Griinbaum's reading of Riemann (PPST, pp.8ff.) nor can I regard the latter as a  forerunner of the former's conventionalist philosophy of space and geometry. It is one  thing to maintain that the generic concept of which our physical space is a species does  not involve a definite metric and quite another to hold that such a metric is not a  structural property of physical space. In a much quoted passage, Riemann (H, p.23)  asserted that if physical space is a continuous manifold, its metric relations cannot be  derived from the mere conception of this manifold as such, and their foundation must  be sought in the nature of the physical forces that keep the manifold together. This does  not imply that the metric of physical space is conventional but, on the contrary, that it  is natural and hence cannot be known a priori. </p><div id="pagenum"><p>22 Riemann, H, p.8. </p></div><div id="pagenum"><p>384 NOTES TO CHAPTER 2 </p></div><p id="page">23 Points of a continuous "manifold" are therefore conceived by Riemann as the  specifications of a genus (Bestimmungsweisen eines allgemeinen Begriffs); each point of  a "manifold" differs from every other point as a species from another -each point  possesses, so to speak, the individuality of an angel. This is indeed a far cry from the  lack of differentiation traditionally ascribed to the points of space.  24 He gives two examples, however: the "manifold" of functions defined on a given  domain, and the possible figures of a closed region in space.  25 I mean by dom I the domain of f.

See also Appendix, p.363.  28 A differentiable mapping I of a differentiable manifold into another is said to be an  imbedding if (i) I maps its domain homeomorphic ally onto its range and (ii) at each  point P in dom I, the mapping I *p maps its domain (i.e. the tangent space at P)  isomorphically onto its range. On the tangent bundle of a manifold, see Appendix,  p.366.  29 Riemann. H, p.9.  30 Such is the case with time intervals, unless the intervals compared are one a part of  the other, the trivial case that Riemann explicitly excludes from his considerations.  31 An arc is the range of a path defined on a closed interval. See Appendix. p.363.  32 The straight segment joining x = (x" ... ,x.) and Y = (YI, ... ,Y.) in R' is the set of  all points z = (ZI,' ..• z.) that satisfy the equations (Xi -Zi) = k(Xi -Yi) (I.:;; i.:;; n), for  some positive real number k < I.  33 The nonn of a vector space V assigns to each v E V a non-negative real number Ilvll.  such that (i) Ilvll = 0 if and only if v is the zero vector of V; (ii) Ilv + wll.:;; Ilvll + Ilwll for  every v, wE V; (iii) Ilavll = lalllvil for every a E R and every v E V.  34 It is essential the arc be smooth, i.e. that it be the range of a differentiable mapping  (at least of class el) of an interval of R into our manifold. As noted by Killing (EGG,  Vol.II, p.9), not every line can be measured by any other line, by Riemann's methods, if  by line we understand the range of a continuous mapping of a real interval into the  manifold.  3l That is, the tangent space of the one-dimensional submanifold c«a, b» at point c(s).  This sub manifold does not include the points c(a) and c(b). These are included  however in the range of an extension of c. See p.363.  36 A metric space is a pair (S, d), where S is a set and d is a mapping of S x S into R  such that for any x, y, z E S (i) d(x, x) = 0; (ii) d(x. y) > 0 whenever x'" Y; (iii) d(x, y) =  dey, x), and (iv) d(x, Y) + dey, z) "" d(x, z). d is called the distance function; d(x, y), the  distance between x and y.  37 Appendix, p.365.  l8 The covariant tensor field I-' and the vector fields (a/axi).  39 The expressions on the left-hand side of equations (5) are known as the Christoffel  symbols of the first and the second kind, respectively.

But R.S. Kulkarni (1970)  has shown that if n > 3, Riemann's claim is true, except in a special family of cases. To  be more precise, let us say that two R-manifolds M and M' are isocurved if there exists  a diffeomorphism !: M ---> M' such that, for every P E M and every two-dimensional  subspace ex of Tp(M), k(ex) = k(f*p(a».

Riemann adds: "Consequently in the manifolds with constant  curvature, figures may be placed in any way we choose."  l2 Riemann's short discussion of surfaces of positive constant curvature in Section  2.2.5 plus an important remark in Section 3.1.2 regarding the finiteness of three­ dimensional manifolds of constant positive curvature are, as far as I can see, the only  justification for giving the name "Riemann geometry" to the intrinsic geometry of a  sphere. Riemann geometry, in this sense, should not be confused with Riemannian  geometry, or the general theory of R-manifolds. Since the latter, due to its importance  and generality, is a better candidate for preserving and honouring the name of its  creator, I recommend against the use of "Riemann geometry" for conveying the  former sense.

Grassmann explains that non-Euclidean geometries easily fit in his general theory of  extension because three-dimensional non-Euclidean spaces may be regarded as hyper­ surfaces of a "region" of higher level, i.e. of a vector space of more than three  dimensions (Grassmann, WW. I.1, pp.293f.). This is certainly true. Moreover every  connected n-dimensional differentiable manifold can be imbedded into R2"+1 (Whitney  (1936». However this does not imply that the theory of differentiable manifolds can be  absorbed by the theory of vector spaces -as Grassmann seems to believe -for a  manifold can always be regarded as a submanifold but is not usually a subspace of a  vector space of higher dimension.  2.3 Projective Geometry and Projective Metrics  I It is true that projective geometry deals with cross-ratio. which may be defined as a  function of the distance between four points on a line. or of the angles between four  coplanar lines through a point. But in Sections 2.3.5 and 2.3.10 we shall show how this  form of dependence of projective geometry on (Euclidean) metrics can be avoided.  2 For greater precision. let a be a plane angle at P and let a' be the angle opposite to a. </p><div id="pagenum"><p>We call a Ua' a double angle at P. Let qa denote the set of all meets of q with lines </p></div><div id="pagenum"><p>NOTES TO CHAPTER 2 387 </p></div><p id="page">through P that lie within the double angle a Ua'. Then the set {qa I a Ua' is a double  angle at P} is a base of a topology on q (regarded as the set of its meets). This is the  topology induced on q by a flat pencil through a point outside it. It does not depend on the  choice of that point (P in the preceding discussion). (On topologies, see Appendix,  pp.360f.)  3 Relative to the topology defined in Note 2.  • Appendix, p.361.  S Appendix, p.361.  6 Take the weakest topology that makes every coUineation into a homeomorphism. (A  collineation is a bijective mapping of projective space onto itself that maps collinear  points onto collinear points.)  7 Let al>' .. ,a. be elements of a vector space over field F (or, more generally, of a  module over ring F). al> ... , a. are said to be linearly dependent if there are elements  kl> ... ,k. in F, not all equal to zero, such that klal + ... + k.a. = O. (In the text above,  regard Rl as a vector space over R.)  8 A more satisfactory approach to complex projective geometry, which does not  depend, like ours, on numerical representations, was proposed by von Staudt in 1856.  See Staudt, BGL, pp.76ff.; Uiroth (1875). The significance of von Staudt's proposal in  the history of mathematics is clearly brought out by Freudenthal (1974).  8a Solutions exist unless all, its cofactor All and the determinant lai;1 all have the same  sign. If that condition is fulfilled the polarity is elliptic.  9 As an immediate corollary of the stated characteristic of conics let us mention that a  collineation always maps a conic onto a conic. Let I be a collineation and , a conic  which is the locus of self-conjugate points under a polarity g; then Igrl is also a  polarity and its locus of self -conjugate points is 1(').  10 That is, if none of them can be represented by a set of complex homogeneous  coordinates (aj + hi) such that hj = 0 for j = 1,2,3.  II An interesting exception occurs if the left-hand side of the linear equation is a factor  of the left-hand side of the quadratic equation. In that case, the conic represented by  the latter is a degenerate one composed of two lines, one of which is the one given by  the linear equation. Trivial exceptions occur if any of the left-hand sides is identically  zero.  12 But of course these "circles," in [Jl2 are not the loci of points equidistant from a given  point. We have, as yet, no concept of distance in our projective plane.  Il Lie, VCG, pp.l3Of., 216f.  14 Lie, VCG, pp.I3lff. By 'reducible' I mean that its value can be calculated from the  value of the cross-ratio (thus. the square or cube of the cross-ratio are reducible to the  cross-ratio. etc.).

Instead of the natural logarithm he  used the cyclometric function arc cos. Cayley welcomed Klein's substitution of a  logarithmic function for his cyclometric function as "a great improvement, for we at  once see that the fundamental relation dist(PQ) + dist(QR) = dist(PR), is satisfied."  (Cayley, CP, Vol.lI, p.604). A clear sketch of Cayley's theory is given in Kline, MT,  pp.907-909.  23 Cayley, CP, Vol.lI, p.592.  24 By a real conic, I mean a conic some of whose points are real, i.e. such that they can  be represented by a set of homogeneous coordinates with their imaginary part equal to  zero (see Note 10).  2S See Klein (1871) and Klein, VNG, Chapters VI and VII.  26 They are: two real lines meeting at a real point, two conjugate imaginary lines  meeting at a real point; one real line with two distinguished real points on it, one real  line with two distinguished conjugate imaginary points on it (the only case considered  by Klein in 1871), and one real line with one distinguished point on it.

Angle measure is  defined analogously.  34 Beltrami, OM, VoU, p.375.  3S Beltrami confirms this view in his paper of 1869 where he develops the general  theory of n-dimensional spaces of constant curvature. "Every concept of non-Eucli­ dean [BLJ geometry finds a perfect equivalent in the geometry of the space of constant  negative curvature. It should be observed, however, that, while the concepts belonging  to simple planimetry receive in this manner a true and proper interpretation, since they  turn out to be constructible upon a real surface, those which embrace three dimensions  will only admit an analytical representation, because the space in which such a  representation could materialize (verrebbe a concretarsi) is different from that to which  we generally give that name."

See Fig. 15 on p.l37.  ~ There is a four-page introduction in which Klein describes the contents and back­ ground of the two parts of his article and makes some remarks on the general aim of  investigations concerning non-Euclidean geometry. Their aim is not "decision on the  validity of the axiom of parallels"; their only concern is with the question" whether the  axiom of paralleLs is a mathematical consequence of the other axioms listed by Euclid"  (Klein, 1873, p.1I3). Other benefits reaped from such investigations are (i) "enlarging  of the circle of our mathematical concepts" and (ii) "our being provided with material  for jUdging the necessity of our familiar geometrical representations and modifying  them in the appropriate way in case this should turn out to be desirable"; therein lies  "the significance of these investigations for physics". (Klein (1873), p.1I4.)  41 Klein (1873), p.1I6.  42 See Appendix, p.362.  43 Klein, Vergleichende Betrachtungen iJber neuere geometrische Forschungen,  Erlangen: A. Diichert, 1872. This is Klein's celebrated Erlangen Programme. I shall  quote from the revised edition of 1893, hereafter designated by EP. A note in Klein  (1873), p.121, suggests that this paper was written before the Programme, though the  latter appeared first.  44 Readers unfamiliar with the concept of a group ought to read carefully the  definitions given in the Appendix, p.360.  4' Strictly speaking, de is not defined on any pair (x, y) E (~c x ~~) such that x or y lies on  i:. We pointed this out above for n = 2. If i: is degenerate it may happen that de is invariant  not under the group of collineations that map i: onto itself, but only under a proper  subgroup of that group.  46 The reader should observe that when we transfer to M' the G-geometry of M via an  arbitrary bijection f, we ignore all structure that M' might possess on its own. Disregard  of this point has often caused. confusion. Thus, it is well known that R2 can be mapped  bijectively onto R (Cantor, GA, pp.119-133). E. Stenius mentions this fact to prove that  we can define ordinary plane geometry on a line. But such a statement is misleading.  We can certainly do as he says, but only on the condition that we forget that the line is  a one-dimensional topological space and that we treat it as an abstract set (with the  power of the continuum). When we define plane geometry on this set we endow it with  the structure of a two-dimensional topological space. See Stenius, Critical Essays, p.54.  47 Klein (1873), p.123.

A similar proof was sent to Klein "y  Liiroth. Let us recall that, if p, q, rand s are four different lines of a flat pencil, p and q  are said to separate rand s if p is contained in one of the two pairs of vertically  opposite angles formed by rand s, and q is contained in the other. Cf. pAll, n.44.  55 The lines of net (uvw) fall into two classes: those which have been assigned a  rational number whose absolute value is less than 7[, and those which have been  assigned a rational number whose absolute value is greater than 'IT. No pair of lines in  the first class is separated by a pair of lines in the second class. There is a unique line in  pencil X which, together with the line labelled 00, separates the remaining lines of one class  from the remaining lines of the other class. This line cannot be associated with a rational  number and consequently does not belong to (uvw).  56 Take, for example the last case we mentioned. Point 0 is mapped on [0,0, IJ; point  Y on [s, t, IJ. Every triple of the class [s, t, OJ is a solution of the equation  Consequently, this class lies on the join of [0,0, IJ and [s, t, IJ.

He writes:  "The straight line of ordinary intuition (der gewohnlichen Anschauung) contains only  one infinitely distant point. We can approach this point from either side without ever  reaching it." (Klein (1871), p.593).  62 Clifford explained his discovery in a lecture that Klein attended in 1873. The text of  this lecture was never published but Klein reconstructed its mathematical contents in  Part I of his paper of 1890. A very clear account of Clifford's discovery and its  implications is given in Klein, VNG, pp.233-238, 241-249, 254-270. There is a short  description in Klein (1897), pp.591-593.

I state it separately in order to bring out the  increasingly restrictive character of these hypotheses.

S Helmholtz (1870), G, p.19.  6 Helmholtz (1868), G, p.60.  6a Obviously Helmholtz has no qualms about the truth of RI, which he probably  regarded as an analysis of the meaning of "space".  7 See above, p.lOO. A proof was given by Lipschitz (1870).  • Helmholtz (1866), pp.I99, 201; (1868), G, pp.36, 60; (1870), G, p.29. Helmholtz is so  convinced of the necessity of this requirement that he does not even perceive that  Riemann was of another mind. He simply overlooks the fact that Riemann, who shared  with him the assumption that physical measurement involves superposition of physical  magnitudes, inferred from this assumption, not that every body must be superposable  with every other body, but that every line must be measurable by -and to this end  totally or partially superposable with -every other line (p.91). We might thus say that  Riemann's physical geometry requires ideally thin, perfectly ftexible and inextensible  strings, but does not require, like that of Helmholtz, absolutely rigid bodies.  9 Helmholtz (1870), G, p.29.  10 See p.177.

The  possibility of quantitative comparisons is not a consequence of the general form of  extendedness, since it presupposes the existence of rigid bodies. A liquid mathemati­ cian living in a liquid world cannot, according to Helmholtz, develop a geometry, but he  could very well share our general form of spatial intuition.  26 Helmholtz, G, p.29; PSL, p.244.  27 Helmholtz, G, p.17; PSL, p.234. Formerly, he had tried to make this intuitively clear  in the light of the two-dimensional case. In that context, he introduces a two­ dimensional country inhabited by two-dimensional rational beings who "have not the  power of perceiving anything outside" the surface they live on, but have, upon it,  "perceptions similar to ours"! (Helmholtz, G, p.8; PSL, p.227). These  beings will supposedly develop the intrinsic geometry of their country. But if they  happen to live, say, upon an egg, they will be unable to build transportable rigid figures  and, consequently, according to Helmholtz, they will be incapable of defining a  geometry. Though Helmholtz introduces the example of an egg, he does not draw the  latter consequence; had he drawn it, it would probably have shocked him out of his  operationist bias, for he certainly knew that one can define with Gaussian methods the  intrinsic geometry of an egg-like surface. Let us remark that the country of F1atlaQ.d is  used by Helmholtz merely as a didactic prop, and oUght not to be taken too seriously.  Greater significance must be attributed to the Helmholtzian country we mentioned on  p.165 viz. Through-the-Convex-Looking-G1ass.  28 Helmholtz (1866), p.l97; cf. Helmholtz (lR68), G, pp.32f.  29 Helmholtz (G, pp.29f.; PSL, p.245) says "transcendental in Kant's sense".

We prove that L. is injective:  L.(m) = L.(n)-+ leg, m) = leg, n)-+ {(g-I, leg, m» = {(g-I, leg, n»-+ fee, m) = fee, n)-+  m = n. (Read '-+' as 'implies that'.)  39 This is now the usual definition of transitive action. But Lie's own definition, in  modern terms, would read as follows: G acts transitively on M if there is an open  subset M' C M such that, for every pair x, y in M', there is agE G with gx = y (see Lie,  TT, YoU, p.212).  40 This is said of R3 in Lie (1890), p.20. See also Lie, IT, YoU, p.572.  41 Lie, IT, VoLlIl, pp.385, 387, etc. Observe that by fixing once and for all the nature  of the space R. on which his groups are allowed to act, Lie was able to ignore the  complications that arise from considering the action of groups on manifolds of diverse  global topologies.  42 This statement of the problem is paraphrased from Lie, TT, VoLIII, p.397. Lie says,  however, that the sought for properties should distinguish the three groups mentioned  above from "all other possible groups of motions of a number-manifold (Zahlen­ mannig{altigkeit)". In the light of Lie's actual performance I have judged it appropriate  to broaden "groups of motions" to "groups of analytic transformations", while nar­ rowing down "eine Zahlenmannigfaltigkeit" to ~~. It is indeed not easy to say what Lie  (or Engel) understands by "eine Zahlenmannigfaltigkeit". In TT, Vol. III, p.394, this  expression is introduced by saying that, in his lecture of 1854, "Riemann-let all his  research be guided by the proposition that space is a Zahlenmannig{altigkeit, so that the  points of space can be determined by coordinates." It might seem, therefore, that a  Zahlenmannig{altigkeit is for Lie any n-dimensional, real or complex, presumably  analytic, differentiable manifold. This is somehow confirmed by the fact that Lie calls  any regular submanifold of R~ "eine Mannigfaltigkeit des R." (Lie, IT, YoU, p.133).  On the other hand, there is no doubt that "the space R." discussed in the subsequent  chapters on Helmholtz's problem and the foundations of geometry is ~~, ~', or an  open subset of either. This is very clearly brought out in Lie's own statement of some of  his results in Lie (1890), pp.303f., 308, 312. Unfortunately, the text of TT, edited by  Engel, is not so careful on such conceptual matters.  43 The first of these, in Lie, TT, VoLIII, pp.452f., is Lie's "translation" of Helmholtz's  axioms into group-theoretical language. Lie criticizes Helmholtz's own deductions from  his axioms because Helmholtz "nimmt [ ... J stilIschweigend und ohne ein Wort der  Begriindung an, dass alle seine Axiome, die er iiber die nach Festhaltung eines Punktes  noch mogiichen Bewegungen aufgestellt hat, auch auf die Punkte anwendbar bleiben,  die dem festen Punkte unendlich benachbart sind". (Lie, TT, Vol. III , p.454). This </p><div id="pagenum"><p>would imply that, if G is a group which fulfils the axioms in TT, VoI.III, pp.454f., and if </p></div><div id="pagenum"><p>394 NOTES TO CHAPTER 3 </p></div><p id="page">Gp is a subgroup of G which leaves invariant a point P, then the group G.P =  {g.P I g E G}, acting on the tangent space at P, also fulfils those axioms (See Note 44).  Lie quotes several counterexamples which show that this assumption is false (one of  them is very clearly explained by Paul Herz in Helmholtz, SE, p.63). In IT, Vol.III,  pp.465-471, Lie shows however that the axioms in TT, Vol.III, pp.452f. do characterize  the Euclidean and the non-Euclidean motions of RJ if these axioms apply to every point  (not just to the points of general position -cf. Lie (1890), p.386) in an open connected  subset of R1• This proof does not depend on the group-theoretical equivalent of the  axiom of monodromy H4. On the other hand, if the axioms apply only to the points of  general position, they do not suffice to characterize those three groups of motions, even  if we add H4. A second set of axioms is given in IT, Vol.IlI, p.461; the proof that they  constitute a solution of the HL problem was suggested to Lie by Helmholtz's cal­ culations. Lie's main solutions of the HL problem are given in TT, Vol.III, pp.471-523.  The first one, which is described in the text, was also given in Lie's first paper of 1890.  The second one is proved for Rl only. It is based on a set of axioms (in IT, Vol. III,  pp.506f.) which make no assumptions concerning infinitesimal displacements. It might  seem, therefore, that this solution is more faithful .han :he first one to Helmholtz's  empiricist spirit.  +! Let us recall that if G is a Lie group acting on a manifold M, to every g in G there is  associated a unique analytic transformation of M which we have agreed to call g (also  L, -see p.173). An analytic transformation g: M...,. M induces at each P E M a mapping  g.p: Tp(M)...,.Tgp(M), which is defined as follows: given any analytic function f defined  on a neighbourhood of gP, the value of g.p(v) at f, for any v E Tp(M), is equal to the  value of v at f . g (the latter composite function is obviously defined on a neighbour­ hood of P).  45 Lie, IT, VoI.III, p.48l. Two groups are similar, in Lie's idiom, if one can be obtained  from the other through a coordinate transformation of the underlying manifold (ibid.,  p.364). I assume that a "real point transformation" of the complex manifold R. is a  coordinate transformation that maps real coordinates onto real coordinates, non-real  coordinates onto non-real ones (thUS preserving the division between real and im­ aginary points).  46 Lie, IT, Vol. III, p.538. The terms 'proper subgroup' and 'normal subgroup' are  defined in the Appendix, p.360.  47 Our definition of free mobility in the infinitesimal is inapplicable if n < 3. For n = 2,  we may restate it thus: Let G be a group acting on R2; G has free mobility in the  infinitesimal at a real point P E R2 if G contains a one-dimensional subgroup which fixes  P, but no subgroup of G, except {e}, fixes a non-zero tangent vector at P. The  Euclidean and non-Euclidean groups of motions of Rz possess free mobility in the  infinitesimal in this sense at a point of general position, but there is another group of Rz  which also possesses it. If x is a chart of R2, we can express a basis of the Lie algebra  of this group in terms of this chart as follows:  {.1.-a x' a -xl.1.-+C(X • .1.-+X2 a)} ax"a?' a? ax' ax' a?'  Here, c is any real number;ll! 0 (Lie (1890), p.290). This group is excluded by the </p><div id="pagenum"><p>two-dimensional analogon of the axiom of monodromy, which is probably the reason </p></div><div id="pagenum"><p>NOTES TO CHAPTER 3 395 </p></div><p id="page">why Helmholtz thought this axiom necessary also in the general n-dimensional case.  (See Helmholtz, G, p.21).  018 Poincare (1887).  ~9 Axiom D does the job Poincare expects it to do only if we assume that the distance  between two points P, Q is the same as the length of the segment PQ. This assumption  is implicit in Poincare's own statement of feature (a) of the geometry defined by the  one-sheet hyperboloid.  50 Killing (1892), p.I29.  51 Killing (1892), p.IS3.

(ii) The rotations about a point P constitute a group isomorphic to the  group of rotations about a point in R2. (iii) If P, Q are two points of 7T, there is a unique  point M E 7T, the midpoint of PQ, such that there exists a rotation g about M with  gP = Q and gQ = P. (g is called a half-rotation.) (iv) We can choose two points 0, E in  7T with the following property: let m denote the set generated from 0 and E by the  operations of taking midpoints and performing half-rotations; let m denote the set  {P I P is the limit of a convergent sequence of points in x(m)}; then m is the range of an  injective continuous mapping R-+R2; if g E G, gx-I(m) is called a true line.  58 Hilbert, GG, p.18In.  3.2 Axiomatics  I See also Descartes, AT, Vol.Vn, pp.I60-170; VoI.IX, pp.124-132.  2 "Les geometres supposent toutes ces propositions sans Ie dire." I have not seen a  copy of Lamy's book; I take this quotation from P. Rossier, "Les axiomes de la  geometrie et leur histoire" (1967), pp.379f., who obtained it from the 6th edition (1734).  3 See G. Goe (1962).  • See the passage quoted on p.49.  5 Pliicker, Neue Geometrie des Raumes (1868-69); see Nagel (1939), pp.188-192.  6 Strictly speaking, I demand that the set of axioms be computable. For a definition of  computable set see, e.g., M. Davis, Computability and Unsolvability. Informally, we  may say that a set S is computable if an ordinary computer with unlimited memory can  be programmed to determine whether any given object belongs to S or not.  1 Let me recall that Leon Henkin, in his justly celebrated paper on "Completeness in  the theory of types" (1950), uses a different concept of interpretation (and hence, a  different notion of logical consequence). In Henkin's semantics, object variables range </p><div id="pagenum"><p>over an arbitrary set of entities, as above, but first-order n-ary predicate variables range </p></div><div id="pagenum"><p>396 NOTES TO CHAPTER 3 </p></div><p id="page">over an arbitrary class of n-ary relations between the entities of that set. The latter  are freely stipulated in each interpretation. Henkin's semantics underlies Abraham  Robinson's "non-standard analysis", but is otherwise foreign to mathematical English  and its formalizations, as they are normally understood.  • See Oswald Veblen (1911), pp.5f.  9 The informal characterization of the structural equivalence of models of first-order  theories given above can be made more precise with the aid of a few auxiliary  concepts. We consider first a theory T in which all variables are of one kind. Let T*, 110  12, Dh D2 and f be as above. Let T~ be the set {s , S is a basic sentence and S belongs to  T*}. Let Ff3 be the collection of all sentence schemes ("formulae") obtainable by  replacing in each sentence of TI none or one or more than one of the object constants  that occur in it by free variables, in every conceivable combination. A variant of Ij is  an interpretation I; which differs from Ij at most in the denotations assigned to one or  more object variables. For each variable x, if the variant I; of II assigns to x the  denotation m E Dh the corresponding variant of 12 (relative to bijection f) assigns to x  the denotation f(m). The two models of T, II and 12, are structurally equivalent or  isomorphic if, and only if, for every formula", in Ff3, '" is satisfied in a variant I; of II  if, and only if, it is satisfied in the corresponding variant of 12, This characterization can  be easily extended to theories with object variables of several kinds, V 10 •.. , V n' Ij will  then allow the variables of type Vj to range over a domain Oi. f must be a bijection of  Uj Di onto Uj D~ that maps D\ onto D~ (1 .;;; j .;;; n).  10 A more precise characterization will be found in Grzegorczyk, OML, pp.347ff.  II See below, Notes 74 and 124.  12 See John Mayberry (1977).  Il The better known axiom systems for set theory derive from those propounded by  Zermelo in 1908 and by von Neumann in 1925. (In English in Heijenoort, FFG,  pp.l99ff., 393ff.) All such systems contain axioms to the effect that if some definite set  or sets exist, then another set also exists. Particularly far reaching is the so-called  Axiom of the Power Set: If a set S exists, the set of all subsets of S -called the power  set of S and denoted in this book by ~(S) -also exists.  14 Stewart, WW, VoI.II1, p.1l7.

Theorem I.S says that if two proper points A, B lie on a line m.  you can always choose a proper point C on m which lies between A and B (Pasch,  VNG. p.IO). Pasch remarks however that this theorem cannot be applied to a given line  an indefinite number of times (Ibid., p.IS). Theorem I.S follows immediately from  Axiom S II. It can also be derived from Axioms S I. S VI, SIX, E IV (Hilbert, GG, p.5,  Satz 3). Consequently, one or more of these axioms have a restricted application. Such  are the miseries of mathematical empiricism.  13 Pasch, VNG 2, p.l74 (added in the 2nd edition).  74 This corresponds to our distinction between interpretable and non-interpretable  words.

We shall deal later with these geometries, in connection with Hilbert's  Grundlagen (p.237).

For the 7th edition, Hilbert revised the text quite  thoroughly. Important changes had been made earlier in the second edition (1903). All  changes are carefully noted in Hilbert-Rossier, FG.  104 Hilbert, GG, p.l.  105 Hilbert, 00, p.2.  106 On these matters, however, oplmons are not unanimous. Thus, the great Danish  geometer J. Hjemslev, who considered Axiom II ("Two points determine a straight  line") intuitively false, because intuitive points and lines are not widthless, counted the  Archimedean axiom as intuitively evident, apparently because he expected his "natural  geometry" or "geometry of reality" to be displayable on a drawing-board. See  Hjelmslev (1923), p.7.  101 Hilbert, GO, p.l.  108 Hilbert, GO, pp.125.  109 Hilbert's definition of triangle (GG, p.9) covers the degenerate case in which the  three vertices are collinear, but he tacitly assumes that every triangle he mentions is not  degenerate. This assumption was made explicit by Bernays in a note added to the 8th  edition (GO, p.14).  110 Axiom V 2 did not appear in the first edition. Its necessity was pointed out by  Hilbert in a lecture "Ueber den Zahlbegriff" delivered in 1899. (Appendix VI of 00,  7th edition; suppressed in later editions.) The French translation of the Grundlagen by  Laugel, published in 1900, includes a note, signed by Hilbert, which reads, in part, as  follows: "Remarquons qu'aux cinq pnkedents groupes d'axiomes I'on peut encore  ajouter I'axiome suivant qui n'est pas d'une nature purement geometrique [ ... J: Au  systeme des points, droites et plans, iI est impossible d'adjoindre d'autres ttres de  maniere que Ie systeme ainsi generalise forme une nouvelle geometrie OU les axiomes des  cinq groupes (I) a (V) soient tous verifies; en d' autres termes; les elements de la  geometrie forment un systeme d'ttres qui, si /' on conserve tous les axiomes, n' est  susceptible d'aucune extension. [ ... J La valeur de cet axiome au point de vue des  principes, tient [ ... J a ce que I'existence de tous les points limites en est une  consequence et que, par suite, cet axiome rend possible la correspondance univoque et  reversible des points d'une droite et de tous les nombres reels." (Hilbert-Rossier, FG,  pp.43f.). Editions 2-6 carry the following version of V 2: "The elements of geometry,  points, lines and planes, constitute a system of objects which, if you assume the  foregoing axioms, does not admit any extension." In the 7th edition, a statement similar  to this is proved as Theorem 32. A discussion in depth of the axiom of completeness is  given in Bernays (1955). See also Baldus (1928).  111 I paraphrase this axiom from Baldus (1937), p.225. It implies that every segment  PoQo will share the property ascribed to AoBo. Copy AoBo on a plane on which Po and Qo  lie. Let lines AoPo and BoQo meet at Z. Lines ZAi and ZBi meet line PoQo at Pi and Qi'  respectively. The sequence «Pi, Qi» fulfils conditions (i) and (ii). Line ZX meets PoQo  at Y. Y lies between Pn and Qn, for every positive integer n.

On the other hand, if K is unsatisfiable, every interpretation which satisfies  K (i.e. none at all) will satisfy any arbitrary sentence. Consequently, for any sentence S,  KFS and KFIS. Hence, K is inconsistent.  liS We say that an axiomatic theory T, with axioms K, is soundly formalized within a  calculus C if a sentence S can be proved from K in C only if K F S. See p.I92, Section  3.2.2.  116 Let K be formalized in a calculus C. The syntactical consistency of K in this  formalization can be established by showing that a proof from K in C cannot possibly  terminate in a particular sentence of C. This can usually be done by studying the  possible outcome of a few well-defined operations on finite strings of symbols.  117 The following remark might prevent some misunderstandings. The syntactical  consistency of the arithmetic of natural numbers in its standard formalization was  demonstrated by Gentzen in 1936. He had to resort to methods of proof that one would  normally regard as less unquestionable than those of arithmetic itself. But if Gentzen's  result is correct, then, on the strength of Godel's theorem (Godel (1931), Theorem XI),  that formalization cannot be complete. Consequently, the syntactical consistency of  arithmetic in that formalization does not ensure its consistency in our (semantical)  sense of the word.  118 Pascal's theorem is a theorem in projective geometry which says that, if six distinct  points Ph P2, Pl, P4, Ps, P6 lie on a conic, the points of intersection PIP2 np 4PS,  P2P3np lP6, and P3P4nP 6PI lie on a line. The theorem used by Hilbert says that if Ph  p}, Ps lie on a line and P2, P4, P6 lie on another line, then, if PIP2 is parallel to P4PS, and  P2P} is parallel to PSP6, PlP4 is parallel to P6PI• This is clearly the restriction of Pascal's  theorem to the affine plane, with a degenerate conic equal to two straight lines and the  points of intersection on the line 'at infinity'.  119 Dehn (1900).  120 In Euclid's and Hilbert's sense, i.e. coplanar and not concurrent.  121 A modified version of Veblen's axioms of order was reproduced on p.197. This  modified version is taken from the axiom system of Veblen (1911), which, following the  example of R.L. Moore (1908), includes congruence of segments among the undefined  concepts.  122 Huntington (1902), p.277.  12l Veblen (1904), p.346.  124 Like Peano and Veblen, Huntington regards the signs that stand for the set­ theoretical predicates "x is a set", "x is an element of set y", as "symbols which are  necessary for all logical reasoning" (Huntington (1913), p.526), and treats them as  non-interpretable words.  12S Huntington (1913), p.530.  126 Huntington (1913), p.524.  127 Huntington (1913), p.540.  118 A lattice is a triple (S, U, n), where S is a set and U and n are two associative and  commutative binary operations on S, such that for any u and v in S, u U (u n v) =  un (u U v) = u, u n v is usually called the meet and u U v the join of u and v. In the  case mentioned in the text above, for any two spheres A and B, let their join be the </p><div id="pagenum"><p>smallest sphere which contains A and B while their meet is the largest sphere which is </p></div><div id="pagenum"><p>402 NOTES TO CHAPTER 3 </p></div><p id="page">contained in A and in B.

Frege made this point again in the second of his two articles on  Hilbert's Grund/agen (Frege, KS, p.268), and in the first of his three articles in reply to  Korselt (Frege, KS, p.29l). These five articles (as well as Korselt's) bear the same title:  "Ueber die Grundlagen der Geometrie".  143 Cf. Freudenthal (1957), p.116.  144 Hilbert, GG, p.28. In the first edition, Hilbert used indifferently the words Definition  and Erkliirung. After Frege suggested that these two words might express two different  ideas, Hilbert changed all occurrences of Definition into Erk/iirung. (See Frege, KS,  p.407).  145 Pieri (l899a), p.3 n.6. Cf.

The kind of "invertible univocal transformation" which Hilbert  has in mind has been illustrated above, on pp.81f.  148 As a matter of fact, the analogy between Hilbert's axiom system and a system of  simultaneous equations was used by Frege as an argument against the viability of the  former: "If we survey the whole of Mr. Hilbert's definitions and axioms, they will be  seen to be comparable to a system of equations with many unknowns; for in each  axiom you normally find several of the unknown expressions "point", "line", "plane",  "lie on", "between", etc., so that only the whole, not particular axioms or groups of  axioms, can suffice to determine the unknowns. But does the whole suffice? Who can  say that this system is solvable for the unknowns, and that these are unambiguously  determined?" (Frege, KS, p.268; cf. p.416.) In his Philosophy of Space and Time  (1928), Hans Reichenbach claims that there are equations that determine an unknown </p><div id="pagenum"><p>implicitly and are not solvable for it. Axioms, according to him, are comparable to such </p></div><div id="pagenum"><p>NOTES TO CHAPTER 4 403 </p></div><p id="page">equations. He mentions by way of example the equation x = sin y, which, he says, is  not solvable for y. Though this equation can also be written "in the apparently solved  form y = arc sin x. .. the meaning of the function arc sin is defined only by the  previously given implicit equation." (Reichenbach, PST, p.93.) The champion of  Scientific Philosophy evidently overlooked that (i) x = sin y does not determine y;  (ii) the system x = sin y, -11'/2 < Y < 11'/2, which does determine y, is solved explicitly by . f dt ( -I < x < O. y = VI- t2  o  149 Gergonne (1SIS), p.13.

Early Draft of the Logic, ibid. pp.IOS3-1097.  That the first principles of arithmetic are generalizations from experience is stated on  p.257. Arithmetic, however, differs from geometry in so far as the former "is deduced  wholly from propositions exactly true", while the latter partly depends, as we shall see,  on "hypotheses or assumptions which are only approximations to the truth".

The reader will not fail to observe that the last of the two  axioms is incompatible with BL geometry while the first excludes spherical geometry.

The 'proof' of the theorem involves many tacit  assumptions, whereby, among other things, elliptic and spherical geometry are im­ plicitly excluded.  35 Ueberweg, PG, p.291.  36 Theorem 47 (Ueberweg, PG, p.304).  37 Theorem 49b (Ibid., p.305).  38 See Section 3.1.2. Erdmann's version of the axioms is considerably less precise than  Helmholtz's (Erdmann, AG, p.83).  39 Erdmann, AG, p.38. In the same year, 1877, in which Erdmann's book was pub­ lished, Georg Cantor discovered that the above expression of dimension number is  inadequate, because R" can be mapped bijectively onto R. See Cantor, GA, pp.119-133.  Cantor's proof is sketched in Kline, MT, pp.997f.  40 "Die Teilbarkeit ins unendliche, die jeder Raumanschauung anhaftet" (Erdmann,  AG, p.38). This is, of course, highly questionable as a description of spatial perception.  We must assume that Erdmann, like most empiricist philosophers, allows the bounty of  imagination to make up for the stinginess of the senses.  41 Erdmann, AG, p.39. The alleged intuitive fact of infinite divisibility does not warrant  the empwyment of such strong analytical means for expressing it. It would suffice to let  the coordinates take all rational values between their value at A and their value at B, or  merely all values expressible by means of a terminating decimal fraction .  ., Erdmann, AG, p.40.  43 Coordinates XI, X2, X3 are 'interchangeable' in Erdmann's sense if distances measured </p><div id="pagenum"><p>along each coordinate axis (i.e. along each line Xi = Xj = 0; i'¢ j) are comparable with </p></div><div id="pagenum"><p>NOTES TO CHAPTER 4 405 </p></div><p id="page">distances measured along the other two. (Erdmann, AG, p.42). The distinction in the  text presupposes, therefore, the concept of distance. Erdmann apparently takes it for  granted. As an example of the second kind of 3-fold determined continuous quantity he  mentions the manifold of sounds, each of which is defined by its height, intensity and  timbre. Cf. the critical remarks in Ernst Mach, EI, pp.392ff.  44 Erdmann does not seem to be aware of the difference between the general Rieman­ nian concept of a (continuous) manifold and the concept of an R-manifold, i.e. one  endowed with a Riemannian metric. Erdmann alludes to the latter in AG, p.59.  45 Erdmann, AG, pp.58f.  46 Erdmann, AG, p.69. An additional argument for the flatness of space is given on  p.99. It is based on "the perception (die Wahmehmung) that the direction of a moving  body can be regarded, within the limits of our experience, as completely independent of  its position (Ort)". Erdmann surely refers to a body moving in empty space, for the  direction of a body moving in the presence of other bodies appears to be strongly  influenced by its position relative to them, especially if they are very large. One may  wonder indeed how Erdmann managed to perceive a body moving all by itself in  absolutely empty space.  47 Erdmann, AG, pp.93f.  48 Erdmann, AG, p.1l6.  49 Erdmann, AG, p.I46.  50 Cf.

'5 Erdmann extensively quotes the Erlangen Programme in AG, pp.124f., n.2. Had he  read it? That he remained untouched by Klein's views can be gathered from the  peculiar distinction he makes between the fonn and the contents of space: The form  comprises those properties which are common to all n-dimendional manifolds, while  the contents of our space consists in "the triplicity of dimensions and the flatness of  metrical relations" (Erdmann, AG, p.143).

Calinon (1891), p.368; "La Geometrie generale est l'etude  de tous les groupes de formes dont les definitions premieres sont astreintes a une  condition unique, qui est de ne donner lieu a aucune contradiction, lorsqu'on les soumet  au raisonnement geometrique indefiniment prolonge".  68 Calinon (1891), p.375.

Calinon's "general geometry" embraces Euclidean geometry,  BL geometry and the so-called geometry of Riemann, that is, spherical or elliptic  geometry. It is, in other words, a theory of maximally symmetric spaces (p.184). The  name "general geometry" indicates that Calinon was less open-minded than he thought.  71 The same paradox had motivated Taurinus' rejection of BL geometry. See p.53.  72 Calinon (1891), pp.368f. Identical spaces, in this sense, were called isogenous  (isogenes) by Delboeuf, a term often used in the French literature of this period.

The paper of 1893 is written in what the author calls an  "idealistic" language; that is, space is identified there with our perceptually based  representation of space. Calinon says that his views on the matters discussed by him  can also be set forth in a realistic language, a task which he proposes as an exercise to  the reader. In a realistic version of Calinon's paper we ought perhaps to ascribe a  definite though unknown geometric structure to physical space. But it seems clear that  in Calinon's opinion it makes no scientific sense to state hypotheses about such a  structure. The choice of a geometry in physics must be made in the light of the  requirements of the problem at hand, not with a view to determining the essence of  things in themselves.  77 Published in the Revue generate des sciences on December 15, 1891. See Part 4.4.  78 Calinon (1893), p.607. Such are also the criteria usually applied when choosing a  coordinate system. It is amazing that the great mathematician Poincare should have  overlooked this side of the analogy drawn by him.  79 Calinon (1893), p.607.  80 Mach, EI, pp.337-448.

Mach, EI, p.345.  8~ Mach distinguished the geometrical and the physiological properties of a figure in  space in his Beitriige zur Analyse der Empfindungen (1886), pp.44, 54, long before  Poincare introduced the concepts of espace geometrique and espace representatif in  "L'espace et la geometrie" (1895).  86 Mach, EI, p.337.  87 Mach, EI, p.339.  88 I gather this from the statement in Mach, EI, p.343, that physiological space as such  is three-dimensional. Since haptic space is said to be two-dimensional (Ibid., p.340), the  third dimension can only be given by the optic space (unless we view it as belonging  only to the acoustic or, say, the olfactory component of physiological space).  89 Mach, EI. p.340.  90 Mach, EI, p.347. I fail to see how the experiences described by Mach might justify  the conclusion that space is infinite, and not just unlimited. This is one of those wild  speculative jumps that empiricists must make every now and then to reconcile their  philosophy with experience.  91 Mach, EI, p.355. The reader will probably notice that in order to transport a body  from a neighbourhood FGH to a neighbourhood MNO, as required by the experiment  described above, we must regard it as located in the unitary objective physical space  whose very idea supposedly arises out of such experiments.  92 Mach, EI, p.434.  93 Mach, EI, p.367.  94 Mach, EI, p.380.  91 Mach, EI, p.367.  96 Mach, EI, p.368.  97 Mach, EI, pp.368f.  98 Mach, EI, p.380. The last remark, in fact, agrees with the opinion of authors such as  Klein and Enriques, who emphasized the optical origin of our idea of straightness, for  they saw in visual intuition the root of projective, not of metric geometry (see above,  Section 2.3.10, p.147; Enriques, PS, pp.205ff.).  99 Mach, EI, p.370.  100 Mach, EI, p.37!.  101 Mach, EI, p.385.  102 Mach, EI, p.409.  103 Mach, EI, p.414.  104 Mach, EI, p.418.  lOS Mach, EI, p.418.  4.2 The Uproar of Boeotians  1 Krause, loc. cit., p.S4; quoted by Schlick in Helmholtz, SE, p.29, n.25.  2 Tobias, loc. cit., p.81; quoted by Erdmann (AG, p.IIS).

Dann wiirden wir nur glauben, eine neue sehr sonderbare Art  der Refraction entdeckt zu haben, welche die zur Bestimmung der Richtungen dienen­ den Lichtstrahlen abgelenkt habe; d.h. wir wiirden auf ein besonderes Verhalten des  physischen Realen im Raume, aber gewiss nicht auf ein Verhalten des Raumes selbst  schliessen, das allen unseren Anschauungen widersprache und durch keine eigene  exceptionelle Anschauung verbiirgt wiirde." (Lotze, M, pp.248f.). See the comments in  Russell, FG, p.IOO. Poincare make a similar remark, without quoting Lotze, in "Les  geometries non-Euclidiennes" (1891), p.774 (now in Poincare, SH, pp.95f.).  \0 A transcendental deduction proves the necessity of a statement by showing that it  expresses a condition of the possibility of an established branch of knowledge. See  Part. 4.3.  II In his paper "Ueber das kosmologische Problem" (1877). In pp.105-113, Wundt  discusses Zoellner's use of "transcendent geometry" for constructing a temporally  eternal but spatially finite model universe. He mentions in passing what he believes are  the absurd consequences of a non-zero space curvature. In his opinion, the motion of  rigid bodies would be impossible in a curved space, even if its curvature is constant.  "In einem sphlirischen Raum von drei Dimensionen, z.B wiirde, da diejenigen Linien,  die den Parallelen im Euklidischen Raum entsprechen, grosste Kreise sind, ein Korper  bei der Translocation von einem bestimmten Punkte an zuerst sich ausdehnen und dann  wieder zusammenziehen."

This is one of the many passages where Kant might seem to favour  a psychological conception of the a priori.  6 In The Principles of Mathematics (1903), Russell will try to prove that abstract set  theory is only a branch of logic and is therefore, so to speak, trivially a priori. Later  developments have shown that this thesis can only be upheld if we broaden logic well  beyond its traditional limits in such a way that we can no longer regard its apriority as  trivial. (The triviality of pre-Russellian -or rather pre-Fregean -logic is shown by the  fact that we can encode its truths and programme a computer to recognize them; the  truths of modern logic can also be encoded, but it is demonstrably impossible to design  a general method of computation for deciding whether a formula in the appropriate  code does or does not represent a logical truth.)  7 Russell, FG, p.28.  • Russell, FG, p.1l8.  9 Russell, FG, p.132.  \0 This suggestion conflicts with the thesis held by Russell in FG that the concept of a  point is self-contradictory. Russell refutes this silly notion in his Principles, Chapter 51.  But even in FG he is able to treat space as a point-set by introducing the concept of a  purely geometrical matter, whose elements or "atoms" are unextended and supply the  terms for spatial relations. See Russell, FG, pp.77ff., 190ff.; and below, p.315, Section  4.3.5.  II Replying to a critical review by Poincare (1899), Russell writes: "Je ne pretends pas  que deux points dejinissent une droite. Je soutiens, au contraire, que chaque droite est  simple et inanalysable, et par suite indefinissable. Ce que je veux dire est ceci:  'L'ensemble complet des Iignes droites etant donne, il suffit de mentionner deux points  de l'une d'elles pour la distinguer de toutes les autres, en tant qu'elle est specialement  Iiee a ces deux points'''. (Russell, 1899, p.696). This explanation, however, will not  increase the deductive power of Axiom III, or of the other axioms.  12 The reader is advised to read the argument in Russell, FG, pp.136f.  t3 Russell. FG, pp.139f. Russell's rejection of infinite-dimensional spaces is not an  instance of mathematical ignorance -such spaces had not yet been discovered -but of  a typically unmathematical narrow-mindedness which often crops up in philosophical  literature.  14 See Peano (1890).

Since these axioms fail to  characterize projective space, the clash between Russell's statements is more apparent  than real.  24 Russell, FG, p.161.  2' Russell, FG, p.163.

Cf. especially p.192, where geometrical matter is said to be  composed of simple unextended atoms, which contain no real diversity and whose only  function is to supply terms for spatial relations.

The deduction of the axiom of free mobility from the relativity  of position in Russell, FG, p.I60, begs the question. Relativity of position implies that  the form of externality is homogeneous, says Russell, and free mobility follows from  homogeneity "for our form would not be homogeneous unless it allowed, in every part,  shapes or systems of relations, which it allowed in any other part" (Ibid.). This  argument makes sense only if metrically determined shapes have been defined in our  form of externality.  37 Couturat (1898), p.373f.  38 Russell (1898), p.763.  39 Russell, FG, pp.158f .  ..

This is, of course, to an excellent approximation, the  length of the old platinum-iridium rod which had been defined to be one metre long in  1889.  4 Neumann, PGNT, p.18.  5 Lange (1885), p.337. Instead of translating Lange's text, I have quoted the English  paraphrase given in Robertson and Noonan, RC, p.13. Lange motivated his definition as  follows: "Just as the one-dimensional inertial time scale could be defined by means of a  single free particle (sich selbst iiberlassener Punkt), we can define the three-dimen­ sional inertial system by means of three free particles. [ ... J Given three (or less than  three), not necessarily free. particles P. P', P", in relative motion, it is always possible  to construct a coordinate system [ ... J relatively to which those particles move in a  straight line. On the other hand, if we are given more than three points, this possibility  exists only accidentally, under particular circumstances. It follows that the law of the  unchanging direction of motion of free particles is a mere convention in the case of  three such particles, and expresses a remarkable result of scientific research only in so  far as it is true of more than three, indeed of arbitrarily many particles, with respect to  one and the same system. The physical condition of freedom from outer disturbance  (Unbeeinflusstsein) has precisely this very remarkable kinematic consequence: for  arbitrarily many particles subject to that condition there exists a coordinate system  wherein they all move in a straight line." (Lange (1885) p.337.)  • Lange (1885), p.338 (my paraphrase). These so-called theorems are of course postu­ lates. Lange's "proof" of the first is really a consistency proof: given an inertial system  relatively to which a particle moves in a straight line, one cannot construct a second </p><div id="pagenum"><p>inertial system relatively to which that same particle does not move in a straight line. </p></div><div id="pagenum"><p>NOTES TO CHAPTER 4 413 </p></div><p id="page">7 The most complete study of Poincare's philosophy of geometry is still Rougier, La  philosophie geometrique de Henri Poincare (1920). The book by Mooij, La philosophie  des mathematiques de Henri Poincare (1966) devotes to it only a short rather unil­ luminating chapter (pp.3-29). A penetrating analysis of its foundations is given in  Vuillemin (1972).  8 On axiomatic theories, see above, Section 3.2.2, pp.191ff. Black's concept of an  axiomatic or, as he says, a deductive theory is not quite the same as ours. The theory  determined by a set of axioms A is not, as with us, the set of logical consequences of  A, but the set of sentences provable from A in accordance with the agreed rules of  inference. The latter are not specified by Black, but he presumably expected them to be  effective and to ape the relation of logical consequence. Practically any such theory  qualifies as a 'geometry' in Black's sense, since, as he says, "the term geometry [ ... J  when applied to a deductive theory indicates little more than an indefinite degree of  resemblance of formal structure in relation to certain familiar and historically important  deductive theories." (Black (1942), p.340.)  9 "There can be little doubt that any deductive theory is capable of translation into a  'contrary' deductive theory." (Black (1942), p.345). Black does 1I0t say "into any  contrary theory", but, as we shall see, his thesis on the translatability of axiomatic  theories does not lend support to geometrical conventionalism unless we understand it  in this strong sense.  10 On m-English, see pp.193ff. Black, following the fashion of the thirties, initially  describes a deductive theory as "a 'game' played with symbols, arranged in given initial  positions, and manipUlated in accordance with certain rules of play (or rather the  totality of positions obtained in some such game)". But he adds immediately: "Not  every game will qualify as a deductive system, however; the initial positions must bear  some resemblance to the sentences of ordinary language, and the rules of play are to  approximate more or less closely to 'rules of inference'. More precisely, any specimen  of a deductive theory will consist of sentences, i.e. strings of symbols, designating  either logical connectives, relations and predicates, or individual variables." (Black  (1942), p.339.) This is almost equivalent to saying that any deductive theory can be  rendered in m-English directly and without paraphrase. But even if it were not so, it is  enough to show that a theory which can be thus rendered cannot be translated into one  of its contraries, to destroy Black's contention (in the strong sense in which we agreed  to understand it in Note 9).  II Black (1942), pp.34If.  12 I agree on this point with Sklar (1969), p.45, though I do not share the grounds  proposed by him for this opinion. He says that, since the propositions of pure geometry  are neither true nor false, they cannot be conventionally true or false. But Poincare  maintained that geometry was conventional precisely because it was neither true nor  false. The expression "true by convention" is never used by Poincare. I imagine that he  WOUld, quite rightly, have judged it meaningless.  13 See Tarski, LSM, p.306; also pp.243, 248, Section 3.2.9.  14 Poincare (1891), p.774; reprinted in SH, p.77.  15 "Ie considere I'axiome des trois dimensions comme conventionnel au meme titre que  ceux d'Euclide" (Poincare (1900), p.73).

In a paper written shortly before his death, Poincare  wrote however that "it is the external world, it is experience, which determines us" to  choose a three-dimensional model of space (Poincare, DP, p.157; my italics).  16 Kant, KrV, B 146, A557/B585, A613f./B64lf.  17 In its original context (in the paper of 1891 on non-Euclidean geometries) the  argument against apriorism read as follows: Are geometrical axioms "synthetic a priori  judgments, as Kant said? They would then impose themselves on us with such force  that we should be unable to conceive the contrary proposition or to build a theory upon  it. There would not be a non-Euclidean geometry". (Poincare, SH, p.74.) In 1895, he  proposed a different argument, directed, it would seem, more specifically against Kant's  doctrine: "If geometrical space were a frame imposed on each of our representations  individually considered it would be impossible to represent an image stripped of this  frame and we could not change anything in our geometry". (Poincare, SH, p.88.) Even  this second argument falls wide of the mark, insofar as Kant did not view space as a  frame imposed on each of our sense-perceptions considered individually, but on all of  them considered as a manifold. Both texts were reprinted without alterations in La  science et I'hypothese (1903).  18 Poincare, DP, p.157: "I shall conclude that we all have in us the intuition of a  continuum of an arbitrary number of dimensions, because we have the faculty of  constructing a physical and mathematical continuum; that this faculty precedes all  experience, because without it experience properly so called would be impossible and  would reduce itself to crude sensations, incapable of being organised in any way; that  this intuition is nothing but our awareness (conscience) of this faculty". This sounds  like a modified Kantianism, quite consonant with its original spirit. See, e.g., Kant, Ak.,  Vol.XVlI, p.639, where the a priori intuition of space is described as awareness  (Bewusstsein) of one's own aptitude to perceive things according to certain relation­ ships.  19 Poincare, SH, Chapter V, "L'experience et Ie geometrie", a chapter composed of  passages pieced together from Poincare (1891), (1899), (1900), plus a short summary of  some of the ideas presented in Poincare (1898).  20 See Section 4.4.5.  21 Poincare, SH, p.76; Poincare (1898), pp.42f.

Compare Einstein's formulation of the general principle of  relativity: "Natural laws are only statements about spatio-temporal coincidences;  therefore their natural expression must consist in generally covariant equations".  (Einstein (1918), p.241.)  24 Minkowski (1908). In fact, Minkowski's contribution concerned only the underlying  manifold of special relativity, which he showed to be a semi-Riemannian 4-manifold  (see Appendix, p.372). But he paved the way for the four-dimensional formulation of  Newtonian mechanics by Cartan (1923, 1924).  25 In 1912, he described Minkowski's spacetime geometry as "a new convention"  which some physicists had adopted not because they were "constrained" to do so, but  because they found it "more comfortable".

On "Riemann's geometry" see Part  2.2, Note 52.  28 Poincare foresaw the rise of "an entirely new mechanics chiefly characterized by the  fact that no velocity can surpass that of light".

The normal subgroup in question is the group of translations;  see above, p.178. Normal subgroups are defined in the Appendix, p.360. Today's  mathematicians call a group 'simple' if it contains no proper normal subgroups. (See,  e.g., Kurosh, TG, Vol.I, p.68.) If we adopt this terminology, Poincare's thesis must be  restated thus: the Euclidean group is simpler than the two classical non-Euclidean  groups because the latter are simple, while the former is not. This seeming paradox  bears witness to the ambiguity of simplicity.  33 Poincare, Oeuvres, VoI.XI, p.91. The "operations" of the group are not what we  would call thus (namely, the group product and the mapping which assigns to every  element its own inverse), but simply the elements of the group; the group is viewed as  "operating" through them on an underlying space.  34 A topological group is a group G endowed with a topology by virtue of which the  mapping (g, h)>-+ gh-I (g, hE G) is a continuous mapping. The effective and transitive  action of a topological group on a topological space is defined like that of a Lie group  on a differentiable manifold (make the action continuous in the definition on p.I72).  3l I cannot understand why Sklar (1969), p.47, stresses the fact that in the usual  Euclidean models of BL geometry the BL group is allowed to act only on a fragment of  R3 (an open ball, a half-space; see Section 2.3.7). Let B denote the interior of a sphere  in R2; B is homeomorphic with R3. Let f: B-+R3 be an homeomorphism. Let G be the  set of all continuous transformations of B which map chords onto chords and preserve  a given orientation of B. G is a group isomorphic with the BL group (p.l40).  {fgf-I I g E G} is then a group of continuous transformations of R3 which is plainly  isomorphic with G, and hence with the BL group.  36 This group -call it G -is a compact topological group with a countable base of its  topology (Appendix, p.360). Suppose that G acts transitively on R3, choose a point  p E R3 and let H denote the set {g I g E G and gp = pl. H is a closed subgroup of G  known as the stability (or isotropy) group of p. The quotient space G/H is compact.  Since R3 is Hausdorff and locally compact (i.e. every point in R3 has a compact  neighbourhood), it follows that G/H is homeomorphic with R3. But this is absurd,  because R3 is not compact. Consequently, our supposition that G acts transitively on R3  cannot be true.

Lie's concept of a Zahlenmannigfaltigkeit is discussed in Part  3.1, Note 42.  41 Let u, v, w E G. fJ.(wH) = uvwH = f •• (wH). Consequently, f is a realization.  f •• -1(vH) = uH. Consequently, f is transitive.  42 Let g E H. f (H) = gH = H. On the other hand, if gl H, f.(H) = gH # H.  Consequently {g f g E G and f.(H) = H} = H.  43 It is very likely that Poincare's dictionary of 1891 inspired Max Black with the  interpretation of conventionalism in geometry that was discussed in Section 4.4.2. I  must point out, however, that Poincare's dictionary cannot be used mutatis mutandis  for "translating" (in Black's sense) a formalized version L of Lobachevskian geometry  into a formalized version E of Euclidean geometry. The dictionary presupposes that we  have picked out a Euclidean plane 71" and a side + of 71". Only then can we define with  Poincare: Space = half-space on side + of 71"; plane = sphere meeting 71" at right angles;  straight line = circle meeting 71" at right angles; distance between points x and y =  logarithm of the cross-ratio of x, y and the two points where a circle through x and y  meets 71" at right angles (Poincare, SH, p.68). But E need not, and indeed should not,  include any logical constants, because there are no distinguished points, lines or planes  in Euclidean space. Consequently, E will not have a proper name for our plane 71", let  alone for its preferred side.  44 Poincare (1900), p.8l.  4S Poincare (1900), p.85; SH, p.l04.  46 A valuable recent exception is Vuillemin (1972).  47 Poincare, SH, p.5\.  .. Poincare (1898), p.l.  .... I do not think that the poor wretch would be able to see anything, unless he is aided  by the recollection of better times; but then, as I said, I reject sensationism. For  someone who accepts it, the man in my example must enjoy 'pure' visual sensations.  so Poincare, VS, pp.73f.; (1898), p.2.  SI Poincare, (1898), p.3.  S2 Instead of cancels, Poincare says corrects. Instead of locomotion he says displace­ ment. See Note 55.  S3 As a matter of fact, Poincare reasons as if a given internal change could set in in any  state of sense awareness. This sounds impossible. Thus, it would seem that in order to  experience the feeling of walking one must feel first that one is standing on the ground.  An astronaut falling freely in outer space cannot suddenly start walking. We must bear  in mind, however, that an obliging demon could, in principle, always suitably modify  the gravitational field and place a magic carpet beneath our astronaut's feet at the very  moment in which he sets out to walk.  S4 Poincare, VS, pp.72f. Poincare's assertion betrays the mathematician's penchant to  conceive things with greater neatness than they will bear. It is actually false. Suppose  A, B, C are the internal changes felt when one steps forward 2 yards, 2 yards k inches  and 2 yards 2k inches, respectively. Choose the value of k so that you can distinguish  A from C, but you cannot perceive the difference between A and B, nor that between B  and C. There is some external change A' which is cancelled by A and not by C. There is </p><div id="pagenum"><p>also some external change B' which is cancelled by B. Obviously B' is cancelled by A </p></div><div id="pagenum"><p>NOTES TO CHAPTER 4 417 </p></div><p id="page">and by C, since both are indistinguishable from B. This contradicts Poincare's asser­ tion.  " In 1898, Poincare used the word displacement both in this sense and as a synonym  of our term locomotion. This creates some confusion. In 1903, he called external  locomotions changements de position; internal locomotions, deplacements du corps en  bloc (Poincare, VS, p.79), and reserved deplacement as a name for an equivalence class  of locomotions. He lacks a word for locomotions composed of internal and external  changes.  S6 There is one noticeable difference between walking on a conveyor-belt and rowing in  a tied boat: the latter activity can be interrupted without giving rise to any external  change; on the other hand, whenever the former stops, one will be rapidly carried  backwards (unless the conveyor is arranged to stop as soon as you cease stamping your  feet on it). But according to our definitions the nature and identity of an internal change  depends exclusively on the muscular sensations involved in it.  S7 Now Chapter II of La science et I'hypothese.  S8 I.e. the topology consisting of the empty set and all the unions of open intervals.  S9 An n-dimensional topological manifold is a topological space everyone of whose  points has a neighbourhood homeomorphic with R". A concept substantially equivalent  to this was introduced by Poincare himself in his pioneering work "Analysis situs"  (1895).  60 Poincare, SH, p.51.  6' Poincare (1898), pp.14f. Poincare's argument implies that every displacement is  joined to 0 by a simple physical continuum; it follows easily that any two displace­ ments are also joined thus.  62 The italicized assumption is made in Poincare (1903), but not in Poincare (1898).  Instead of it, the earlier work assumes the following: If locomotions A, A' are cancelled  by X, and B, B' are cancelled by Y, then A + B and A' + B' are cancelled by Y + X. This  also conflicts with the physical continuity of the group of displacements. For let A and  B be instances of kd, A' and B', instances of (k + l)d, where k and d are as above; then  A + B and A' + B' are instances of 2kd and (2k + 2)d, respectively, and they will not be  cancelled by the same locomotion.  63 Poincare fails to make this distinction (in 1898, he even calls locomotions and  displacements by the same name). But it is unavoidable, because locomotions do not  form a group (not every locomotion X can be added to a given locomotion A to  make A + X, but only those whose initial state is indistinguishable from the final state  of A) .  ... Poincare (1898), p.21. Poincare's assertion depends on Lie's second main solution of  the Lie-Helmholtz space problem (Lie, IT, Vol. III , pp.506f.; see Part 3.1, Note 43, ad  finem). This presupposes that the group in question is a Lie group. Can this be said of  g))? It has been observed lately that "it is difficult to estimate to which degree [Lie's]  proofs [in this second main solution] can withstand modern demands of rigour".  Freudenthal (1965), p.152.) Lie's first main solution is generally acknowledged to be  rigorous, but it depends on the assumption of free mobility in the infinitesimal (p.178)  which Poincare has not proved for g)). </p><div id="pagenum"><p>6S Poincare puts this as follows: "Displacements, we have seen, correspond to changes </p></div><div id="pagenum"><p>418 NOTES TO CHAPTER 4 </p></div><p id="page">in our sensations, and if we distinguish in the present group between form and material,  the material can be nothing else than that which the displacements cause to change,  viz., our sensations. Even if we suppose that what we have above called sensible space  has already been elaborated, the material would then be represented by as many  continuous variables as there are nerve-fibres."

Poincare (1895), now in SH, p.82. By drawing our attention  to the fact that Euclidean space is not a whit more imaginable than the non-Euclidean  spaces Poincare has finally disposed of a staple Boeotian argument.  70 Poincare (1898), p.42.  71 Poincare, SH, p.76.  72 Poincare (1898), p.42.  73 His main contribution is contained in his long paper "Analysis situs" (1895) and its  five supplements, published between 1899 and 1904. But the "qualitative theory" of  differential equations developed in his four papers "Sur les courbes definies par une  equation differentielle" (1881-1886) also follows an essentially topological approach.  See Kline, MT, pp.732ff., 1170ff.  74 Poincare, YS, pp.59f.; OP, pp.132ff.  7S Poincare, OP, p.134. We say, today, that two figures F, G (belonging to the same or  to different topological spaces) are topologically equivalent if there is a continuous  bijection f: F-+G whose inverse r1 is also continuous. This concept is wider than the  one proposed by Poincare in OP. It should be noted, however, that the name  homeomorphism given today to such bijections as f was introduced by Poincare.

S is metrizable if  there exists a distance function d: S x S~R such that for every x in S and every r in R,  the 'open ball' {y lyE Sand d(x, y) < r} is open in S. Distance functions were defined in  Part 2.2, Note 36 (p.384).  86 A topological space S is normal if (i) S is T,-separable (Le. if for every pair of points  x, yES there is a neighbourhood X of x and a neighbourhood Y of y such that y.t X  and x.t Y); (ii) for each pair of disjoint closed sets A and B of S there exist disjoint  open sets U and V of S such that A C U and B C V. A normal space S is totally normal  if every subspace of S is normally situated in S, that is, if every A C S satisfies the  following requirements: for every open set U of S which contains A there exists an  open set G such that A C G C U; G is the union of a family (Gi)iEl of open sets of S,  each of which is the union of a countable family of closed sets of S, and each x E G has  a neighbourhood which intersects only a finite number of members of the family  (GJiEl'  87 Lebesgue's comments are contained in a letter to O. Blumenthal and were published  in Mathematische Annalen, Vo1.70, right after Brouwer's proof. Their main purpose  was to show that Brouwer's result could be demonstrated in a simpler way. Lebesgue's  argument, however, is unsatisfactory.  NOTE ADDED IN PROOF. Randall R. Dipert, in a recent article about "Peirce's theory of  the geometrical structure of physical space" (Isis, 68 (1977) 404-413), quotes a fragment,  written c.1893, in which Peirce argues that physical space can hardly be Euclidean. "It is  now agreed _. Peirce says -that there is no reason whatever to think the sum of the three  angles of a triangle precisely equal to 180 degrees. [ ... J There is an infinite number of  different possible values, of which 180 degrees is only one; so that the probability is as 1 to  00 or 0 to 1, that the value is just 180 degrees. In other words, it seems for the present  impossible to suppose the postulates of geometry precisely true." (Peirce, Collected  Papers, L131.) While Peirce's argument from probability is presumably original and  compares very favourably with the statistical non sequitur we detected in Erdmann  (p.267), the claim to which it lends support follows immediately from a passage in  Riemann's lecture of \854, as we noted on pp.104f. As a matter of fact, the empirical  falsehood of the principles of geometry had been proclaimed by John Stuart Mill in his  System of Logic (quoted on p.257), and had been forcefully expressed by Joseph Delboeuf  in the Revue Philosophique for 1893 (quoted on p.300). I cannot therefore subscribe to R.R.  Dipert's statement that "among scientifically oriented philosophers writing in the second  half of the nineteenth century, Peirce was alone in maintaining that [physical] space </p><div id="pagenum"><p>cannot be Euclidean."
