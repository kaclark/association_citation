Man and the Sea,Always* unfettered man* you will cherish the sea!\nThe sea your mirror* you look into your mind\nIn its eternal billows surging without end*\nAnd as its gulfs are bitter* so must your spirit be\n\nYou plunge into Joy with this image of your own:\nYou hug it with your eyes and arms; your heart\nForgets for a time its noisy beat* becomes a part\nOf a greater* more savage and less tameable moan.\n\nIn your own ways* you both are brooding and discrete:\nMan* no one has mapped your chasms hidden floor*\nOh sea* no one knows your innermost riches* for\nYour jealousy hides secrets no one can repeat.\n\nAs the uncounted swarm of creatures gathers\nYou two have fought without pity or remorse* both\nFrom sheer love of the slaughter and of death*\nOh* eternal wrestlers* oh* relentless brothers!
