  PREFACE TO THE "DIVINE NAMES."

   THE Treatise on "Divine Names" was written by Dionysius, at the request
   of Timothy, and at the instigation of Hierotheus, to express, in a form
   more easily understood, the more abstract Treatise of Hierotheus, who
   was his chief instructor after St. Paul. Its purpose is to explain the
   epithets in Holy Scripture applied alike to the whole Godhead--Father,
   Son, and Holy Ghost. It does not pretend to describe the unrevealed
   God, Who is beyond expression and conception, and can only be known
   through that union with God, "by which we know, even as we are known."
   Holy Scripture is the sole authority, beyond which we must neither
   think nor speak of Almighty God. The Treatise, being written by one of
   the most learned Greeks, the phraseology is, naturally, that of Plato
   and Aristotle ; but Plato and Aristotle are not authorities here. When
   Plato treated his Hebrew instructor with such reverence, and was so
   versed in the Pentateuch, we need not be sensitive as to the admission
   of Plato's authority. But, as a matter of fact, on the question of
   Exemplars [2] and some other points, the opinions of Plato are
   expressly refuted. The phrase of Luther, "Platonising, rather than
   Christianising," proves only a very meagre acquaintance with Dionysius.
   The Greek language is moulded in a marvellous manner to express the
   newly revealed Christian Faith in its most exalted form, in a style
   which Daillé confesses to be always of the same "colour;" and Pearson,
   "always like itself." Jahn has followed Dionysius step by step in order
   to trace the connection between the language of Plato and Dionysius,
   for the purpose of exploding the puerile supposition that such complex
   writings as these could have been evolved from the elementary treatises
   of Proclus and Plotinus. Most probably, some of the lost writings of
   Dionysius are in part preserved in those writers and in Clement of
   Alexandria; but Dionysius is the Master, not Pupil! The works are very
   distinct and precise upon the Divinity of Christ, and the Hypostatic
   Union. Like St. Paul, Dionysius affirms that He, Who made all things,
   is God; and further that Jesus is God, by some startling phraseology.
   He speaks of James, "the Lord's brother [3] ," as "brother of God"
   David, from whom was born Christ after the flesh, is called "father of
   God [4] ." When speaking of the entombment of the Blessed Virgin, he
   speaks of her body as the "Life-springing" and "God-receptive body;"
   thus testifying that Jesus, born of a pure Virgin, is Life and God. He
   describes the miracles of Jesus as being, as it were, the new and
   God-incarnate energy of God become Man. The newly-coined words indicate
   an original thinker moulding the Greek language to a newly acquired
   faith. There are two words, "Agnosia" and "Divine Gloom," which
   illustrate a principle running through these writings,--that the
   negative of abstraction denotes the superlative positive. "Divine
   Gloom" is the darkness from excessive light; "Agnosia" is neither
   ignorance nor knowledge intensified: but a supra-knowledge of Him, Who
   is above all things known. It is "the most Divine knowledge of Almighty
   God, within the union beyond mind, when the mind, having stood apart
   from all existing things, and then, having dismissed itself, has been
   united to the superluminous rays--thence and there, being illuminated
   by the unsearchable wisdom." In the Mystic Theology, Dionysius exhorts
   Timothy thus,--"But, thou, O dear Timothy, leave behind both sensible
   perception, and intellectual efforts, and all objects of sense and
   intelligence; and all things being and not being, and be raised aloft
   as far as attainable, agnostos--unknowingly [5] ,--to the union with
   Him above every essence and knowledge. For by the resistless and
   absolute ecstacy from thyself, in all purity, thou wilt be carried high
   to the superessential ray of the Divine darkness, when thou hast cast
   away all, and become liberated from all." Thus, we must pass beyond all
   things known, and all things being, and lie passive under the
   illuminating ray of God, if we would attain the highest conception of
   Him, "Who passeth all understanding." God "unknown" is still the God of
   Dionysius, and He is still to be worshipped unknowingly. There is a
   tradition that Dionysius erected the altar in Athens "to God unknown,"
   as author of the inexplicable darkness, which he observed in Egypt, and
   found afterwards from St. Paul to have been contemporaneous with the
   Crucifixion. Did St. Paul adapt his discourse at Athens to the
   conversion of Dionysius?

   The only heresiarch, whom Dionysius mentions by name, is Elymas, the
   Sorcerer, Simon Magus, a man of great intellectual attainments and a
   considerable author. Flavius Clemens and Eugenius, Bishop of Toledo,
   were disciples of Simon before their conversion to Christ. The tenets
   of Elymas are described by Hippolytus. He formed an eclectic system
   from the Old Testament and the Christian Faith, and with Cerinthus and
   Carpocrates originated many heresies to which the apostolic epistles
   allude, and which in later times became prominent in the Church. In
   refuting these heresies, by manifestation of the truth, Dionysius
   anticipated many errors--ancient and modern.

   Jerome informs us (Scr. Ecc. 46) that Pantaenus [6] , one of the most
   celebrated Christian philosophers of Alexandria, was sent, A.D. 193, by
   Demetrius, Bishop of that city, to India, at the request of a
   delegation from India for that purpose. Pantaenus discovered, on his
   arrival, that St. Bartholomew (one of the twelve) had preached the
   coming of Jesus Christ, in that country. Pantaenus found a copy of the
   Hebrew Gospel of St. Matthew in India. Now, by the extract, contained
   in the Scholia of Maximus, from the Scholia of Dionysius of Alexandria
   (250) upon the Divine Names, and also by the extract from a letter of
   the same Dionysius, recently discovered in the British Museum [7] (Nos.
   12151-2), we know that the writings of Dionysius the Areopagite were
   known and treasured in Alexandria a few years after the death of
   Pantaenus. Can we reasonably doubt that Pantaenus took the writings of
   Dionysius, and the more abstract works of Hierotheus, to India? Have we
   not here an explanation of the remarkable similarity between the Hindu
   philosophy, as expressed by Sankara [8] in the eighth, and Râmânuja in
   the thirteenth century, and the "Divine Names?" Sankara treats of the
   Supreme as "absolutely One;" Râmânuja as "non-dual, with
   qualification." Both these truths are combined and expressed in
   Dionysius.

   I cannot but believe that many of the beautiful expressions about
   Vishnu, the Redeemer, in the Râmâyana of Tulsidâs are Christian Truths
   under a Hindu dress [9] . Many learned Hindus affirm that it is
   needless for them to become Christian, because they have a more exalted
   conception of the Supreme God than Christians themselves. I submit that
   the "Divine Names" will be instrumental in bringing India to the
   Christian Faith, in the best and only effectual way--by communities and
   not by individuals--through the most learned and devout, and not
   through the most ignorant.

   Dionysius was first converted, and then, through him, those who
   naturally and properly followed his lead.

   LUCIUS FLAVIUS DEXTER.

   Dexter was a friend of Jerome. Jerome even addresses him as "filius
   amicus," and describes him as "clarus apud saeculum et Christi fidei
   deditus."

   Dexter became Prefect of the Pretorian Oriental Guards, and was one of
   the most illustrious statesmen of his time. He resided two years in
   Toledo. From the archives of the Church of Toledo and other cities he
   compiled a chronicle from A.D. 1 to A.D. 430, giving a brief summary of
   the Church events in Spain. That chronicle he dedicated to Jerome, who,
   enrolled both Chronicle and Author amongst his "illustrious men." It
   was at the request of Dexter that Jerome wrote his book on
   Ecclesiastical Writers. Among the earliest Bishops of Toledo, Dexter
   describes a remarkable man,--Marcellus,--surnamed Eugenius, on account
   of his noble birth.

   Bivarius says he was of the house and family of Caesar, being uncle to
   the Emperor Hadrian. Marcellus was consecrated Bishop by Dionysius the
   Areopagite at Aries, and sent to Toledo. Respecting him, Dexter records
   that Dionysius dedicated the books of the Divine Names to him, u.c.
   851, A.D. 98. Dexter further records that Dionysius surnamed Marcellus,
   Timothy, on account of his excellent disposition. Polycrates, Bishop of
   Ephesus, relates that Timothy, Bishop of Ephesus, to whom the works of
   Dionysius were originally dedicated, was martyred during the reign of
   Nerva, A.D. 96-97. Upon the return of Dionysius to Gaul, after his
   visit to St. John, released from Patmos, we find him calling his friend
   Marcellus, Timothy, and presenting the books of the "Divine Names "to
   him, A.D. 98; in order that he might still have a Timothy on earth,--
   "in vivis"--although his first Timothy, "migravit ad Christum," A.D.
   97.

   This touch of nature, preserved in a chronicle, written more than 1400
   years ago, by an illustrious statesman, who was son of a Bishop
   celebrated for learning and sanctity, may fairly be deemed, by an
   unprejudiced mind, reasonable proof that the "Divine Names" were
   written previous to A.D. 98.

   N.B. As the result of some research I affirm that our Saviour's last
   commission is the Key to Church history in the first century. As He
   commanded the Apostles to preach the Gospel throughout the world, so
   the Gospel was preached when St. Paul wrote his Epistle to the
   Colossians, Chap. I. v. 23 (tou keruchthentos en pase ktisei), and with
   such success amongst the most learned and noble, that, but for the
   cruel massacre of Flavius [10] Clemens and his family for the Christian
   Faith, there would have been a Christian Emperor in the first century.
   As Jesus said, "Ye shall be witnesses of Me unto the uttermost parts of
   the earth" (Acts Chap. 1. v. 8), so the Apostles planted the Church of
   Christ in Gaul, Spain and Britain, with its threefold ministry; and by
   the end of the second century there was an organised Church throughout
   each of those territories [11] .

   Dr. Schneider informs me "that in Germany they now admit that the
   external proofs are in favour of genuineness of Dionysius, but they
   confine themselves to the internal proofs. They pretend that the
   doctrine is too clear and precise to have been written in the apostolic
   age."

   How could the chief Areopagite, the convert and companion of St. Paul,
   and the familiar friend of St. John, Theologus, have understood
   theology!!

  CAPUT I.

   TO MY FELLOW PRESBYTER, TIMOTHY,
   DIONYSIUS THE PRESBYTER.

   What is the purpose of the discourse, and what the tradition concerning
   Divine Names.

   SECTION I.

   Now then, O Blessed One, after the Theological Outlines [12] , I will
   pass to the interpretation of the Divine Names, as best I can.

   But, let the rule of the Oracles be here also prescribed for us, viz.,
   that we shall establish the truth of the things spoken concerning God,
   not in the persuasive words of man's wisdom, but in demonstration of
   the Spirit-moved power of the Theologians, by aid of which we are
   brought into contact with things unutterable and unknown, in a manner
   unutterable and unknown, in proportion to the superior union of the
   reasoning and intuitive faculty and operation within us. By no means
   then is it permitted to speak, or even to think, anything, concerning
   the superessential and hidden Deity, beyond those things divinely
   revealed to us in the sacred Oracles [13] . For Agnosia,
   (supra-knowledge) of its superessentiality above reason and mind and
   essence--to, it must we attribute the superessential science, so far
   aspiring to the Highest, as the ray of the supremely Divine Oracles
   imparts itself, whilst we restrain ourselves in our approach to the
   higher glories by prudence and piety as regards things Divine. For, if
   we must place any confidence in the All Wise and most trustworthy
   Theology, things Divine are revealed and contemplated in proportion to
   the capacity of each of the minds, since the supremely Divine Goodness
   distributes Divinely its immeasurableness (as that which cannot be
   contained) with a justice which preserves those whose capacity is
   limited. For, as things intelligible cannot be comprehended and
   contemplated by things of sense, and things uncompounded and unformed
   by things compounded and formed; and the intangible and unshaped
   formlessness of things without body, by those formed according to the
   shapes of bodies; in accordance with the self-same analogy of the
   truth, the superessential Illimitability is placed above things
   essential, and the Unity above mind above the Minds; and the One above
   conception is inconceivable to all conceptions; and the Good above word
   is unutterable by word--Unit making one every unit, and superessential
   essence and mind inconceivable, and Word unutterable, speechlessness
   [14] and inconception [15] , and namelessness--being after the manner
   of no existing being, and Cause of being to all, but Itself not being,
   as beyond every essence, and as It may manifest Itself properly and
   scientifically concerning Itself.

   SECTION II.

   Concerning this then, as has been said, the superessential and hidden
   Deity, it is not permitted to speak or even to think beyond the things
   divinely revealed to us in the sacred Oracles. For even as Itself has
   taught (as becomes Its goodness) in the Oracles, the science and
   contemplation of Itself in Its essential Nature is beyond the reach of
   all created things, as towering superessentially above all. And you
   will find many of the Theologians, who have celebrated It, not only as
   invisible and incomprehensible, but also as inscrutable and
   untraceable, since there is no trace of those who have penetrated to
   Its hidden infinitude. The Good indeed is not entirely uncommunicated
   to any single created being, but benignly sheds forth its
   superessential ray, persistently fixed in Itself, by illuminations
   analogous to each several being, and elevates to Its permitted
   contemplation and communion and likeness, those holy minds, who, as far
   as is lawful and reverent, strive after It, and who are neither
   impotently boastful towards that which is higher than the harmoniously
   imparted Divine manifestation, nor, in regard to a lower level, lapse
   downward through their inclining to the worse, but who elevate
   themselves determinately and unwaveringly to the ray shining upon them;
   and, by their proportioned love of permitted illuminations, are
   elevated with a holy reverence, prudently and piously, as on new wings.

   SECTION III.

   Following then, these, the supremely Divine standards, which also
   govern the whole holy ranks of the supercelestial orders,--whilst
   honouring the unrevealed of the Godhead which is beyond mind and
   matter, with inscrutable and holy reverence of mind, and things
   unutterable, with a prudent silence, we elevate ourselves to the
   glories which illuminate us in the sacred Oracles, and are led by their
   light to the supremely Divine Hymns, by which we are supermundanely
   enlightened and moulded to the sacred Songs of Praise, so as both to
   see the supremely Divine illuminations given to us by them, according
   to our capacities, and to praise the good-giving Source of every holy
   manifestation of light, as Itself has taught concerning Itself in the
   sacred Oracles. For instance, that It is cause and origin and essence
   and life of all things; and even of those who fall away from It, both
   recalling and resurrection; and of those who have lapsed to the
   perversion of the Divine likeness, renewal and reformation; of those
   who are tossed about in a sort of irreligious unsteadiness, a religious
   stability; of those who have continued to stand, steadfastness; of
   those who are being conducted to It, a protecting Conductor; of those
   being illuminated, illumination; of those being perfected, source of
   perfection; of those being deified, source of deification; of those
   being simplified, simplification; of those being unified, unity; of
   every origin superessentially super-original origin; and of the Hidden,
   as far as is right, beneficent communication; and, in one word, the
   life of the living, and essence of things that be; of all life and
   essence, origin and cause; because Its goodness produces and sustains
   things that be, in their being.

   SECTION IV.

   These things we have learned from the Divine Oracles, and you will find
   all the sacred Hymnology, so to speak, of the Theologians arranging the
   Names, of God with a view to make known and praise the beneficent
   progressions of the Godhead. Hence, we see in almost every theological
   treatise the Godhead religiously celebrated, both as Monad and unity,
   on account of the simplicity and oneness of Its supernatural
   indivisibility from which, as an unifying power, we are unified, and
   when our divided diversities have been folded together, in a manner
   supermundane, we are collected into a godlike unit and
   divinely-imitated union; but, also as Triad, on account of the
   tri-personal manifestation of the superessential productiveness, from
   which all paternity in heaven and on earth is, and is named; also, as
   cause of things existing, since all things were brought into being on
   account of Its creative goodness, both wise and good, because all
   things, whilst preserving the properties of their own nature
   unimpaired, are filled with every inspired harmony and holy comeliness,
   but pre-eminently, as loving towards man, because It truly and wholly
   shared, in one of Its Persons (subsistencies), in things belonging to
   us, recalling to Itself and replacing the human extremity, out of
   which, in a manner unutterable, the simplex Jesus was composed, and the
   Everlasting took a temporal duration, and He, Who is superessentially
   exalted above every rank throughout all nature, became within our
   nature, whilst retaining the unchangeable and unconfused steadfastness
   of His own properties. And whatever other divinely-wrought
   illuminations, conformable to the Oracles, the secret tradition of our
   inspired leaders bequeathed to us for our enlightenment, in these also
   we have been initiated; now indeed, according to our capacity, through
   the sacred veils of the loving-kindness towards man, made known in the
   Oracles and hierarchical traditions, which envelop things intellectual
   in things sensible, and things superessential in things that are; and
   place forms and shapes around the formless and shapeless, and multiply
   and fashion the supernatural and formless simplicity in the variedness
   of the divided symbols; but, then, when we have become incorruptible
   and immortal, and have reached the Christlike and most blessed repose,
   according to the Divine saying, we shall be "ever with the Lord,"
   fulfilled, through all-pure contemplations, with the visible
   manifestation of God covering us with glory, in most brilliant
   splendours, as the disciples in the most Divine Transfiguration, and
   participating in His gift of spiritual light, with unimpassioned and
   immaterial mind; and, even in the union beyond conception, through the
   agnostic and most blessed efforts after rays of surpassing brilliancy,
   in a more Divine imitation of the supercelestial minds. For we shall be
   equal to the angels, as the truth of the Oracles affirms, and sons of
   God, being sons of the resurrection. But now, to the best of our
   ability, we use symbols appropriate to things Divine, and from these
   again we elevate ourselves, according to our degree, to the simple and
   unified truth of the spiritual visions; and after our every conception
   of things godlike, laying aside our mental energies, we cast ourselves,
   to the best of our ability, towards the superessential ray, in which
   all the terms of every kind of knowledge pre-existed in a manner beyond
   expression, which it is neither possible to conceive nor express, nor
   entirely in any way to contemplate, on account of Its being
   pre-eminently above all things, and super-unknown, and Its having
   previously contained within Itself, superessentially, the whole
   perfections of all kinds of essential knowledge and power, and Its
   being firmly fixed by Its absolute power, above all, even the
   supercelestial minds. For, if all kinds of knowledge are of things
   existing, and are limited to things existing, that, beyond all essence,
   is also elevated above all knowledge.

   SECTION V.

   And yet, if It is superior to every expression and every knowledge, and
   is altogether placed above mind and essence,--being such as embraces
   and unites and comprehends and anticipates all things, but Itself is
   altogether incomprehensible to all, and of It, there is neither
   perception nor imagination, nor surmise, nor name, nor expression, nor
   contact, nor science;--in what way can our treatise thoroughly
   investigate the meaning of the Divine Names, when the superessential
   Deity is shewn to be without Name, and above Name?

   But, as we said when we put forth the Theological Outlines, it is not
   possible either to express or to conceive what the One, the Unknown,
   the Superessential self-existing Good is,--I mean the threefold Unity,
   the alike God, and the alike Good. But even the unions, such as befit
   angels, of the holy Powers, whether we must call them efforts after, or
   receptions from, the super-Unknown and surpassing Goodness, are both
   unutterable and unknown, and exist in those angels alone who, above
   angelic knowledge, are deemed worthy of them. The godlike minds (men)
   made one by these unions, through imitation of angels as far as
   attainable (since it is during cessation of every mental energy that
   such an union as this of the deified minds towards the super-divine
   light takes place) celebrate It most appropriately through the
   abstraction of all created things--enlightened in this matter, truly
   and super-naturally from the most blessed union towards It--that It is
   Cause Indeed of all things existing, but Itself none of them, as being
   superessentially elevated above all. To none, indeed, who are lovers of
   the Truth above all Truth, is it permitted to celebrate the
   supremely-Divine Essentiality--that which is the super-subsistence of
   the super-goodness,--neither as word or power, neither as mind or life
   or essence, but as pre-eminently separated from every condition,
   movement, life, imagination, surmise, name, word, thought, conception,
   essence, position, stability, union, boundary, infinitude, all things
   whatever. But since, as sustaining source of goodness, by the very fact
   of Its being, It is cause of all things that be, from all created
   things must we celebrate the benevolent Providence of the Godhead; for
   all things are both around It and for It, and It is before all things,
   and all things in It consist, and by Its being is the production and
   sustenance of the whole, and all things aspire to It--the intellectual
   and rational, by means of knowledge--things inferior to these, through
   the senses, and other things by living movement, or substantial and
   habitual aptitude.

   SECTION VI.

   The theologians, having knowledge of this, celebrate It, both without
   Name and from every Name. Without name, as when they say that the
   Godhead Itself, in one of those mystical apparitions of the symbolical
   Divine manifestation, rebuked him who said, "What is thy name?" and as
   leading him away from all knowledge of the Divine Name, said this, "and
   why dost thou ask my Name? "and this (Name) "is wonderful," And is not
   this in reality the wonderful Name, that which is above every Name--the
   Nameless--that fixed above every name which is named, whether in this
   age or in that which is to come? Also, as "many named," as when they
   again introduce It as saying, "I am He, Who is--the Life--the
   Light--the God--the Truth." And when the wise of God themselves
   celebrate Him, as Author of all things, under many Names, from all
   created things--as Good--as Beautiful--as Wise--as Beloved--as God of
   gods--as Lord of lords--as Holy of Holies--as Eternal--as Being--as
   Author of Ages--as Provider of Life--as Wisdom--as Mind--as Word--as
   Knowing--as preeminently possessing all the treasures of all
   knowledge--as Power--as Powerful--as King of kings--as Ancient of
   days--as never growing old--and Unchangeable--as Preservation--as
   Righteousness--as Sanctification -- as Redemption--as surpassing all
   things in greatness--and as in a gentle breeze.--Yea, they also say
   that He is in minds, and in souls, and in bodies, and in heaven and in
   earth, and at once, the same in the same--in the world--around the
   world--above the world--supercelestial, superessential, sun,
   star--fire--water--spirit--dew--cloud--self-hewn stone and rock--all
   things existing--and not one of things existing.

   SECTION VII.

   Thus, then, the "Nameless "befits the cause of all, which is also above
   all, as do all the names of things existing, in order that there may be
   strictly a kingly rule over the whole; and that all things may be
   around It and dependent upon It, as cause, as beginning, as end. And
   Itself, according to the Divine saying, may be the "all in all," and
   truly sung as of all, producing, directing and perfecting and
   sustaining guard, and shrine, and turning towards Itself, and that
   uniformly, irresistibly and pre-eminently. For It is not only cause of
   sustenance, or life, or perfection,--so that from this or that
   forethought alone the Goodness above Name should be named, but It
   previously embraced in Itself all things existing, absolutely and
   without limit, by the complete benefactions of His one and all-creating
   forethought, and by all created things in joint accord It is celebrated
   and named.

   SECTION VIII.

   Further also, the Theologians do not honour alone the Names of God
   which are given from universal or particular Providences, or objects of
   His forethought; but also from certain occasional Divine Visions, in
   the sacred temples or elsewhere, which enlightened the initiated or the
   Prophets, they name the surpassing bright Goodness which is above Name,
   after one or other causes and powers, and clothe It in forms and shapes
   of man, or fire, or electron, and celebrate Its eyes and ears, and
   locks of hair, and countenance, and hands, and back, and wings, and
   arms, and hinder parts and feet. Also they assign to It crowns [16] and
   seats, and drinking vessels and bowls, and certain other things
   mystical, concerning which, in our Symbolic Theology, we will speak as
   best we can. But now, collecting from the Oracles so much as serves the
   purpose of our present treatise, and using the things aforesaid, as a
   kind of Canon, and keeping our eyes upon them, let us advance to the
   unfolding of the Names of God, which fall within the range of our
   understanding, and, what the hierarchical rule always teaches us
   throughout every phase of theology, let us become initiated (to speak
   authoritatively) in the godlike contemplations with a god-enlightened
   conception. And let us bring religious ears to the unfoldings of the
   Holy Names of God, implanting the Holy in the Holy, according to the
   Divine tradition, and removing it from the laughter and jeers of the
   uninitiated; yea, rather, if certain men really are such, purifying
   them from their fighting against God in this matter. Be it thine, then,
   to guard these things, O excellent Timothy, according to the most holy
   leading, and to make the things Divine neither spoken nor known to the
   uninitiated. For myself, may Almighty God give me to celebrate, in a
   manner worthy of God, the numerous beneficent Names of the uncalled and
   unnamed Deity; and may He not take away a word of truth from my mouth.

  CAPUT II.

   Concerning common and distinctive theology, and what is the Divine
   Union and distinction.

   SECTION I.

   LET then the self-existent Goodness be sung from the Oracles as
   defining and manifesting the whole supremely-Divine-Subsistence in its
   essential nature. For, what else is there to learn from the sacred
   theology, when it affirms that the Godhead Itself, leading the way,
   says, "Why dost thou ask me concerning the Good?--None is Good except
   God alone." Now, this, we have thoroughly demonstrated elsewhere, that
   always, all the God-becoming Names of God, are celebrated by the
   Oracles, not partitively, but as applied to the whole and entire and
   complete and full Godhead, and that all of them are referred
   impartitively, absolutely, unreservedly, entirely, to all the Entirety
   of the entirely complete and every Deity. And verily as we have
   mentioned in the Theological Outlines, if any one should say that this
   is not spoken concerning the whole Deity, he blasphemes, and dares,
   without right, to cleave asunder the super-unified Unity.

   We must affirm, then, that this is to be received respecting the whole
   Deity. For even the essentially Good Word Himself said, "I am Good [17]
   ." And a certain one of the God-rapt Prophets celebrates the Spirit as
   "the Good [18] ." And again this, "I am He, Who is [19] ." If they
   shall say that this is said, not of the whole Deity, but should
   violently limit it to one part, how will they understand this? "These
   things, saith He, Who is, Who was, Who is to come, the Almighty [20] ,"
   and "Thou art the same [21] ," and this, "Spirit of truth, which is,
   which proceedeth from the Father [22] ." And if they say that the
   supremely Divine Life is not coextensive with the whole, how is the
   sacred Word true which said, "As the Father raiseth the dead and maketh
   alive, so also the Son maketh alive whom He will [23] ," and that "the
   Spirit is He, Who maketh alive [24] ?" But, that the whole Deity holds
   the Lordship over the whole, one can scarcely say, as I think how many
   times, in reference to the Paternal Deity, or the Filial, the word
   "Lord "is repeated in the Word of God, as applied to Father and Son
   [25] . But the Spirit also is Lord [26] . And "the beautiful and the
   wise" are also sung respecting the whole Deity. And the light, and the
   deifying, and the cause, and whatever pertains to the whole Godhead,
   the Oracles introduce into all the supremely Divine
   hymnody--collectively, when they say "all things are from Almighty God;
   "but, specifically, as when they say, "all things were made through Him
   and to Him," and "all things in Him consist," and "Thou shalt send
   forth Thy Spirit, and they shall be made." And, that one may speak
   summarily, the supremely Divine Word Himself said, "I and the Father
   are One," and "all that the Father hath are Mine," and, "All Mine are
   Thine, and Thine, Mine." And again, whatever pertains to the Father and
   Himself, He attributes. to the supremely Divine Spirit, collectively
   and in common--the works of God--the homage, the fontal and ceaseless
   cause and the distribution of the goodly gifts. And I think, none of
   those, who have been nourished in the Divine Oracles with unprejudiced
   conceptions, will oppose this, that all things befitting God belong to
   the whole Godhead, according to the divinely perfect Word. Since, then,
   we have demonstrated and defined these things from the Oracles,--here
   indeed partially, but elsewhere sufficiently--we will undertake to
   unfold every Divine Name whatsoever, which is to be received as
   referring to the whole Deity.

   SECTION II.

   But if any one should say that we introduce in so doing a confusion, in
   disparagement of the distinction which befits God, we do not think that
   such a statement as this is itself sufficient to convince that it is
   true. For, if there is any one who has placed himself entirely in
   opposition to the Oracles, he will be also entirely apart from our.
   philosophy; and, if he has no care for the divine Wisdom of the
   Oracles, how shall we care for his guidance to the theological science?
   But, if he regards the truth of the Oracles, we also, using this canon
   and illumination, will advance unwaveringly to the answer, as best we
   can, by affirming that theology transmits some things as common, but
   others as distinctive; and neither is it meet to divide the common, nor
   to confuse the distinctive; but that following It according to our
   ability, we ought to rise to the Divine splendours; for, by taking
   thence the Divine revelations, as a most excellent canon of truth, we
   strive to guard the things lying there, in their native simplicity and
   integrity and identity--being ourselves guarded in our guard of the
   Oracles, and from these receiving strength to guard those who guard
   them.

   SECTION III.

   The (Names) then, common to the whole Deity, as we have demonstrated
   from the Oracles, by many instances in the Theological Outlines, are
   the Super-Good, the Super-God, the Super-essential, the Super-Living,
   the Super-Wise, and whatever else belongs to the superlative
   abstraction; with which also, all those denoting Cause, the Good, the
   Beautiful, the Being, the Life-producing, the Wise, and whatever Names
   are given to the Cause of all Good, from His goodly gifts. But the
   distinctive Names are the superessential name and property of Father,
   and Son and Spirit, since no interchange or community in these is in
   any way introduced. But there is a further distinction, viz., the
   complete and unaltered existence of Jesus amongst us, and all the
   mysteries of love towards man actually existing within it.

   SECTION IV.

   But it is rather necessary, I suppose, to resume and to set forth the
   complete fashion of the Divine union and distinction, in order that the
   whole discourse may be seen at a glance to reject everything ambiguous
   and indistinct, and to define critically and distinctly the proper
   Names, as far as possible. For, as I said elsewhere, the sacred
   instructors of our theological tradition call the "Divine Unions" the
   hidden and unrevealed sublimities of the super-unutterable and
   super-unknown Isolation; but the "distinctions," the goodly
   progressions and manifestations of the Godhead; and, following the
   sacred Oracles, they mention also properties of the aforesaid "Union;
   "and again of the distinction, that there are certain specific unions
   and distinctions. For example, with regard to the Divine Union, that
   is, the Superessentiality, there is kindred and common to the
   One-springing Triad, the superessential sustaining Source, the
   super-Divine Deity, the super-good Goodness, the supreme identity of
   the whole supreme Idiosyncrasy, the Oneness above source of one; the
   Unspeakable; the Much-speaking, the Agnosia, the Comprehended by all,
   the Placing of all, the Abstraction of all, that which is above all
   affirmation and abstraction, the abiding and steadfastness in each
   other, if I may so speak, wholly super-united and in no part commingled
   of the One-springing Persons, just as lights of lamps (to use sensible
   illustrations familiar to our capacity), when in one house, are both
   wholly distinct in each other throughout, and keep the distinction from
   each other specifically and perfectly maintained, being one in
   distinction and distinct in union; and then, indeed, we may see in a
   house, in which are many lamps, the lights of all united to form one
   certain light and lighting up one combined radiance; and, as I suppose,
   no one would be able to distinguish in the air containing all the
   lights the light of one or other lamp from the rest, and to see one
   without the other, since whole in whole are mixed together without
   being mingled. But, if any one were to take out from the chamber one
   particular burner, the whole light belonging to it will depart with it;
   no particle of the other lights being drawn along with it, nor any of
   its own light left with the other. For there was, as I said, the
   complete union of all with all, unmingled throughout, and in no part
   confused, and this actually in a body, the air, the light even itself
   being dependent on the material fire. Whence we affirm that the
   superessential Union is fixed above not only the unions in bodies, but
   also above those in souls themselves, and in minds themselves, which,
   in a manner unmingled and supermundane, the Godlike and supercelestial
   Illuminations, whole through whole, possess, as beseems a participation
   analogous to those who participate in the Union elevated above all.

   SECTION V.

   But there is a distinction in the superessential nomenclature of God,
   not only that which I have mentioned, namely, that each of the
   One-springing Persons is fixed in the union itself, unmingled and
   unconfused; but also that the properties of the superessential Divine
   Production are not convertible in regard to one another. The Father is
   sole Fountain of the superessential Deity, since the Father is not Son,
   nor the Son, Father; since the hymns reverently guard their own
   characteristics for each of the supremely Divine Persons. These then
   are the unions and distinctions within the unutterable Union and
   sustaining Source. But, if the goodly progression of the Divine Union,
   multiplying itself super-uniquely through Goodness, and taking to
   itself many forms, is also a Divine distinction, yet, common within the
   Divine distinction, are the resistless distributions, the
   substance-giving, the life-giving, the wise-making, and the other gifts
   of the Goodness, Cause of all, after which from the participations and
   those participating are celebrated the things imparticipatively
   participated. And this is kindred and common, and one, to the whole
   Divinity, that it is all entire, participated by each of the
   Participants, and by none partially. Just as a point in a circle's
   centre participates in all the circumjacent [27] straight lines in the
   circle, and as many impressions of a seal participate in the archetypal
   seal, and in each of the impressions the seal is whole and the same,
   and in none partial in any respect. But superior to these is the
   impartibility of the Deity--Cause of all--from the fact that there is
   no contact with it. Nor has it any commingled communion with the things
   participating.

   SECTION VI.

   And yet some one might say the seal is not whole and the same in the
   images throughout. But of this the seal is not the cause, for it
   imparts itself all and the same to each; but the difference of the
   recipients makes the figures dissimilar, since the archetype is one and
   complete and the same. For instance, if the wax were soft and
   impressionable, and smooth and unstamped, and neither unimpressionable
   and hard, nor running and dissolving, it will have the figure clear and
   sharp and fixed. But if it should lack any of the aforesaid aptitudes,
   this will be the cause of the non-participative and un-figured and
   indistinct, and whatever else arises from inaptitude for reception.
   Further, there is a distinction from the goodly work of God towards us,
   in that the superessential Word was invested with being amongst
   us--from us--wholly and truly, and did and suffered whatever things are
   choice and pre-eminent in His human work of God. For in these, the
   Father and the Spirit in no respect communicated, except perhaps, one
   might say, as regards the benign and philanthropic purpose, and as
   regards all the pre-eminent and unutterable work of God which the
   unchangeable, qua God and Word of God, did when He had been born
   amongst us. Thus we, too, strive to unite and distinguish in the Word
   the things Divine, as the things Divine themselves, are united and
   distinguished.

   SECTION VII.

   Now we have set forth in the Theological Outlines whatever Divine
   Causes we have found in the Oracles, of these unions, and distinctions,
   by treating each separately, according to our ability; by explaining
   some things, by the infallible Word, and unfolding them; and by
   conducting the religious and unpolluted mind to the bright visions of
   the Oracles; but others, as being full of mystery, by approaching them
   according to the Divine tradition, which is superior to mental energy.
   For all the Divine properties, even those revealed to us, are known by
   the participations alone; and themselves, such as they are in their own
   source and abode, are above mind and all essence and knowledge. For
   instance, if we have named the superessential Hiddenness, God, or Life,
   or Essence, or Light, or Word (logos), we have no other thought than
   that the powers brought to us from It are deifying, or essentiating, or
   life-bearing, or wisdom-imparting; but to Itself we approach during the
   cessation of all the intellectual energies, seeing no deification, or
   life, or essence whatever, such as is strictly like the Cause
   pre-eminently elevated above all. Again, that the Father is fontal
   Deity, but the Lord Jesus and the Spirit are, if one may so speak,
   God-planted shoots, and as it were Flowers and superessential Lights of
   the God-bearing Deity, we have received from the holy Oracles; but how
   these things are, it is neither possible to say, nor to conceive.

   SECTION VIII.

   But. up to this point, our utmost power of mental energy carries us,
   namely, that all divine paternity and sonship have been bequeathed from
   the Source of paternity and Source of sonship--pre-eminent above
   all--both to us and to the supercelestial powers, from which the
   godlike become both gods, and sons of gods, and fathers of gods, and
   are named Minds, such a paternity and sonship being of course
   accomplished spiritually, i.e. incorporeally, immaterially,
   intellectually,-- since the supremely Divine Spirit is seated above all
   intellectual immateriality, and deification, and the Father and the Son
   are pre-eminently elevated above all divine paternity and sonship. For
   there is no strict likeness, between the caused and the causes. The
   caused indeed possess the accepted likenesses of the causes, but the
   causes themselves are elevated and established above the caused,
   according to the ratio of their proper origin. And, to use
   illustrations suitable to ourselves, pleasures and pains are said to be
   productive of pleasure and pain, but these themselves feel neither
   pleasure nor pain. And fire, whilst heating and burning, is not said to
   be burnt and heated. And, if any one should say that the self-existent
   Life lives, or that the self-existent Light is enlightened, in my view
   he will not speak correctly, unless, perhaps, he should say this after
   another fashion, that the properties of the caused are abundantly and
   essentially pre-existent in the causes.

   SECTION IX.

   Further also, the most conspicuous fact of all theology--the
   God-formation of Jesus amongst us--is both unutterable by every
   expression and unknown to every mind, even to the very foremost of the
   most reverend angels. The fact indeed that. He took substance as man,
   we have received as a mystery, but we do not know in what manner, from
   virginal bloods, by a different law, beyond nature, He was formed, and
   how, with dry feet, having a bodily bulk and weight of matter, He
   marched upon the liquid and unstable substance [28] ; and so, with
   regard to all the other features of the super-physical physiology of
   Jesus. Now, we have elsewhere sufficiently spoken of these things, and
   they have been celebrated by our illustrious leader, in his Theological
   Elements, in a manner far beyond natural ability--things which that
   illustrious man acquired, either from the sacred theologians, or
   comprehended from the scientific, search of the Oracles, from manifold
   struggles and investigations respecting the same, or was instructed
   from a sort of more Divine Inspiration, not only having learnt, but
   having felt the pangs of things Divine, and from his sympathy with
   them, if I may so speak, having been perfected to their untaught and
   mystic union and acceptance. And that we may display, in fewest words,
   the many and blessed visions of his most excellent intelligence, the
   following are the things he says, concerning the Lord Jesus, in the
   Theological Elements compiled by him.

   SECTION X.

   From the Theological Elements of the most holy Hierotheus.

   Deity of the Lord Jesus,-- the Cause and Completing of all, which
   preserves the parts concordant with the whole, and is neither part nor
   whole, and whole and part, as embracing in Itself everything both part
   and whole, and being above and before--is perfect indeed in the
   imperfect, as source of perfection, but imperfect in the perfect, as
   super-perfect, and pre-perfect--Form producing form, in things without
   form, as Source of form--formless in the forms, as above
   form,--Essence, penetrating without stain the essences throughout, and
   superessential, exalted above every essence--setting bounds to the
   whole principalities and orders, and established above every
   principality and order. It is measure also of things existing, and age,
   and above age, and before age--full, in things that need, super-full in
   things full, unutterable, unspeakable, above mind, above life, above
   essence. It has the supernatural, supernaturally,--the superessential,
   superessentially. Hence, since through love towards man, He has come
   even to nature, and really became substantial, and the Super-God lived
   as Man [29] (may He be merciful with regard to the things we are
   celebrating, which are beyond mind and expression), and in these He has
   the supernatural and super-substantial, not only in so far as He
   communicated with us without alteration and without confusion,
   suffering no loss as regards His super-fulness, from His unutterable
   emptying of Himself--but also, because the newest of all new things, He
   was in our physical condition super-physical--in things substantial,
   super-substantial, excelling all the things--of us--from us--above us.

   SECTION XI.

   This then is sufficient on these matters, let us now advance to the
   purpose of the discourse by unfolding, to the best of our ability, the
   kindred and common Names of the Divine distinction. And, in order that
   we may first distinctly define everything, in order, we call Divine
   distinction, as we have said, the goodly progressions of the Godhead.
   For, by being given to all things existing, and pouring forth the whole
   imparted goods in abundance, It is distinguished uniformly, and
   multiplied uniquely, and is moulded into many from the One, whilst
   being self-centred. For example, since Almighty God is superessentially
   Being, but the Being is bequeathed to things being, and produces the
   whole Essences; that One Being is said to be fashioned in many forms,
   by the production from Itself of the many beings, whilst It remains
   undiminished, and One in the multiplicity, and Unified during the
   progression, and complete in the distinction, both by being
   superessentially exalted above all beings, and by the unique production
   of the whole; and by the un-lessened stream of His undiminished
   distributions. Further, being One, and having distributed the One, both
   to every part and whole, both to one and to multitude, He is One, as it
   were, superessentially, being neither a part of the multitude, nor
   whole from parts; and thus is neither one, nor partakes of one, nor has
   the one. But, beyond these, He is One, above the one, to things
   existing--One, and multitude indivisible, unfilled super-fulness,
   producing and perfecting and sustaining every one thing and multitude.
   Again, by the Deification from Itself, by the Divine likeness of many
   who become gods, according to their several capacity, there seems, and
   is said to be, a distinction and multiplication of the One God, but. He
   is none the less the Supreme God, and super-God, superessentially One
   God,--undivided in things divided, unified in Himself, both unmingled
   and unmultiplied in the many. And when the common conductor of
   ourselves, and of our leader to the Divine gift of light,--he, who is
   great in Divine mysteries--the light of the world--had thought out this
   in a manner above natural ability,--he speaks as follows, from the
   inspiration of God, in his sacred writings--"For, even if there are who
   are called gods, whether in heaven or upon earth, as there are gods
   many and lords many; but to us there is One God, the Father, from Whom
   are all things, and we unto Him,--and One Lord Jesus Christ, through
   Whom are all things, and we, through Him [30] ." For, with regard to
   things Divine, the unions overrule the distinctions, and precede them,
   and are none the less unified, even after the self-centred and unified
   distinction. These, the mutual and common distinctions, or rather the
   goodly progressions of the whole Deity, we will endeavour to the best
   of our ability to celebrate from the Names of God, which make them
   known in the Oracles;--first, having laid down, as we have said, that
   every beneficent Name of God, to whichever of the supremely Divine
   Persons it may be applied, is to be understood with reference to the
   whole Supremely Divine wholeness unreservedly.

   What is the power of prayer, and concerning the blessed Hierotheus, and
   concerning reverence and covenant in the Word of God.

   SECTION I.

   FIRST, with your permission, let us examine the all-perfect Name of
   Goodness, which is indicative of the whole progressions of Almighty
   God, having invoked the supremely good, and super-good Triad--the Name
   which indicates Its whole best Providences. For, we must first be
   raised up to It, as Source of good, by our prayers; and by a nearer
   approach to It, be initiated as to the all good gifts which are
   established around It. For It is indeed present to all, but all are not
   present to It. But then, when we have invoked It, by all pure prayers
   and unpolluted mind, and by our aptitude towards Divine Union, we also
   are present to It. For, It is not in a place, so that It should be
   absent from a particular place, or should pass from one to another. But
   even the statement that It is in all existing beings, falls short of
   Its infinitude (which is) above all, and embracing all. Let us then
   elevate our very selves by our prayers to the higher ascent of the
   Divine and good rays,--as if a luminous chain being suspended from the
   celestial heights, and reaching down hither, we, by ever clutching this
   upwards, first with one hand, and then with the other, seem indeed to
   draw it down, but in reality we do not draw it down, it being both
   above and below, but ourselves are carried upwards to the higher
   splendours of the luminous rays. Or, as if, after we have embarked on a
   ship, and are holding on to the cables reaching from some rock, such as
   are given out, as it were, for us to seize, we do not draw the rock to
   us, but ourselves, in fact, and the ship, to the rock. Or to take
   another example, if any one standing on the ship pushes away the rock
   by the sea shore, he will do nothing to the stationary and unmoved
   rock, but he separates himself from it, and in proportion as he pushes
   that away, he is so far hurled from it. Wherefore, before everything,
   and especially theology, we must begin with prayer, not as though we
   ourselves were drawing the power, which is everywhere and nowhere
   present, but as, by our godly reminiscences and invocations, conducting
   ourselves to, and making ourselves one with, it.

   SECTION II.

   Perhaps also, this is worthy of apology, that whilst our illustrious
   leader, Hierotheus, is compiling his Theological Elements, in a manner
   above natural capacity, we, as if those were not sufficient, have
   composed others, and this present theological treatise. And yet, if
   that man had deigned to treat systematically all the theological
   treatises, and had gone through the sum of all theology, by detailed
   expositions, we should not have gone to such a height of folly, or
   stupidity, as to have attempted alone theological questions, either
   more lucidly or divinely than he, or to indulge in vain talk by saying
   superfluously the same things twice over, and in addition to do
   injustice to one, both teacher and friend, and that we, who have been
   instructed from his discourses, after Paul the Divine, should filch for
   our own glorification his most illustrious contemplation and
   elucidation. But, since in fact, he, whilst teaching things divine, in
   a manner suitable to presbyters, set forth comprehensive definitions,
   and such as embraced many things in one, as were suitable to us, and to
   as many as with us were teachers of the newly-initiated souls,
   commanding us to unfold and disentangle, by language commensurate with
   our ability, the comprehensive and uniform compositions of the most
   intellectual capacity of that illustrious man; and you, yourself, have
   oftentimes urged us to this, and sent back the very book, as being of
   transcendent value; for this reason, then, we too distinguish him as a
   teacher of perfect and presbyterial conceptions for those who are above
   the common people, even as certain second Oracles, and next to the
   Anointed of God. But for people, such as we are, we will transmit
   things Divine, according to our capacity. For, if strong meat belongs
   to the perfect, how great perfection is required that the same should
   feed others. Correctly, then, we have affirmed this, that the
   self-perceptive vision of the intelligible Oracles, and their
   comprehensive teaching, needs presbyterial power; but the science and
   the thorough teaching of the reasons which lead to this, fittingly
   belong to those purified and hallowed persons placed in a subordinate
   position. And yet, we have insisted upon this with the utmost care,
   that, as regards the things that have been thoroughly investigated by
   him, our divine leader, with an accurate elucidation, we should not, in
   any way, handle the same tautologically, for the same elucidation of
   the Divine text expounded by him. For, amongst our inspired hierarchs
   (when both we, as you know, and yourself, and many of our holy
   brethren, were gathered together to the depositing of the
   Life-springing and God-receptive body, and when there were present also
   James, the brother of God, and Peter, the foremost and most honoured
   pinnacle of the Theologians, when it was determined after the
   depositing, that every one of the hierarchs should celebrate, as each
   was capable, the Omnipotent Goodness of the supremely Divine Weakness),
   he, after the Theologians, surpassed, as you know, all the other divine
   instructors, being wholly entranced, wholly raised from himself, and
   experiencing the pain of his fellowship with the things celebrated, and
   was regarded as an inspired and divine Psalmist by all, by whom he was
   heard and seen and known, and not known. And why should I say anything
   to thee concerning the things there divinely spoken? For, if I do not
   forget myself, many a time do I remember to have heard from thee
   certain portions of those inspired songs of praise; such was thy zeal,
   not cursorily, to pursue things Divine.

   SECTION III.

   But to pass over the mystical things there, both as forbidden to the
   multitude and as known to thee, when it was necessary to communicate to
   the multitude, and to bring as many as possible to the sacred knowledge
   amongst ourselves, he so excelled the majority of sacred teachers, both
   by use of time and purity of mind, and accuracy of demonstrations, and
   by his other sacred discourses, that we should scarcely have dared to
   look so great a sun straight in the face. For we are thus far conscious
   in ourselves, and know, that we may neither advance to understand
   sufficiently the intelligible of Divine things, nor to express and
   declare the things spoken of the divine knowledge. For, being far
   removed from the skill of those divine men, as regards theological
   truth, we are so inferior that we should have, through excessive
   reverence, entirely come to this--neither to hear nor to speak anything
   respecting divine philosophy, unless we had grasped in our mind, that
   we must not neglect the knowledge of things divine received by us. And
   to this we were persuaded, not only by the innate aspirations of the
   minds which always lovingly cling to the permitted contemplation of the
   supernatural, but also by the most excellent order itself of the Divine
   institutions, which prohibits us, on the one hand, from much
   inquisition into things above us, as above our degree, and as
   unattainable; yet, on the other hand, persistently urges us to
   graciously impart to others also whatever is permitted and given to us
   to learn. Yielding then to these considerations, and neither shirking
   nor flinching from the attainable discovery of things Divine, but also
   not bearing to leave unassisted those who are unable to contemplate
   things too high for us, we have brought ourselves to composition, not
   daring indeed to introduce anything new, but by more easy and more
   detailed expositions to disentangle and elucidate the things spoken by
   the Hierotheus indeed.

  CAPUT IV.

   Concerning Good, Light, Beauty, Love, Ecstasy, Jealousy, and that the
   Evil is neither existent, nor from existent, nor in things being.

   SECTION I.

   BE it so then. Let us come to the appellation "Good," already mentioned
   in our discourse, which the Theologians ascribe pre-eminently and
   exclusively to the super-Divine Deity, as I conjecture, by calling the
   supremely Divine Subsistence, Goodness; and because the Good, as
   essential Good, by Its being, extends Its Goodness to all things that
   be.

   For, even as our sun--not as calculating or choosing, but by its very
   being, enlightens all things able to partake of its light in their own
   degree--so too the Good--as superior to a sun, as the archetype par
   excellence, is above an obscure image--by Its very existence sends to
   all things that be, the rays of Its whole goodness, according to their
   capacity. By reason of these (rays) subsisted all the intelligible and
   intelligent essences and powers and energies. By reason of these they
   are, and have their life, continuous and undiminished, purified from
   all corruption and death and matter, and generation; and separated from
   the unstable and fluctuating and vacillating mutability, and are
   conceived of as incorporeal and immaterial, and as minds they think in
   a manner supermundane, and are illuminated as to the reasons of things,
   in a manner peculiar to themselves; and they again convey to their
   kindred spirits things appropriate to them; and they have their abiding
   from Goodness; and thence comes to them stability and consistence and
   protection, and sanctuary of good things; and whilst aspiring to It,
   they have both being and good being; and being conformed to It, as is
   attainable, they are both patterns of good, and impart to those after
   them, as the Divine Law directs, the gifts which have passed through to
   themselves from the Good.

   SECTION II.

   Thence come to them the supermundane
   orders, the unions amongst themselves, the mutual penetrations, the
   unconfused distinctions, the powers elevating the inferior to the
   superior, the providences of the more exalted for those below them; the
   guardings of things pertaining to each power; and unbroken convolutions
   around themselves; the identities and sublimities around the aspiration
   after the Good; and whatever is said in our Treatise concerning the
   angelic properties and orders. Further also, whatever things belong to
   the heavenly Hierarchy, the purifications befitting angels, the
   supermundane illuminations, and the things perfecting the whole angelic
   perfection, are from the all-creative and fontal Goodness; from which
   was given to them the form of Goodness, and the revealing in themselves
   the hidden Goodness, and that angels are, as it were, heralds of the
   Divine silence, and project, as it were, luminous lights revealing Him
   Who is in secret. Further, after these--the sacred and holy minds--the
   souls, and whatever is good in souls is by reason of the super-good
   Goodness--the fact that they are intellectual--that they have essential
   life--indestructible--the very being itself--and that they are able,
   whilst elevated themselves to the angelic lives, to be conducted by
   them as good guides to the good Origin of all good things, and to
   become partakers of the illuminations, thence bubbling forth, according
   to the capacity of each, and to participate in the goodlike gift, as
   they are able, and whatever else we have enumerated in our Treatise
   concerning the soul. But also, if one may be permitted to speak of the
   irrational souls, or living creatures, such as cleave the air, and such
   as walk on earth, and such as creep along earth, and those whose life
   is in waters, or amphibious, and such as live concealed under earth,
   and burrow within it, and in one word, such as have the sensible soul
   or life, even all these have their soul and life, by reason of the
   Good. Moreover, all plants have their growing and moving life from the
   Good; and even soulless and lifeless substance is by reason of the
   Good, and by reason of It, has inherited its substantial condition.

   SECTION III.

   But, if the Good is above all things being, as indeed it is, and
   formulates the formless, even in Itself alone, both the non-essential
   is a pre-eminence of essence, and the non-living is a superior life,
   and the mindless a superior wisdom, and whatever is in the Good is of a
   superlative formation of the formless, and if one may venture to say
   so, even the nonexistent itself aspires to the Good above all things
   existing, and struggles somehow to be even itself in the Good,--the
   really Superessential--to the exclusion of all things.

   SECTION IV.

   But what slipped from our view in the midst of our discourse, the Good
   is Cause of the celestial movements in their commencements and
   terminations, of their not increasing, not diminishing, and completely
   changeless, course [31] , and of the noiseless movements, if one may so
   speak, of the vast celestial transit, and of the astral orders, and the
   beauties and lights, and stabilities, and the progressive swift motion
   of certain stars, and of the periodical return of the two luminaries,
   which the Oracles call "great," from the same to the same quarter,
   after which our days and nights being marked, and months and years
   being measured, mark and number and arrange and comprehend the circular
   movements of time and things temporal. But, what would any one say of
   the very ray of the sun? For the light is from the Good, and an image
   of the Goodness, wherefore also the Good is celebrated under the name
   of Light; as in a portrait the original is manifested. For, as the
   goodness of the Deity, beyond all, permeates from the highest and most
   honoured substances even to the lowest, and yet is above all, neither
   the foremost outstripping its superiority, nor the things below eluding
   its grasp, but it both enlightens all that are capable, and forms and
   enlivens, and grasps, and perfects, and is measure of things existing,
   and age, and number, and order, and grasp, and cause, and end; so, too,
   the brilliant likeness of the Divine Goodness, this our great sun,
   wholly bright and ever luminous, as a most distant echo of the Good,
   both enlightens whatever is capable of participating in it, and
   possesses the light in the highest degree of purity, unfolding to the
   visible universe, above and beneath, the splendours of its own rays,
   and if anything does not participate in them, this is not owing to the
   inertness or deficiency of its distribution of light, but is owing to
   the inaptitude for light-reception of the things which do not unfold
   themselves for the participation of light. No doubt the ray passing
   over many things in such condition, enlightens the things after them,
   and there is no visible thing which it does not reach, with the
   surpassing greatness of its own splendour. Further also, it contributes
   to the generation of sensible bodies, and moves them to life, and
   nourishes, and increases, and perfects, and purifies and renews; and
   the light is both measure and number of hours, days, and all our time.
   For it is the light itself, even though it was then without form, which
   the divine Moses declared to have fixed that first Triad [32] of our
   days. And, just as Goodness turns all things to Itself, and is chief
   collector of things scattered, as One-springing and One-making Deity,
   and all things aspire to It, as Source and Bond and End, and it is the
   Good, as the Oracles say, from Which all things subsisted, and are
   being brought into being by an all-perfect Cause; and in Which all
   things consisted, as guarded and governed in an all-controlling route;
   and to Which all things are turned, as to their own proper end; and to
   Which all aspire --the intellectual and rational indeed, through
   knowledge, and the sensible through the senses, and those bereft of
   sensible perception by the innate movement of the aspiration after
   life, and those without life, and merely being, by their aptitude for
   mere substantial participation; after the same method of its
   illustrious original, the light also collects and turns to itself all
   things existing--things with sight --things with motion--things
   enlightened--things heated--things wholly held together by its
   brilliant splendours--whence also, Helios, because it makes all things
   altogether (aolle), and collects things scattered. And all creatures,
   endowed with sensible perceptions, aspire to it, as aspiring either to
   see, or to be moved and enlightened, and heated, and to be wholly held
   together by the light. By no means do I affirm, after the statement of
   antiquity, that as being God and Creator of the universe, the sun, by
   itself, governs the luminous world, but that the invisible things of
   God are clearly seen from the foundation of the world, being understood
   by the things that are made, even His eternal power and Deity.

   SECTION V.

   But we have spoken of these things in our Symbolical Theology. Let us
   now then celebrate the spiritual Name of Light, under Which we
   contemplate the Good, and declare that He, the Good, is called
   spiritual [33] Light, on the ground that He fills every supercelestial
   mind with spiritual light, and expels all ignorance and error from all
   souls in which they may be, and imparts to them all sacred light, and
   cleanses their mental vision from the mist which envelops them, from
   ignorance, and stirs up and unfolds those enclosed by the great weight
   of darkness, and imparts, at first, a measured radiance; then, whilst
   they taste, as it were, the light, and desire it more, more fully gives
   Itself, and more abundantly enlightens them, because "they have loved
   much," and ever elevates them to things in advance, as befits the
   analogy of each for aspiration.

   SECTION VI.

   The Good then above every light is called spiritual Light, as fontal
   ray, and stream of light welling over, shining upon every mind, above,
   around [34] , and in the world, from its fulness, and renewing their
   whole mental powers, and embracing them all by its over-shadowing; and
   being above all by its exaltation; and in one word, by embracing and
   having previously and pre-eminently the whole sovereignty of the
   light-dispensing faculty, as being source of light and above all light,
   and by comprehending in itself all things intellectual, and all things
   rational, and making them one altogether. For as ignorance puts asunder
   those who have gone astray, so the presence of the spiritual light is
   collective and unifying of those being enlightened, both perfecting and
   further turning them towards the true Being, by turning them from the
   many notions and collecting the various views, or, to speak more
   correctly, fancies, into one true, pure and uniform knowledge, and by
   filling them with light, one and unifying.

   SECTION VII.

   This Good is celebrated by the sacred theologians, both as beautiful
   and as Beauty, and as Love, and as Beloved; and all the other Divine
   Names which beseem the beautifying and highly-favoured comeliness. But
   the beautiful and Beauty are not to be divided, as regards the Cause
   which has embraced the whole in one. For, with regard to all created
   things, by dividing them into participations and participants, we call
   beautiful that which participates in Beauty; but beauty, the
   participation of the beautifying Cause of all the beautiful things.
   But, the superessential Beautiful is called Beauty, on account of the
   beauty communicated from Itself to all beautiful things, in a manner
   appropriate to each, and as Cause of the good harmony and brightness of
   all things which flashes like light to all the beautifying
   distributions of its fontal ray, and as calling (kaloun) all things to
   Itself (whence also it is called Beauty) (kallos), and as collecting
   all in all to Itself. (And it is called) Beautiful, as (being) at once
   beautiful and super-beautiful, and always being under the same
   conditions and in the same manner beautiful, and neither coming into
   being nor perishing, neither waxing nor waning; neither in this
   beautiful, nor in that ugly, nor at one time beautiful, and at another
   not; nor in relation to one thing beautiful, and in relation to another
   ugly, nor here, and not there, as being beautiful to some, and not
   beautiful to others; but as Itself, in Itself, with Itself, uniform,
   always being beautiful, and as having beforehand in Itself
   pre-eminently the fontal beauty of everything beautiful. For, by the
   simplex and supernatural nature of all beautiful things, all beauty,
   and everything beautiful, pre-existed uniquely as to Cause. From this
   Beautiful (comes) being to all existing things,--that each is beautiful
   in its own proper order; and by reason of the Beautiful are the
   adaptations of all things, and friendships, and inter-communions, and
   by the Beautiful all things are made one, and the Beautiful is origin
   of all things, as a creating Cause, both by moving the whole and
   holding it together by the love of its own peculiar Beauty; and end of
   all things, and beloved, as final Cause (for all things exist for the
   sake of the Beautiful) and exemplary (Cause), because all things are
   determined according to It. Wherefore, also, the Beautiful is identical
   with the Good, because all things aspire to the Beautiful and Good, on
   every account, and there is no existing thing which does not
   participate in the Beautiful and the Good. Yea, reason will dare to say
   even this, that even the non-existing participates in the Beautiful and
   Good. For then even it is beautiful and good, when in God it is
   celebrated superessentially to the exclusion of all. This, the one Good
   and Beautiful, is uniquely Cause of all the many things beautiful and
   good. From this are all the substantial beginnings of things existing,
   the unions, the distinctions, the identities, the diversities, the
   similarities, the dissimilarities, the communions of the contraries,
   the commingling of things unified, the providences of the superior, the
   mutual cohesions of those of the same rank; the attentions of the more
   needy, the protecting and immoveable abidings and stabilities of their
   whole selves and, on the other hand, the communions of all things among
   all, in a manner peculiar to each, and adaptations and unmingled
   friendships and harmonies of the whole, the blendings in the whole, and
   the undissolved connections of existing things, the never-failing
   successions of the generations, all rests and movements, of the minds,
   of the souls, of the bodies. For, that which is established above every
   rest, and every movement, and moves each thing in the law of its own
   being to its proper movement, is a rest and movement to all.

   SECTION VIII.

   Now, the divine minds [35] are said to be moved circularly indeed, by
   being united to the illuminations of the Beautiful and Good, without
   beginning and without end; but in a direct line, whenever they advance
   to the succour of a subordinate, by accomplishing all things directly;
   but spirally, because even in providing for the more indigent, they
   remain fixedly, in identity, around the good and beautiful Cause of
   their identity, ceaselessly dancing around.

   SECTION IX.

   Further, there is a movement of soul, circular indeed,--the entrance
   into itself from things without, and the unified convolution of its
   intellectual powers, bequeathing to it inerrancy, as it were, in a sort
   of circle, and turning and collecting itself, from the many things
   without, first to itself, then, as having become single, uniting with
   the uniquely unified powers, and thus conducting to the Beautiful and
   Good, which is above all things being, and One and the Same, and
   without beginning and without end. But a soul is moved spirally, in so
   far as it is illuminated, as to the divine kinds of knowledge, in a
   manner proper to itself, not intuitively and at once, but logically and
   discursively; and, as it were, by mingled and relative operations; but
   in a straight line, when, not entering into itself, and being moved by
   unique intuition (for this, as I said, is the circular), but advancing
   to things around itself, and from things without, it is, as it were,
   conducted from certain symbols, varied and multiplied, to the simple
   and unified contemplations.

   SECTION X.

   Of these three motions then in everything perceptible here below, and
   much more of the abidings and repose and fixity of each, the Beautiful
   and Good, which is above all repose and movement, is Cause and Bond and
   End; by reason of which, and from which, and in which, and towards
   which, and for sake of which, is every repose and movement. For, both
   from It and through It is both Essence and every life, and both of mind
   and soul and every nature, the minutiae, the equalities, the
   magnitudes, all the standards and the analogies of beings, and
   harmonies and compositions; the entireties, the parts, every one thing,
   and multitude, the connections of parts, the unions of every multitude,
   the perfections of the entireties, the quality, the weight, the size,
   the infinitude, the compounds, the distinctions, every infinitude,
   every term, all the bounds, the orders, the pre-eminences, the
   elements, the forms, every essence, every power, every energy, every
   condition, every sensible perception, every reason, every conception,
   every contact, every science, every union, and in one word, all things
   existing are from the Beautiful and Good, and in the Beautiful and
   Good, and turn themselves to the Beautiful and Good.

   Moreover, all things whatever, which are and come to being, are and
   come to being by reason of the Beautiful and Good; and to It all things
   look, and by It are moved and held together, and for the sake of It,
   and by reason of It, and in It, is every source exemplary, final,
   creative, formative, elemental, and in one word, every beginning, every
   bond, every term, or to speak summarily, all things existing are from
   the Beautiful and Good; and all things non-existing are
   superessentially in the Beautiful and Good; and it is of all, beginning
   and term, above beginning and above term, because from It, and through
   It, and in It, and to It, are all things, as says the Sacred Word.

   By all things, then, the Beautiful and Good is desired and beloved and
   cherished; and, by reason of It, and for the sake of It, the less love
   the greater suppliantly; and those of the same rank, their fellows
   brotherly; and the greater, the less considerately; and these severally
   love the things of themselves continuously; and all things by aspiring
   to the Beautiful and Good, do and wish all things whatever they do and
   wish. Further, it may be boldly said with truth, that even the very
   Author of all things, by reason of overflowing Goodness, loves all,
   makes all, perfects all, sustains all, attracts all; and even the
   Divine Love is Good of Good, by reason of the Good. For Love itself,
   the benefactor of things that be, pre-existing overflowingly in the
   Good, did not permit itself to remain unproductive in itself, but moved
   itself to creation [36] , as befits the overflow which is generative of
   all.

   SECTION XI.

   And let no one fancy that we honour the Name of Love beyond the
   Oracles, for it is, in my opinion, irrational and stupid not to cling
   to the force of the meaning, but to the mere words; and this is not the
   characteristic of those who have wished to comprehend things Divine,
   but of those who receive empty sounds and keep the same just at the
   ears from passing through from outside, and are not willing to know
   what such a word signifies, and in what way one ought to distinctly
   represent it, through other words of the same force and more
   explanatory, but who specially affect sounds and signs without meaning,
   and syllables, and words unknown, which do not pass through to the
   mental part of their soul, but buzz without, around their lips and
   ears, as though it were not permitted to signify the number four, by
   twice two, or straight lines by direct lines, or motherland by
   fatherland, or any other, which signify the self-same thing, by many
   parts of speech.

   We ought to know, according to the correct account, that we use sounds,
   and syllables, and phrases, and descriptions, and words, on account of
   the sensible perceptions; since when our soul is moved by the
   intellectual energies to the things contemplated, the sensible
   perceptions by aid of sensible objects are superfluous; just as also
   the intellectual powers, when the soul, having become godlike, throws
   itself, through a union beyond knowledge, against the rays of the
   unapproachable light, by sightless efforts. But, when the mind strives
   to be moved upwards, through objects of sense, to contemplative
   conceptions, the clearer interpretations are altogether preferable to
   the sensible perceptions, and the more definite descriptions are things
   more distinct than things seen; since when objects near are not made
   clear to the sensible perceptions, neither will these perceptions be
   well able to present the things perceived to the mind. But that we may
   not seem, in speaking thus, to be pushing aside the Divine Oracles, let
   those who libel the Name of Love (Erotos) hear them. "Be in love with
   It," they say, "and It will keep thee--Rejoice over It, and It will
   exalt thee--Honour It, in order that It may encompass thee,"--and
   whatever else is sung respecting Love, in the Word of God.

   SECTION XII.

   And yet it seemed to some of our sacred expounders that the Name of
   Love is more Divine than that of loving-kindness (agapes). But even the
   Divine Ignatius [37] writes, "my own Love (eros) is crucified;" and in
   the introductions to the Oracles you will find a certain One saying of
   the Divine Wisdom, "1 became enamoured of her Beauty." So that we,
   certainly, need not be afraid of this Name of Love, nor let any
   alarming statement about it terrify us. For the theologians seem to me
   to treat as equivalent the name of Loving-kindness, and that of Love;
   and on this ground, to attribute, by preference, the veritable Love, to
   things Divine, because of the misplaced prejudice of such men as these.
   For, since the veritable Love is sung of in a sense befitting God, not
   by us only, but also by the Oracles themselves, the multitude, not
   having comprehended the Oneness of the Divine Name of Love, fell away,
   as might be expected of them, to the divided and corporeal and
   sundered, seeing it is not a real love, but a shadow, or rather a
   falling from the veritable Love. For the Oneness of the Divine and one
   Love is incomprehensible to the multitude, wherefore also, as seeming a
   very hard name to the multitude, it is assigned to the Divine Wisdom,
   for the purpose of leading back and restoring them to the knowledge of
   the veritable Love; and for their liberation from the difficulty
   respecting it. And again, as regards ourselves, where it happened often
   that men of an earthly character imagined something out of place,
   (there is used) what appears more euphonius. A certain one says, "Thy
   affection fell upon me, as the affection of the women." For those who
   have rightly listened to things Divine, the name of Loving-kindness and
   of Love is placed by the holy theologians in the same category
   throughout the Divine revelations, and this is of a power unifying, and
   binding together, and mingling pre-eminently in the Beautiful and Good;
   pre-existing by reason of the beautiful and good, and imparted from the
   beautiful and good, by reason of the Beautiful and Good; and sustaining
   things of the same rank, within their mutual coherence, but moving the
   first to forethought for the inferior, and attaching the inferior to
   the superior by respect.

   SECTION XIII.

   But Divine Love is extatic, not permitting (any) to be lovers of
   themselves, but of those beloved. They shew this too, the superior by
   becoming mindful of the inferior; and the equals by their mutual
   coherence; and the inferior, by a more divine respect towards things
   superior. Wherefore also, Paul the Great, when possessed by the Divine
   Love, and participating in its extatic power, says with inspired lips,
   "I live no longer, but Christ lives in me." As a true lover, and beside
   himself, as he says, to Almighty God, and not living the life of
   himself, but the life of the Beloved, as a life excessively esteemed.
   One might make bold to say even this, on behalf of truth, that the very
   Author of all things, by the beautiful and good love of everything,
   through an overflow of His loving goodness, becomes out of Himself, by
   His providences for all existing things, and is, as it were, cozened by
   goodness and affection and love, and is led down from the Eminence
   above all, and surpassing all, to being in all, as befits an extatic
   superessential power centred in Himself. Wherefore, those skilled in
   Divine things call Him even Jealous, as (being) that vast good Love
   towards all beings, and as rousing His loving inclination to
   jealousy,--and as proclaiming Himself Jealous--to Whom the things
   desired are objects of jealousy, and as though the objects of His
   providential care were objects of jealousy for Him. And, in short, the
   lovable is of the Beautiful and Good, and Love preexisted both in the
   Beautiful and Good, and on account of the Beautiful and Good, is and
   takes Being.

   SECTION XIV.

   But what do the theologians mean when at one time they call Him Love,
   and Loving-kindness, and at another, Loved and Esteemed? For, of the
   one, He is Author and, as it were, Producer and Father; but the other,
   He Himself is; and by one He is moved, but by the other He moves; or
   (when they say), that He Himself is Procurer and Mover of Himself and
   by Himself. In this sense, they call Him esteemed and loved, as
   Beautiful and Good: but again Love and Loving-kindness, as being at
   once moving and conducting Power to Himself;--the alone--self Beautiful
   and Good, by reason of Itself, and, being, as it were, a manifestation
   of Itself through Itself, and a good Progression of the surpassing
   union, and a loving Movement, simplex, self-moved, self-operating,
   pre-existing in the Good, and from the Good bubbling forth to things
   existing, and again returning to the Good, in which also the Divine
   Love indicates distinctly Its own unending and unbeginning, as it were
   a sort of everlasting circle whirling round in unerring combination, by
   reason of the Good, from the Good, and in the Good, and to the Good,
   and ever advancing and remaining and returning in the same and
   throughout the same. And these things our illustrious initiator
   divinely set forth throughout His Hymns of Love, of which we may
   appropriately make mention, and, as it were, place as a certain sacred
   chapter to our treatise concerning Love.

   SECTION XV.

   Extract from the "Hymns of Love" by the most holy Hierotheus:--

   Love, whether we speak of Divine, or Angelic, or intelligent, or
   psychical, or physical, let us regard as a certain unifying and
   combining power, moving the superior to forethought for the inferior,
   and the equals to a mutual fellowship, and lastly, the inferior to
   respect towards the higher and superior.

   SECTION XVI.

   Of the same, from the same Erotic Hymns.

   Since we have arranged the many loves from the one, by telling, in due
   order, what are the kinds of knowledge and powers of the mundane and
   supermundane loves; over which, according to the defined purpose of the
   discourse, the orders and ranks of the mental and intelligible loves
   preside; next after [38] which are placed the self-existent
   intelligible and divine, over the really beautiful loves there which
   have been appropriately celebrated by us; now, on the other hand, by
   restoring all back to the One and enfolded Love, and Father of them
   all, let us collect and gather them together from the many, by
   contracting It into two Powers entirely lovable, over which rules and
   precedes altogether the Cause, resistless from Its universal Love
   beyond all, and to which is elevated, according to the nature of each
   severally, the whole love from all existing things.

   SECTION XVII.

   Of the same, from the same Hymns of Love.

   Come then, whilst collecting these again into one, let us say, that it
   is a certain simplex power, which of itself moves to a sort of unifying
   combination from the Good, to the lowest of things existing, and from
   that again in due order, circling round again, through all to the Good
   from Itself, and through Itself and by Itself, and rolling back to
   Itself always in the same way.

   SECTION XVIII.

   And yet, any one might say, "if the Beautiful and Good is beloved and
   desired, and esteemed by all (for even that which is non-existing
   desires It, as we have said, and struggles how to be in It; and Itself
   is the form-giving, even of things without form, and by It alone, even
   the non-existing is said to be, and is superessentially)--"How is it
   that the host of demons do not desire the Beautiful and Good, but,
   through their earthly proclivities, having fallen away from the angelic
   identity, as regards the desire of the Good, have become cause of all
   evils both to themselves and to all the others who are said to be
   corrupted? and why, in short, when the tribes of demons have been
   brought into being from the Good, are they not like the Good? or how,
   after being a good production from the Good, were they changed? and
   what is that which depraved them, and in short, what is evil? and from
   what source did it spring? and in which of things existing is it? and
   how did He, Who is Good, will to bring it into being? and how, when He
   willed it, was He able? And if evil is from another cause, what other
   cause is there for things existing, beside the Good? Further, how, when
   there is a Providence, is there evil, either coming into existence at
   all, or not destroyed? And how does any existing thing desire it, in
   comparison with the Good?

   SECTION XIX. [39]

   Such a statement as this might be alleged by way of objection. We,
   however, on our part, will pray the objector to look to the truth of
   the facts, and will make bold to say this first. The Evil is not from
   the Good, and if it is from the Good, it is not the Evil. For, it is
   not the nature of fire to make cold, nor of good to bring into being
   things not good; and if all things that be are from the Good (for to
   produce and to preserve is natural to the Good, but to destroy and to
   dissolve, to the Evil), there is no existing thing from the Evil, nor
   will the Evil itself be, if it should be evil even to itself. And, if
   it be not so, the Evil is not altogether evil, but has some portion of
   the Good, in consequence of which it wholly is. Now, if the things
   existing desire the Beautiful and Good, and whatever they do, they do
   for the sake of that which seems good, and every purpose of things
   existing has the Good for its beginning and end (for nothing looking to
   the Evil qua evil, does what it does), how shall the Evil be in things
   existing; or, wholly being, how has it been seduced from such a good
   yearning? Also if all the things existing are from the Good, and the
   Good is above all things existing, then there is existing in the Good
   even the non-existing; but the Evil is not existing; and, if this be
   not the case, it is not altogether evil, nor non-existing, for the
   absolutely non-existing will be nothing, unless it should be spoken of
   as in the Good superessentially. The Good, then, will be fixed far
   above both the absolutely existing and the non-existing; but the Evil
   is neither in things existing, nor in things non-existing, but, being
   further distant from the Good than the non-existing itself, it is alien
   and more unsubstantial. Where then is the Evil? some one may perchance
   say. For if the Evil is not,--virtue and vice are the same, both
   universally and particularly. Or, not even that which opposes itself to
   virtue will be evil, and yet sobriety and license, and righteousness
   and unrighteousness, are contraries. And I, by no means, speak in
   reference to the just and unjust man, and the temperate and intemperate
   man; but also, long before the difference between the just man and his
   opposite is made manifest externally, in the very soul itself the vices
   stand altogether apart from the virtues, and the passions rebel against
   the reason; and from this we must grant some evil contrary to the Good.
   For the Good is not contrary to Itself, but as the product from one
   Source and one Cause, It rejoices in fellowship and unity and
   friendship. Nor yet is the lesser good opposed to the greater, for
   neither is the less heat or cold opposed to the greater. The Evil [40]
   then is in things existing, and is existing, and is opposed, and is in
   opposition to, the Good; and if it is the destruction of things
   existing, this does not expel the Evil from existence; but it will be,
   both itself existing, and generator of things existing. Does not
   frequently the destruction of one become birth of another? and the Evil
   will be contributing to the completion of the whole, and supplying
   through itself non-imperfection to the whole.

   SECTION XX.

   Now to all this true reason will answer, that the Evil qua evil makes
   no single essence or birth, but only, as far as it can, pollutes and
   destroys the subsistence of things existing. But, if any one says, that
   it is productive of being, and that by destruction of one it gives
   birth to another, we must truly answer, that not qua destruction it
   gives birth, but qua destruction and evil, it destroys and pollutes
   only, but it becomes birth and essence, by reason of the Good; and the
   Evil will be destruction indeed, by reason of itself; but producer of
   birth by reason of the Good; and qua evil, it is neither existing, nor
   productive of things existing; but, by reason of the Good, it is both
   existing and good-existing, and productive of things good. Yea, rather
   (for neither will the same by itself be both good and evil, nor the
   self-same power be of itself destruction and birth--neither as
   self-acting power, nor as self-acting destruction), the absolutely Evil
   is neither existing nor good, nor generative, nor productive of things
   being and good; but the Good in whatever things it may be perfectly
   engendered, makes them perfect and pure, and thoroughly good,--but the
   things which partake of it in a less degree are both imperfectly good,
   and impure, by reason of the lack of the Good. And (thus) the Evil
   altogether, is not, nor is good, nor good producing; but that which
   approaches more or less near the Good will be proportionately good;
   since the All-perfect Goodness, in passing through all, not only passes
   to the All-good beings around Itself, but extends Itself to the most
   remote, by being present to some thoroughly, to others subordinately,
   but to the rest, in the most remote degree, as each existing thing is
   able to participate in It. And some things, indeed, participate in the
   Good entirely, whilst others are deprived of It, in a more or less
   degree, but others possess a more obscure participation in the Good;
   and to the rest, the Good is present as a most distant echo. For if the
   Good were not present according to the capacity of each, the most
   Divine and honoured would occupy the rank of the lowest. And how were
   it possible that all should participate in the Good uniformly, when not
   all are in the same way adapted to its whole participation?

   Now, this is the exceeding greatness of the power of the Good, that It
   empowers, both things deprived, and the deprivation of Itself, with a
   view to the entire participation of itself. And, if one must make bold
   to speak the truth, even the things fighting against It, both are, and
   are able to fight, by Its power. Yea rather, in order that I may speak
   summarily, all things which are, in so far as they are, both are good,
   and from the Good; but, in so far as they are deprived of the Good, are
   neither good, nor do they exist. For, even with regard to the other
   conditions, such as heat or cold, there are things which have been
   heated, and when the heat has departed from them, many of them are
   deprived both of life and intelligence (now Almighty God is outside
   essence, and is, superessentially), and, in one word, with regard to
   the rest, even when the condition has departed, or has not become
   completely developed, things exist, and are able to subsist; but that
   which is every way deprived of the Good, in no way or manner ever was,
   or is, or will be, nor is able to be. For example, the licentious man,
   even if he have been deprived of the Good, as regards his irrational
   lust, in this respect he neither is, nor desires realities, but
   nevertheless he participates in the Good, in his very obscure echo of
   union and friendship. And, even Anger participates in the Good, by the
   very movement and desire to direct and turn the seeming evils to the
   seeming good. And the very man, who desires the very worst life, as
   wholly desirous of life and that which seems best to him, by the very
   fact of desiring, and desiring life, and looking to a best life,
   participates in the Good. And, if you should entirely take away the
   Good, there will be neither essence, nor life, nor yearning, nor
   movement, nor anything else. So that the fact, that birth is born from
   destruction, is not a power of evil, but a presence of a lesser good,
   even as disease is a defect of order, not total--for, if this should
   be, not even the disease itself will continue to exist, but the disease
   remains and is, by having the lowest possible order of essence, and in
   this continues to exist as a parasite. For that which is altogether
   deprived of the Good, is neither existing, nor in things existing; but
   the compound, by reason of the Good in things existing, and in
   consequence of this in things existing, is also existing in so far as
   it participates in the Good. Yea rather, all things existing will so
   far be, more or less, as they participate in the Good; for, even as
   respects the self-existing Being, that which in no ways is at all, will
   not be at all; but that which partially is, but partially is not, in so
   far as it has fallen from the ever Being, is not; but so far as it has
   participated in the Being, so far it is, and its whole being, and its
   non-being, is sustained and preserved. And the Evil,--that which has
   altogether fallen from the Good--will be good, neither in the more nor
   in the less; but the partially good, and partially not good, fight no
   doubt against a certain good, but not against the whole Good, and, even
   it is sustained by the participation of the Good, and the Good gives
   essence even to the privation of Itself, wholly by the participation of
   Itself; for, when the Good has entirely departed, there will be neither
   anything altogether good, nor compound, nor absolute evil. For, if the
   Evil is an imperfect good, (then) by the entire absence of the Good,
   both the imperfect and the perfect Good will be absent; and then only
   will be, and be seen, the Evil, when on the one hand, it is an evil to
   those things to which it was opposed, and, on the other, is expelled
   from other things on account of their goodness. For, it is impossible
   that the same things, under the same conditions in every respect,
   should fight against each other. The Evil then is not an actual thing.

   SECTION XXI.

   But neither is the Evil in things existing. For, if all things existing
   are from the Good, and the Good is in all things existing, and embraces
   all, either the Evil will not be in things existing, or it will be in
   the Good; and certainly it will not be in the Good, for neither is cold
   in fire, nor to do evil in Him, Who turns even the evil to good. But,
   if it shall be, how will the Evil be in the Good? If forsooth, from
   Itself, it is absurd and impossible. For it is not possible, as the
   infallibility of the Oracles affirms, that a "good tree should bring
   forth evil fruits," nor certainly, vice versa. But, if not from Itself,
   it is evident that it will be from another source and cause. For,
   either the Evil will be from the Good, or the Good from the Evil; or,
   if this be not possible, both the Good and the Evil will be from
   another source and cause, for no dual is source, but a Unit will be
   source of every dual. Further, it is absurd that two entirely
   contraries should proceed and be from one and the same, and that the
   self-same source should be, not simplex and unique, but divided and
   double, and contrary to itself, and be changed; and certainly it is not
   possible that there should be two contrary sources of things existing,
   and that these should be contending in each other, and in the whole.
   For, if this were granted, even Almighty God will not be in repose, nor
   free from disquietude, if there were indeed something bringing
   disturbance even to Him. Then, everything will be in disorder, and
   always fighting; and yet the Good distributes friendship to all
   existing things, and is celebrated by the holy theologians, both as
   very Peace, and Giver of Peace. Wherefore, things good are both
   friendly and harmonious, every one, and products of one life, and
   marshalled to one good; and kind, and similar, and affable to each
   other. So that the Evil is not in God, and the Evil is not inspired by
   God. But neither is the Evil from God, for, either He is not good, or
   He does good, and produces good things; and, not once in a way, and
   some; and at another time not, and not all; for this would argue
   transition and change, even as regards the very Divinest thing of all,
   the Cause. But, if in God, the Good is sustaining essence, God, when
   changing from the Good, will be sometimes Being, and sometimes not
   Being. But, if He has the Good by participation, He will then have it
   from another; and sometimes He will have it, and sometimes not. The
   Evil, then, is not from God, nor in God, neither absolutely nor
   occasionally.

   SECTION XXII.

   But neither is the Evil in Angels; for if the good-like angel proclaims
   the goodness of God, being by participation in a secondary degree that
   which the Announced is in the first degree as Cause, the Angel is a
   likeness of Almighty God--a manifestation of the unmanifested light--a
   mirror untarnished--most transparent--without flaw--pure--without
   spot-- receiving, if I may so speak, the full beauty of the
   Good-stamped likeness of God--and without stain, shedding forth
   undefiledly in itself, so far as is possible, the goodness of the
   Silence, which dwells in innermost shrines. The Evil, then, is not even
   in Angels. But by punishing sinners are they evil? By this rule, then,
   the punishers of transgressors are evil, and those of the priests who
   shut out the profane from the Divine Mysteries. And yet, the being
   punished is not an evil, but the becoming worthy of punishment; nor the
   being deservedly expelled from Holy things, but the becoming accursed
   of God, and unholy and unfit for things un-defiled.

   SECTION XXIII.

   But, neither are the demons evil by nature; for, if they are evil by
   nature, neither are they from the Good, nor amongst things existing;
   nor, in fact, did they change from good, being by nature, and always,
   evil. Then, are they evil to themselves or to others? If to themselves,
   they also destroy themselves; but if to others, how destroying, or what
   destroying?--Essence, or power, or energy? If indeed Essence, in the
   first place, it is not contrary to nature; for they do not destroy
   things indestructible by nature, but things receptive of destruction.
   Then, neither is this an evil for every one, and in every case; but,
   not even any existing thing is destroyed, in so far as it is essence
   and nature, but by the defect of nature's order, the principle of
   harmony and proportion lacks the power to remain as it was. But the
   lack of strength is not complete, for the complete lack of power takes
   away even the disease and the subject; and such a disease will be even
   a destruction of itself; so that, such a thing is not an evil, but a
   defective good, for that which has no part of the Good will not be
   amongst things which exist. And with regard to the destruction of power
   and energy the principle is the same. Then, how are the demons, seeing
   they come into being from God, evil? For the Good brings forth and
   sustains good things. Yet they are called evil, some one may say. But
   not as they are (for they are from the Good, and obtained a good
   being), but, as they are not, by not having had strength, as the
   Oracles affirm, "to keep their first estate." For in what, tell me, do
   we affirm that the demons become evil, except in the ceasing in the
   habit and energy for good things Divine? Otherwise, if the demons are
   evil by nature, they are always evil; yet evil is unstable. Therefore,
   if they are always in the same condition, they are not evil; for to be
   ever the same is a characteristic of the Good. But, if they are not
   always evil, they are not evil by nature, but by wavering from the
   angelic good qualities. And they are not altogether without part in the
   good, in so far as they both are, and live and think, and in one
   word--as there is a sort of movement of aspiration in them. But they
   are said to be evil, by reason of their weakness as regards their
   action according to nature. The evil then, in them, is a turning aside
   and a stepping out of things befitting themselves, and a missing of
   aim, and imperfection and impotence, and a weakness and departure, and
   falling away from the power which preserves their integrity in them.
   Otherwise, what is evil in demons? An irrational anger--a senseless
   desire--a headlong fancy.--But these, even if they are in demons, are
   not altogether, nor in every respect, nor in themselves alone, evils.
   For even with regard to other living creatures, not the possession of
   these, but the loss, is both destruction to the creature, and an evil.
   But the possession saves, and makes to be, the nature of the living
   creature which possesses them. The tribe of demons then is not evil, so
   far as it is according to nature, but so far as it is not; and the
   whole good which was given to them was not changed, but themselves fell
   from the whole good given. And the angelic gifts which were given to
   them, we by no means affirm that they were changed, but they exist, and
   are complete, and all luminous, although the demons themselves do not
   see, through having blunted their powers of seeing good. So far as they
   are, they are both from the Good, and are good, and aspire to the
   Beautiful and the Good, by aspiring to the realities, Being, and Life,
   and Thought; and by the privation and departure and declension from the
   good things befitting them, they are called evil, and are evil as
   regards what they are not: and by aspiring to the non-existent, they
   aspire to the Evil.

   SECTION XXIV.

   But does some one say that souls are evil? If it be that they meet with
   evil things providentially, and with a view to their preservation, this
   is not an evil, but a good, and from the Good, Who makes even the evil
   good. But, if we say that souls become evil, in what respect do they
   become evil, except in the failure of their good habits and energies;
   and, by reason of their own lack of strength, missing their aim and
   tripping? For we also say, that the air around us becomes dark by
   failure and absence of light, and yet the light itself is always light,
   that which enlightens even the darkness. The Evil, then, is neither in
   demons nor in us, as an existent evil, but as a failure and dearth of
   the perfection of our own proper goods.

   SECTION XXV.

   But neither is the Evil in irrational creatures, for if you should take
   away anger and lust, and the other things which we speak of, and which
   are not absolutely evil in their own nature, the lion having lost his
   boldness and fierceness will not be a lion; and the dog, when he has
   become gentle to every body, will not be a dog, since to keep guard is
   a dog's duty, and to admit those of the household, but to drive away
   the stranger. So the fact that nature is not destroyed is not an evil,
   but a destruction of nature, weakness, and failure of the natural
   habitudes and energies and powers. And, if all things through
   generation in time have their perfection, the imperfect is not
   altogether contrary to universal nature.

   SECTION XXVI.

   But neither is the Evil in nature throughout, for if all the methods of
   nature are from universal nature, there is nothing contrary to it. But
   in each individual (nature) one thing will be according to nature, and
   another not according to nature. For one thing is contrary to nature in
   one, and another in another, and that which is according to nature to
   one, is to the other, contrary to nature. But malady of nature, that
   which is the contrary to nature, is the deprivation of things of
   nature. So that there is not an evil nature; but this is evil to
   nature, the inability to accomplish the things of one's proper nature.

   SECTION XXVII.

   But, neither is the Evil in bodies. For deformity and disease are a
   defect of form, and a deprivation of order. And this is not altogether
   an evil, but a less good; for if a dissolution of beauty and form and
   order become complete, the body itself will be gone. But that the body
   is not cause of baseness to the soul is evident, from the fact that
   baseness continues to coexist even without a body, as in demons. For
   this is evil to minds and souls and bodies, (viz.) the weakness and
   declension from the habitude of their own proper goods.

   SECTION XXVIII.

   But neither (a thing which they say over and over again) is the evil in
   matter, so far as it is matter. For even it participates in ornament
   and beauty and form. But if matter, being without these, by itself is
   without quality and without form, how does matter produce
   anything--matter, which, by itself, is impassive? Besides how is matter
   an evil? for, if it does not exist in any way whatever, it is neither
   good nor evil but if it is any how existing, and all things existing
   are from the Good, even it would be from the Good; and either the Good
   is productive of the Evil, or the Evil, as being from the Good, is
   good; or the Evil is capable of producing the Good; or even the Good,
   as from the Evil, is evil; or further, there are two first principles,
   and these suspended from another one head. And, if they say that matter
   is necessary, for a completion of the whole Cosmos, how is matter an
   evil? For the Evil is one thing, and the necessary [41] is another.
   But, how does He, Who is Good, bring anything to birth from the Evil?
   or, how is that, which needs the Good, evil? For the Evil shuns the
   nature of the Good. And how does matter, being evil, generate and
   nourish nature? For the Evil, quâ evil, neither generates, nor
   nourishes, nor solely produces, nor preserves anything.

   But, if they should say, that it does not make baseness in souls, but
   that they are dragged to it, how will this be true? for many of them
   look towards the good; and yet how did this take place, when matter was
   dragging them entirely to the Evil? So that the Evil in souls is not
   from matter, but from a disordered and discordant movement. But, if
   they say this further, that they invariably follow matter, and unstable
   matter is necessary for those who are unable to stand firmly by
   themselves, how is the Evil necessary, or the necessary an evil?

   SECTION XXIX.

   But neither is it this which we affirm--the "privation fights against
   the Good by its own power [42] "; for the complete privation is
   altogether powerless, and the partial has the power, not in respect of
   privation, but in so far as it is not a complete privation. For, whilst
   privation of good is partial, it is not, as yet, an evil, and when, it
   has become an accomplished fact, the nature of the evil has departed
   also.

   SECTION XXX.

   But, to speak briefly, the Good is from the one and the whole Cause,
   but the Evil is from many and partial defects. Almighty God knows the
   Evil qua good; and, with Him, the causes of the evils are powers
   producing good [43] . But, if the Evil is eternal, and creates, and has
   power, and is, and does, whence do these come to it? Is it either from
   the Good, or by the Good from the Evil, or by both from another cause?
   Everything that is according to nature comes into being from a defined
   cause. And if the Evil is without cause, and undefined, it is not
   according to nature. For there is not in nature what is contrary to
   nature; nor is there any raison d' etre for want of art in art. Is then
   the soul cause of things evil, as fire of burning, and does it fill
   everything that it happens to touch with baseness? Or, is the nature of
   the soul then good, but, by its energies, exists sometimes in one
   condition, and sometimes in another? If indeed by nature, even its
   existence is an evil, and whence then does it derive its existence? Or,
   is it from the good Cause creative of the whole universe? But, if from
   this, how is it essentially evil? For good are all things born of this.
   But if by energies, neither is this invariable, and if not, whence are
   the virtues? Since it (the soul) comes into being without even seeming
   good. It remains then that the Evil is a weakness and a falling short
   of the Good.

   SECTION XXXI.

   The Cause of things good is One. If the Evil is contrary to the Good,
   the many causes of the Evil, certainly those productive of things evil,
   are not principles and powers, but want of power, and want of strength,
   and a mixing of things dissimilar without proportion. Neither are
   things evil unmoved, and always in the same condition, but endless and
   undefined, and borne along in different things, and those endless. The
   Good will be beginning and end of all, even things evil, for, for the
   sake of the Good, are all things, both those that are good, and those
   that are contrary. For we do even these as desiring the Good (for no
   one does what he does with a view to the Evil), wherefore the Evil has
   not a subsistence, but a parasitical subsistence, coming into being for
   the sake of the Good, and not of itself.

   SECTION XXXII.

   It is to be laid down that being belongs to the Evil as an accident and
   by reason of something else, and not from its own origin, and thus that
   that which comes into being appears to be right, because it comes into
   being for the sake of the Good, but that in reality it is not right for
   the reason that we think that which is not good to be good. The desired
   is shewn to be one thing, and that which comes to pass is another. The
   Evil, then, is beside the path, and beside the mark, and beside nature,
   and beside cause, and beside beginning, and beside end, and beside
   limit, and beside intention, and beside purpose. The Evil then is
   privation and failure, and want of strength, and want of proportion,
   and want of attainment, and want of purpose; and without beauty, and
   without life, and without mind, and without reason, and without
   completeness, and without stability, and without cause, and without
   limit, and without production; and inactive, and without result, and
   disordered, and dissimilar, and limitless, and dark, and unessential,
   and being itself nothing in any manner of way whatever. How, in short,
   can evil do anything by its mixture with the Good? For that which is
   altogether without participation in the Good, neither is anything, nor
   is capable of anything. For, if the Good is both an actual thing and an
   object of desire, and powerful and effective, how will the contrary to
   the Good,--that which has been deprived of essence, and intention, and
   power, and energy,--be capable of anything? Not all things are evil to
   all, nor the same things evil in every respect. To a demon, evil is to
   be contrary to the good-like mind--to a soul, to be contrary to
   reason--to a body, to be contrary to nature.

   SECTION XXXIII.

   How, in short, are there evils when there is a Providence? The Evil,
   qua evil, is not, neither as an actual thing nor as in things existing.
   And no single thing is without a Providence. For neither is the Evil an
   actual thing existing unmixed with the Good. And, if no single thing is
   without participation in the Good, but the lack of the Good is an evil,
   and no existing thing is deprived absolutely of the Good, the Divine
   Providence is in all existing things, and no single thing is without
   Providence. But Providence, as befits Its goodness, uses even evils
   which happen for the benefit, either individual or general, of
   themselves or others, and suitably provides for each being. Wherefore
   we will not admit the vain statement of the multitude, who say that
   Providence ought to lead us to virtue, even against our will. For to
   destroy nature is not a function of Providence. Hence, as Providence is
   conservative of the nature of each, it provides for the free, as free;
   and for the whole, and individuals, according to the wants of all and
   each, as far as the nature of those provided for admits the
   providential benefits of its universal and manifold Providence,
   distributed proportionably to each.

   SECTION XXXIV.

   The Evil, then, is not an actual thing, nor is the Evil in things
   existing. For the Evil, qua evil, is nowhere, and the fact that evil
   comes into being is not in consequence of power, but by reason of
   weakness. And, as for the demons, what they are is both from the Good,
   and good. But their evil is from the declension from their own proper
   goods, and a change--the weakness, as regards their identity and
   condition, of the angelic perfection befitting them. And they aspire to
   the Good, in so far as they aspire to be and to live and to think. And
   in so far as they do not aspire to the Good, they aspire to the
   non-existent; and this is not aspiration, but a missing of the true
   aspiration.

   SECTION XXXV.

   Now the Oracles call conscious transgressors those who are thoroughly
   weak as regards the ever memorable knowledge or the practise of the
   Good, and who, knowing the will, do not perform it,--those who are
   hearers indeed, but are weak concerning the faith, or the energy of the
   Good. And for some, it is against their will to understand to do good,
   by reason of the deviation or weakness of the will. And in short, the
   Evil (as we have often said) is want of strength and want of power, and
   defect, either of the knowledge, or the never to be forgotten
   knowledge, or of the faith, or of the aspiration, or of the energy of
   the Good. Yet, some one may say, the weakness is not punishable, but on
   the contrary is pardonable. Now, if the power were not granted, the
   statement might hold good; but, if power comes from the Good, Who
   giveth, according to the Oracles, the things suitable to all
   absolutely, the failure and deviation, and departure and declension of
   the possession from the Good of our own proper goods is not
   praiseworthy. But let these things suffice to have been sufficiently
   said according to our ability in our writings "Concerning just and
   Divine chastisement" throughout which sacred treatise the infallibility
   of the Oracles has cast aside those sophistical statements as senseless
   words, speaking injustice and falsehood against Almighty God. But now,
   according to our ability, the Good has been sufficiently praised, as
   really lovable,--as beginning and end of all--as embracing things
   existing--as giving form to things not existing--as Cause of all good
   things--as guiltless of things evil--as Providence and Goodness
   complete--and soaring above things that are and things that are
   not--and turning to good things evil, and the privation of Itself--as
   by all desired, and loved, and esteemed, and whatever else, the true
   statement, as I deem, has demonstrated in the preceding.

  CAPUT V.

   Concerning Being--in which also concerning Exemplars.

   SECTION I.

   LET us now then pass to the name "Being"--given in the Oracles as
   veritably that of Him, Who veritably is. But we will recall to your
   remembrance this much, that the purpose of our treatise is not to make
   known the superessential Essence--qua superessential--(for this is
   inexpressible, and unknowable, and altogether unrevealed, and
   surpassing the union itself), but to celebrate the progression of the
   supremely Divine Source of Essence, which gives essence to all things
   being. For the Divine Name of the Good, as making known the whole
   progressions of the Cause of all, is extended, both to things being,
   and things not being, and is above things being, and things not being.
   But the Name of Being is extended to all things being, and is above
   things being;--and the Name of Life is extended to all things living,
   and is above things living; and the Name of Wisdom is extended to all
   the intellectual and rational and sensible, and is above all these.

   SECTION II.

   The treatise, then, seeks to celebrate these, the Names of God, which
   set forth His Providence. For it does not profess to express the very
   superessential Goodness, and Essence, and Life, and Wisdom, of the very
   superessential Deity, Which is seated above all Goodness, and Deity,
   and Essence, and Wisdom, and Life,--in secret places, as the Oracles
   affirm. But it celebrates the beneficial Providence, which has been set
   forth as preeminently Goodness and Cause of all good things, and as
   Being, and Life, and Wisdom,--the Cause essentiating and vivifying, and
   wise-making, of those who partake of essence, and life, and mind, and
   reason, and sense. But it does not affirm that the Good is one thing,
   and the Being another; and that Life is other than Wisdom; nor that the
   Causes are many, and that some deities produce one thing and others
   another, as superior and inferior; but that the whole good progressions
   and the Names of God, celebrated by us, are of one God; and that the
   one epithet makes known the complete Providence of the one God, but
   that the others are indicative of His more general and more particular
   providences.

   SECTION III.

   Yet, some one might say, for what reason do we affirm that Life is
   superior to Being, and Wisdom to Life? Things with life no doubt are
   above things that merely exist--things sensible above those which
   merely live,--and things rational above these,--and the Minds [44]
   above the rational, and are around God, and are more near to Him. Yet,
   things which partake of greater gifts from God, must needs be better
   and superior to the rest. But if any one assumed the intellectual to be
   without being, and without life, the statement might hold good. But if
   the Divine Minds are both above all the rest of beings, and live above
   the other living beings, and think and know, above sensible perception
   and reason, and, beyond all the other existing beings, aspire to, and
   participate in, the Beautiful and Good, they are more around the Good,
   participating in It more abundantly, and having received larger and
   greater gifts from It. As also, the rational creatures excel those of
   sensible perception, by their superiority in the abundance of reason,
   and these, by their sensible perception, and others, by their life. And
   this, as I think, is true, that the things which participate more in
   the One and boundless-giving God, are more near to Him, and more
   divine, than those who come behind them (in gifts).

   SECTION IV.

   Now, since we are speaking of these things, come then, and let us
   praise the Good, as veritably Being, and giving essence to all things
   that be. He, Who is, is superessential, sustaining Cause of the whole
   potential Being, and Creator of being, existence, subsistence, essence,
   nature; Source and Measure of ages, and Framer of times, and Age of
   things that be, Time of things coming into being, Being of things
   howsoever being, Birth of things howsoever born. From Him, Who is, is
   age, and essence, and being, and time, and birth, and thing born; the
   realities in things that be, and things howsoever existing and
   subsisting. For Almighty God is not relatively a Being, but absolutely
   and unboundedly, having comprehended and anticipated the whole Being in
   Himself. Wherefore, He is also called King of the ages, since the whole
   being both is, and is sustained, in Him and around Him. And He neither
   was, nor will be, nor became, nor becomes, nor will become--yea rather,
   neither is. But He is the Being to things that be, and not things that
   be only, but the very being of things that be, absolutely from before
   the ages. For He is the Age of ages--the Existing before the ages.

   SECTION V.

   Summing up, then, let us say, that the being to all beings and to the
   ages, is from the Preexisting. And every age and time is from Him. And
   of every age and time, and of everything, howsoever existing, the
   Pre-existing is Source and Cause. And all things participate in Him,
   and from no single existing thing does He stand aloof. And He is before
   all things, and all things in Him consist. And absolutely, if anything
   is, in any way whatsoever, it both is, and is contemplated, and is
   preserved in the Pre-existing. And, before all the other participations
   in Him, the being is pre-supposed. And self-existent Being has
   precedence of the being self-existent Life; and the being self-existent
   Wisdom; and the being self-existent Divine Likeness; and the other
   beings, in whatever gifts participating, before all these participate
   in being; yea, rather, all self-existent things, of which existing
   things participate, participate in the self-existent Being. And there
   is nothing existent, of which the self-existent Being is not essence
   and age. Naturally, then, more chiefly than all the rest, Almighty God
   is celebrated as Being, from the prior of His other gifts; for
   pre-possessing even pre-existence, and super-existence, and
   super-possessing being, He pre-established all being, I mean
   self-existent being; and subjected everything, howsoever existing, to
   Being Itself. And then, all the sources of beings, as participating in
   being, both are, and are sources, and first are, and then are sources.
   And, if you wish to say, that the self-existent Life is source of
   living things, as living; and the self-existent Similitude, of things
   similar as similar; and the self-existent Union, of things united, as
   united; and the self-existent Order, of things ordered, as ordered and
   of the rest, as many as, by participating in this or that, or both, or
   many, are this or that, or both, or many, you will find the
   self-existent participations themselves, first participating in being,
   and by their being, first remaining;--then being sources of this or
   that, and by their participating in being, both being, and being
   participated. But, if these are by their participation of being, much
   more the things participating in them.

   SECTION VI.

   The self-existent Super-goodness then, as projecting the first gift of
   self-existent being, is celebrated by the elder and first of the
   participations; and being itself is from It, and in It; as also the
   sources of things being, and all the things that be, and the things
   howsoever sustained by being, and that irresistibly, and
   comprehensively and uniformly. For even in a monad, every number
   preexists in the form of a unit, and the monad holds every number in
   itself singly. And every number is united in the monad, but so far as
   it advances from the monad, so far it is distributed and multiplied.
   And in a centre, all the lines [45] of the circle coexist within one
   union, and the point holds all the straight lines in itself, uniformly
   united, both to each other, and to the one source from which they
   proceeded, and in the centre itself they are completely united; but
   standing slightly distant from it, they are slightly separated; but
   when more apart, more so. And in one word, the nearer they are to the
   centre, the more they are united to it and to each other? and the more
   they stand apart from it, the more they stand apart from each other.

   SECTION VII.

   But all the proportions of nature individually are comprehended in the
   whole nature of the whole, within one unconfused union; and in the
   soul, the powers of each several part are provident of the whole body
   in a uniform fashion. There is nothing out of place then, that, by
   ascending from obscure images to the Cause of all, we should
   contemplate, with supermundane eyes, all things in the Cause of all,
   even those contrary to each other, after a single fashion and unitedly.
   For It is Source of things existing, from which are both being itself,
   and all things however being; every source, every term, every life,
   every immortality, every wisdom, every order, every harmony, every
   power, every protection, every stability, every endurance, every
   conception, every word, every sensible perception, every habit, every
   standing, every movement, every union, every mingling, every
   friendship, every agreement, every difference, every limit, and
   whatever other things existing by being, characterize all things being.

   SECTION VIII.

   And from the same Cause of all, are the higher and lower intellectual
   [46] essences of the godlike angels; and those of the souls; and the
   natures of the whole Cosmos; all things whatsoever said to be either in
   others, or by reflection. Yea, even the all holy and most honoured
   Powers veritably being, and established, as it were, in the vestibule
   of the superessential Triad, are from It, and in It; and have the being
   and the godlike being; and after them, as regards Angels, the
   subordinate, subordinately, and the remotest, most remotely, but as
   regards ourselves, supermundanely. And the souls, and all the other
   beings, according to the same rule, have their being, and their
   well-being; and are, and are well; by having from the Pre-existing
   their being and their well-being. And in It are both being and
   well-being; and from It, beginning; and in It, guarded; and to It,
   terminated. And the prerogatives of being he distributes to the
   superior beings, which the Oracles call even eternal. But being itself
   never at any time fails all existing beings. And even self-existent
   being is from the Pre-existent, and of Him is being, and He is not of
   being;--and in Him is being, and He is not in being; and being
   possesses Him, and not He possesses being; and He is both age and
   beginning, and measure of being; being essentiating Source, and Middle
   and End, of pre-essence, and being and age and all things. And for this
   reason, by the Oracles, the veritably Pre-existing is represented under
   many forms, according to every conception of beings, and the "Was" and
   the "Is," and the "Will be," and the "Became," and the "Becomes," and
   the "Will become," are properly sung respecting Him. For all these, to
   those who think worthily of God, signify by every conception His being
   superessentially, and Cause in every way of things existing. For He is
   not this, but not that; nor is He in some way, but not in some other;
   but He is all things, as Cause of all, and containing and pre-holding
   in Himself all governments, all controls, of all existing things. And
   He is above all, as superessentially super-being before all. Wherefore,
   also, all things are predicated of Him and together, and He is none of
   them all; of every shape, of every kind, without form, without beauty,
   anticipating in Himself, beginnings and middles, and ends of things
   existing, irresistibly and preeminently; and shedding forth without
   flaw, (the light of) being to all, as beseems a One and super-united
   Cause. For, if our sun, at the same time that he is one and sheds a
   uniform light, renews the essences and qualities of sensible creatures,
   although they are many and various, and nourishes and guards, and
   perfects and distinguishes, and unites, and fosters, and makes to be
   productive, and increases, and transforms, and establishes, and makes
   to grow, and awakens, and gives life to all; and each of the whole, in
   a manner appropriate to itself, participates in the same and one sun;
   and the one sun anticipated in himself, uniformly, the causes of the
   many participants; much more with regard to the Cause of it and of all
   things, ought we to concede that It first presides over, as beseems One
   superessential Oneness, all the exemplars, of things existing; since He
   produces even essences, as beseems the egression from essence. But, we
   affirm that the exemplars are the methods in God, giving essence to
   things that be, and pre-existing uniformly, which theology calls
   predeterminations, and Divine and good wills, which define and produce
   things existing; according to which (predeterminations) the
   Superessential both predetermined and brought into existence everything
   that exists.

   SECTION IX.

   But, if the Philosopher Clemens thinks good, that the higher amongst
   beings should be called exemplars in relation to something, his
   statement advances, not through correct and perfect and simple names.
   But, when we have conceded even this, to be correctly said, we must
   call to mind the Word of God, which says, "I have not shewn thee these
   things for the purpose of going after them, but that through the
   proportionate knowledge of these we may be led up to the Cause of all,
   as we are capable."

   We must attribute, then, all existing things to It, as beseems One
   Union pre-eminent above all, since by starting from Being, the
   essentiating Progression and Goodness, both penetrating all, and
   filling all things with Its own being, and rejoicing over all things
   being, pre-holds all things in Itself, rejecting all duplicity by an
   one superfluity of simplicity. But It grasps all things in the same
   way, as beseems its super-simplified Infinity, and is participated in
   by all uniquely, even as a voice, whilst being one and the same, is
   participated in by many ears as one.

   SECTION X.

   The Pre-existing then is beginning and end of existing things;
   beginning indeed as Cause, and end as for whom; and term of all, and
   infinitude of all infinitude; and term, especially, of things that are,
   as it were, opposed. For in One, as we have often said, He both
   pre-holds and sustains all existing things, being present to all, and
   everywhere, both as regards the one, and the same, and as the every
   same, and issuing forth to all, and abiding in Himself; and standing
   and moving, and neither standing nor moving; neither having beginning,
   or middle, or end; neither in any of the existing things, nor being any
   of the existing things. And neither does any of the things eternally
   existing, or those temporarily subsisting, entirely come up to Him, but
   He towers above time and eternity, and all things eternal and temporal.
   Wherefore also, He is Eternity itself, and things existing, and the
   measures of things existing, and things measured through Him and from
   Him. But let us speak of these things more opportunely on another
   occasion.

  CAPUT VI.

   Concerning Life.

   SECTION I.

   Now let us sing the Eternal Life, from which comes the self-existing
   Life, and every life; and from which, to all things however partaking
   of life, is distributed the power to live appropriately to each.
   Certainly the life; and the immortality of the immortal Angels, and the
   very indestructibility of the angelic perpetual motion, both is, and is
   sustained from It, and by reason of It. Wherefore, they are also called
   living always and immortal; and again, not immortal, because not from
   themselves have they their immortality and eternal life; but from the
   vivifying Cause forming and sustaining all life; and as we said of Him,
   Who is, that He is Age even of the self-existing Being, so also here
   again (we say) that the Divine Life, which is above life, is
   life-giving and sustaining even of the self-existing Life; and every
   life and life-giving movement is from the Life which is above every
   life, and all source of all life. From It, even the souls have their
   indestructibility, and all living creatures, and plants in their most
   remote echo of life, have their power to live. And when It is "taken
   away," according to the Divine saying, all life fails, and to It even
   things that have failed, through their inability to participate in It,
   when again returning, again become living creatures.

   SECTION II.

   And It gives chiefly to the self-existing Life to be a life, and to
   every life, and to the individual life, that each should be conformable
   to that which nature intended it to be. And to the supercelestial lives
   It gives the immaterial and godlike, and unchangeable immortality; and
   the unswerving and undeviating perpetual movement; whilst extending
   Itself through excess of goodness, even to the life of demons [47] .
   For, neither has this its being from another cause, but from It life
   has both its being and its continuance. Further, It bequeaths even to
   men the angelic life, so far as is possible to compound being, and
   through an overflowing love towards man turns, and calls us back to
   Itself, even when we are departing from It; and, what is still more
   Divine, promises to transfer even our whole selves (I mean souls, and
   bodies their yoke-fellows), to a perfect life and immortality;--a fact
   which perhaps seems to Antiquity contrary to nature, but to me, and to
   thee, and to the truth, both Divine and above nature. But, by "above
   nature," I understand our visible nature, not the all-powerful nature
   of the Divine Life. For, to this, as being nature of all the living
   creatures, and especially the more Divine, no life is against nature,
   or above nature. So that the contradictory statements of Simon's folly
   on this matter, let them be far repelled from a Divine assembly, and
   from thy reverent soul. For this escaped him, as I imagine, whilst
   thinking to be wise, that the right-thinking man ought not to use the
   visible reason of the sensible perception, as an ally against the
   invisible Cause of all; and this must be our reply to him, that his
   statement is against nature, for to It nothing is contrary.

   SECTION III.

   From It, both all living creatures and plants draw their life and
   nourishment; and whether you speak of intellectual, or rational, or
   sensible, or nourishing, or growing, or whatever, life, or source of
   life, or essence of life, from It, which is above every life, it both
   lives and thrives; and in It, as Cause, uniformly pre-existed. For the
   super-living, and life-springing Life is Cause both of all life, and is
   generative, and completive, and dividing of life, and is to be
   celebrated from every life, in consequence of its numerous generation
   of all lives, as Manifold, and contemplated, and sung by every life;
   and as without need, yea, rather, superfull of life, the Self-living,
   and above every life, causing to live and super-living, or in whatever
   way one might extol the life which is unutterable by human speech.

  CAPUT VII.

   Concerning Wisdom, Mind, Reason, Truth, faith.

   SECTION I.

   COME then, if you please, let us sing the good and eternal Life, both
   as wise, and as wisdom's self; yea, rather, as sustaining all wisdom,
   and being superior to all wisdom and understanding. For, not only is
   Almighty God superfull of wisdom, and of His understanding there is no
   number, but He is fixed above all reason and mind and wisdom. And, when
   the truly divine man, the common sun of us, and of our leader, had
   thought this out, in a sense above nature, he says, "the foolishness of
   God is wiser than men," (meaning) not only that all human intelligence
   is a sort of error, when tried by the stability and durability of the
   Divine and most perfect conceptions, but that it is even usual with the
   theologians to deny, with respect to God, things of privation, in an
   opposite sense. Thus, the Oracles declare, the All-luminous Light,
   invisible, and Him, Who is often sung, and of many names, to be
   unutterable and without name, and Him, Who is present to all, and is
   found of all, to be incomprehensible and past finding out. In this very
   way, even now, the Divine Apostle is said to have celebrated as
   "foolishness of God," that which appears unexpected and absurd in it,
   (but) which leads to the truth which is unutterable and before all
   reason. But, as I elsewhere said, by taking the things above us, in a
   sense familiar to ourselves, and by being entangled by what is
   congenial to sensible perceptions, and by comparing things Divine with
   our own conditions, we are led astray through following the Divine and
   mystical reason after a mere appearance. We ought to know that our mind
   has the power for thought, through which it views things intellectual,
   but that the union through which it is brought into contact with things
   beyond itself surpasses the nature of the mind. We must then
   contemplate things Divine, after this Union, not after ourselves, but
   by our whole selves, standing out of our whole selves, and becoming
   wholly of God. For it is better to be of God, and not of ourselves. For
   thus things Divine will, be given to those who become dear to God.
   Celebrating then, in a superlative sense, this, the irrational and
   mindless and foolish Wisdom, we affirm that It is Cause of all mind and
   reason, and all wisdom and understanding; and of It is every counsel,
   and from It every knowledge and understanding; and in It all the
   treasures of wisdom and knowledge are hidden. For, agreeably to the
   things already spoken, the super-wise, and all-wise Cause is a mainstay
   [48] even of the self-existing Wisdom, both the universal and the
   individual.

   SECTION II.

   From It the contemplated and contemplating powers of the angelic Minds
   have their simple and blessed conceptions; collecting their divine
   knowledge, not in portions, or from portions, or sensible perceptions,
   or detailed reasonings, or arguing from something common to these
   things, but purified from everything material and multitudinous, they
   contemplate the conceptions of Divine things intuitively, immaterially
   and uniformly, and they have their intellectual power and energy
   resplendent with the unmixed and undefiled purity, and see at a glance
   the Divine conceptions indivisibly and immaterially, and are by the
   Godlike One moulded, as attainable by reason of the Divine Wisdom, to
   the Divine and Super-wise Mind and Reason. And souls have their
   reasoning power, investigating the truth of things by detailed steps
   and rotation, and through their divided and manifold variety falling
   short of the single minds, but, by the collection of many towards the
   One, deemed worthy, even of conceptions equal to the angels, so far as
   is proper and attainable to souls. But, even as regards the sensible
   perceptions themselves, one would not miss the mark, if one called them
   an echo of wisdom. Yet, even the mind of demons, qua mind, is from It;
   but so far as a mind is irrational, not knowing, and not wishing to
   attain what it aspires to, we must call it more properly a declension
   from wisdom. But, since the Divine Wisdom is called source, and cause,
   and mainstay, and completion and guard, and term of wisdom itself, and
   of every kind, and of every mind and reason, and every sensible
   perception, how then is Almighty God Himself, the super-wise,
   celebrated as Mind and Reason and Knowledge? For, how will He conceive
   any of the objects of intelligence, seeing He has not intellectual
   operations? or how will He know the objects of sense, seeing He is
   fixed above all sensible perception? Yet the Oracles affirm that He
   knoweth all things, and that nothing escapes the Divine Knowledge. But,
   as I have been accustomed to say many times before, we must contemplate
   things Divine, in a manner becoming God. For the mindless, and the
   insensible, we must attribute to God, by excess--not by defect, just as
   we attribute the irrational to Him Who is above reason; and
   imperfection, to the Super-perfect, and Pre-perfect; and the
   impalpable, and invisible gloom, to the light which is inaccessible on
   account of excess of the visible light. So the Divine Mind comprehends
   all things, by His knowledge surpassing all, having anticipated within
   Himself the knowledge of all, as beseems the Cause of all; before
   angels came to being, knowing and producing angels; and knowing all the
   rest from within; and, so to speak, from the Source Itself, and by
   bringing into being. And, this, I think, the sacred text teaches, when
   it says, "He, knowing all things, before their birth." For, not as
   learning existing things from existing things, does the Divine Mind
   know, but from Itself, and in Itself, as Cause, it pre-holds and
   pre-comprehends the notion and knowledge, and essence of all things;
   not approaching each several thing according to its kind, but knowing
   and containing all things, within one grasp of the Cause; just as the
   light, as cause, presupposes in itself the notion of darkness, not
   knowing the darkness otherwise than from the light. The Divine Wisdom
   then, by knowing Itself, will know all things; things material,
   immaterially, and things divisible, indivisibly, and things many,
   uniformly; both knowing and producing all. things by Itself, the One.
   For even, if as becomes one Cause, Almighty God distributes being to
   all things that be, as beseems the self-same, unique Cause, He will
   know all things, as being from Himself, and pre-established in Himself,
   and not from things that be will He receive the knowledge of them; but
   even to each of them, He will be provider of the knowledge of
   themselves, and of the mutual knowledge of each other. Almighty God,
   then, has not one knowledge, that of Himself, peculiar to Himself, and
   another, which embraces in common all things existing; for the very
   Cause of all things, by knowing Itself, will hardly, I presume, be
   ignorant of the things from Itself, and of which It is Cause. In this
   way then, Almighty God knows existing things, not by a knowledge of
   things existing, but by that of Himself. For the Oracles affirm, that
   the angels also know things on the earth, not as knowing them by
   sensible perceptions, although objects of sensible perception, but by a
   proper power and nature of the Godlike Mind.

   SECTION III.

   In addition to these things, we must examine how we know God, Who is
   neither an object of intellectual nor of sensible perception, nor is
   absolutely anything of things existing. Never, then, is it true to say,
   that we know God; not from His own nature (for that is unknown, and
   surpasses all reason and mind), but, from the ordering of all existing
   things, as projected from Himself, and containing a sort of images and
   similitudes of His Divine exemplars, we ascend, as far as we have
   power, to that which is beyond all, by method and order in the
   abstraction and pre-eminence of all, and in the Cause of all.
   Wherefore, Almighty God is known even in all, and apart from all. And
   through knowledge, Almighty God is known, and through agnosia. And
   there is, of Him, both conception, and expression, and science, and
   contact, and sensible perception, and opinion, and imagination, and
   name, and all the rest. And He is neither conceived, nor expressed, nor
   named. And He is not any of existing things, nor is He known in any one
   of existing things. And He is all in all, and nothing in none. And He
   is known to all, from all, and to none from none. For, we both say
   these things correctly concerning God, and He is celebrated from all
   existing things, according to the analogy of all things, of which He is
   Cause. And there is, further, the most Divine Knowledge of Almighty
   God, which is known, through not knowing (agnosia) during the union
   above mind; when the mind, having stood apart from all existing things,
   then having dismissed also itself, has been made one with the
   super-luminous rays, thence and there being illuminated by the
   unsearchable depth of wisdom. Yet, even from all things, as I said, we
   may know It, for It is, according to the sacred text, the Cause
   formative of all, and ever harmonizing all, and (Cause) of the
   indissoluble adaptation and order of all, and ever uniting [49] the
   ends of the former to the beginnings of those that follow, and
   beautifying the one symphony and harmony of the whole.

   SECTION IV.

   But Almighty God is celebrated in the holy Oracles as "Logos"; not only
   because He is provider of reason and mind and wisdom, but because He
   anticipated the causes of all, solitarily in Himself, and because He
   passes through all, as the Oracles say, even to the end of all things;
   and even more than these, because the Divine Word surpasses every
   simplicity, and is set free from all, as the Superessential. This
   "Logos "is the simple and really existing truth, around which, as a
   pure and unerring knowledge of the whole, the Divine Faith is--the
   enduring foundation of the believers--which establishes them in the
   truth, and the truth in them, by an unchangeable identity, they having
   the pure knowledge of the truth of the things believed. For, if
   knowledge unites the knowing and the known, but ignorance is ever a
   cause to the ignorant person of change, and of separation from himself,
   nothing will move one who has believed in the truth, according to the
   sacred Logos, from true Faith's Sanctuary upon which he will have the
   steadfastness of his unmoved, unchangeable identity. For, well does he
   know, who has been united to the Truth, that it is well with him
   although the multitude may admonish him as "wandering." For it probably
   escapes them, that he is wandering from error to the truth, through the
   veritable faith. But, he truly knows himself, not, as they say, mad,
   but as liberated from the unstable and variable course around the
   manifold variety of error, through the simple, and ever the same, and
   similar truth. Thus then the early leaders [50] of our Divine Theosophy
   are dying every day, on behalf of truth, testifying as is natural, both
   by every word and deed, to the one knowledge of the truth of the
   Christians, that it is of all, both more simple and more Divine, yea
   rather, that it is the sole true and one and simple knowledge of God.

  CAPUT VIII.

   Concerning power, justice, preservation, redemption, in which also
   concerning inequality.

   SECTION I.

   BUT since the theologians sing the Divine truth fulness and super-wise
   wisdom, both as power and as justice, and designate It preservation and
   redemption, come then, let us unfold these Divine Names also, as best
   we can. Now, that the Godhead is pre-eminent above, and surpasses every
   power, howsoever being and conceived, I do not suppose any of those
   nourished in the Divine Oracles does not know. For on many occasions
   the Word of God attributes the Lordship to It, even when distinguishing
   It from the supercelestial powers themselves. How then do the
   theologians sing it also as a Power, which is pre-eminent above every
   power? or how ought we to understand the name of power as applied to
   It?

   SECTION II.

   We say, then, that Almighty God is Power, as pre-having, and
   super-having, every power in Himself, and as Author of every power, and
   producing everything as beseems a Power inflexible and unencompassed,
   and as being Author of the very existence of power, either the
   universal or particular, and as boundless in power, not only by the
   production of all power, but by being above all, even the self.
   existent Power, and by His superior power, and by His bringing into
   existence, ad infinitum, endless powers other than the existing powers;
   and by the fact that the endless powers, even when brought into
   existence without end, are not able to blunt the super-endless
   production of His power-making power; and by the unutterable and
   unknown, and inconceivable nature of His all-surpassing power, which,
   through abundance of the powerful, gives power even to weakness, and
   holds together and preserves the remotest of its echoes; as also we may
   see even with regard to the powerful insensible perception, that the
   super-brilliant lights reach even to obscure visions, and they say,
   that the loud sounds enter even into ears which are not very well
   adapted to the reception of sounds. For that which does not hear at all
   is not hearing; and that which does not see at all is not sight.

   SECTION III.

   The distribution, then, of boundless power, from Almighty God, passes
   to all beings, and there is no single being which is utterly deprived
   of the possession of some power; but it has either intellectual, or
   rational, or sensible, or vital, or essential power; yea even, if one
   may say so, self-existent being has power to be from the superessential
   Power.

   SECTION IV.

   From It, are the godlike powers of the angelic ranks; from It, they
   have their immutability, and all their intellectual and immortal
   perpetual movements; and their equilibrium itself, and their
   undiminishable aspiration after good, they have received from the Power
   boundless in goodness; since It commits to them the power to be, and to
   be such, and to aspire always to be, and the power itself to aspire to
   have the power always.

   SECTION V.

   But the gifts of the unfailing Power pass on, both to men and living
   creatures, and plants, and the entire nature of the universe; and It
   empowers things united for their mutual friendship and communion, and
   things divided for their being each within their own sphere and limit,
   without confusion, and without mingling; and preserves the order and
   good relations of the whole, for their own proper good, and guards the
   undying lives of the individual angels inviolate; and the heavenly and
   the life-giving and astral bodies [51] and orders without change: and
   makes the period of time possible to be; and disperses the revolutions
   of time by their progressions, and collects them together by their
   returns; and makes the powers of fire unquenchable, and the rills of
   water unfailing; and sets bounds to the aerial current, and establishes
   the earth upon nothing; and guards its life-giving throes from
   perishing; and preserves the mutual harmony and mingling of the
   elements without confusion, and without division; and holds together
   the bond of soul and body; and arouses the nourishing and growing
   powers of plants; and sustains the essential powers of the whole; and
   secures the continuance of the universe without dissolution, and
   bequeaths the deification Itself, by furnishing a power for this to
   those who are being deified. And in a word, there is absolutely no
   single thing which is deprived of the overruling surety and embrace of
   the Divine Power. For that which absolutely has no power, neither is,
   nor is anything, nor is there any sort of position of it whatever.

   SECTION VI.

   Yet Elymas, the Magician, says, "if Almighty God is All-powerful, how
   is He said by your theologian, not to be able to do some thing "? But
   he calumniates the Divine Paul, who said, "that Almighty God is not
   able to deny Himself." Now in advancing this, I very much fear lest I
   should incur ridicule for folly, as undertaking to pull down frail
   houses, built upon the sand by little boys at play; and as being eager
   to aim at the theological intelligence of this, as if it were some
   inaccessible mark. For, the denial of Himself, is a falling from truth,
   but the truth is an existent, and the falling from the truth is a
   falling from the existent. If, then, the truth is an existent, and the
   denial of the truth a falling from the existent, Almighty God cannot
   fall from the existent, and non-existence is not; as any one might say,
   the powerless is not powerful; and ignorance, by privation, does not
   know. The wise man, not having understood this, imitates those
   inexperienced wrestlers, who, very often, by assuming that their
   adversaries are weak, according to their own opinion, and manfully
   making a show of fight with them, when absent, and courageously beating
   the air with empty blows, think that they have overcome their
   antagonists, and proclaim themselves victors (though) not yet having
   experienced their rivals' strength. But we, conjecturing the meaning of
   the Theologian to the best of our ability, celebrate the Super-powerful
   God, as Omnipotent, as blessed, and only Lord; as reigning in the
   kingdom of Eternity itself; as in no respect fallen from things
   existing;--but rather, as both super-having and pre-having all existing
   things, as beseems Power superessential; and as having bequeathed to
   all things being, the power to be, and this their being in an
   ungrudging stream, as beseems abundance of surpassing power.

   SECTION VII.

   But further, Almighty God is celebrated as justice, as distributing
   things suitable to all, both due measure, and beauty, and good order,
   and arrangement, and marking out all distributions and orders for each,
   according to that which truly is the most just limit, and as being
   Cause for all of the free action of each. For the Divine Justice
   arranges and disposes all things, and preserving all things unmingled
   and unconfused, from all, gives to all existing beings things
   convenient for each, according to the due falling to each existing
   thing. And, if we speak correctly, all those who abuse the Divine
   Justice, unconsciously convict themselves of a manifest injustice. For
   they say, that immortality ought to be in mortals, and perfection in
   the imperfect, and imposed necessity in the free, and identity in the
   variable, and perfect power in the weak, and the temporal should be
   eternal, and things moveable by nature, unchangeable, and that
   temporary pleasures should be eternal; and in one word, they assign the
   properties of one thing to another. They ought to know that the Divine
   Justice in this respect is really a true justice, because it
   distributes to all the things proper to themselves, according to the
   fitness of each existing thing, and preserves the nature of each in its
   own order and capacity.

   SECTION VIII.

   But some one may say, it is not the mark of justice to leave pious men
   without assistance, when they are ground down by evil men. To which we
   must reply, that, if those whom you call pious do indeed love things on
   earth, which are zealously sought after by the earthly, they have
   altogether fallen from the Divine Love. And I do not know how they
   could be called pious, when they unjustly treat things truly loveable
   and divine, which do not at once surpass in influence in their
   estimation things undesirable and unloveable. But, if they love the
   realities, they who desire certain things ought to rejoice when they
   attain the things desired. Are they not then nearer the angelic
   virtues, when, as far as possible, by aspiration after things Divine,
   they withdraw from the affection for earthly things, by being exercised
   very manfully to this, in their perils, on behalf of the beautiful? So
   that, it is true to say, that this is rather a property of the Divine
   Justice--not to pamper and destroy the bravery of the best, by the
   gifts of earthly things, nor, if any one should attempt to do this, to
   leave them without assistance, but to establish them in the excellent
   and harsh condition, and to dispense to them, as being such, things
   meet for them.

   SECTION IX.

   This Divine Justice, then, is celebrated also even as preservation of
   the whole, as preserving and guarding the essence and order of each,
   distinct and pure from the rest; and as being genuine cause of each
   minding its own business in the whole. But, if any one should also
   celebrate this preservation, as rescuing savingly the whole from the
   worse, we will entirely accept this as the cantique of the manifold
   preservation, and we will deem him worthy to define this even as the
   principal preservation of the whole, which preserves all things in
   themselves, without change, undisturbed and unswaying to the worse; and
   guards all things without strife and without war, each being regulated
   by their own methods; and excludes all inequality and minding others'
   business, from the whole; and maintains the relations of each from
   falling to things contrary, and from migrating. And since, without
   missing the mark of the sacred theology, one might celebrate this
   preservation as redeeming all things existing, by the goodness which is
   preservative of all, from falling away from their own proper goods, so
   far as the nature of each of those who are being preserved admits;
   wherefore also the Theologians name it redemption, both so far as it
   does not permit things really being to fall away to non-existence, and
   so far as, if anything should have been led astray to discord and
   disorder, and should suffer any diminution of the perfection of its own
   proper goods, even this it redeems from passion and listlessness and
   loss; supplying what is deficient, and paternally overlooking the
   slackness, and raising up from evil; yea, rather, establishing in the
   good, and filling -up the leaking good, and arranging and adorning its
   disorder and deformity, and making it complete, and liberating it from
   all its blemishes. But let this suffice concerning these matters, and
   concerning Justice, in accordance with which the equality of all is
   measured and defined, and every inequality, which arises from
   deprivation of the equality, in each thing severally, is excluded. For,
   if any one should interpret inequality as distinctions in the whole, of
   the whole, in relation to the whole, Justice guards even this, not
   permitting the whole, when they have become mingled throughout, to be
   thrown into confusion, but keeping all existing things within each
   particular kind, in which each was intended by nature, to be.

  CAPUT IX.

   Concerning great, small, same, different, similar, dissimilar,
   standing, movement, equality.

   SECTION I.

   BUT since even the great and the small are attributed to the Cause of
   all, arid the same, and the different, and the similar, and the
   dissimilar, and the standing, and the movement. Come! and let us gaze
   upon these images of the Divine Names, such as have been manifested to
   us. Almighty God, then, is celebrated in the Oracles as great, both in
   greatness and in a gentle breeze, which manifests the Divine
   littleness; and as the same, when the Oracles declare "thou art the
   same"; and as different, when He is depicted, by the same Oracles, as
   of many shapes and many forms; and as similar, as mainstay of things
   similar and similitude; and as dissimilar to all, as the like of whom
   there is not; and as standing, and unmoved, and seated for ever; and as
   moving, as going forth to all; and whatever other Divine Names, of the
   same force with these, are celebrated by the Oracles.

   SECTION II.

   Almighty God, then, is named great in reference to His own peculiar
   greatness, which imparts itself to all things great; and overflows, and
   extends itself outside of all greatness; embracing every place,
   surpassing every number, going through every infinitude, both in
   reference to its super-fulness, and mighty operation, and its fontal
   gifts, in so far as these, being participated by all in a stream of
   boundless gifts, are altogether undiminished, and have the same
   super-fulness, and are not lessened by the impartations, but are even
   still more bubbling over. This Greatness then is infinite, and without
   measure and without number. And this is the preeminence as regards the
   absolute and surpassing flood of the incomprehensible greatness.

   SECTION III.

   But little, i.e. fine, is affirmed respecting Him,--that which leaves
   behind every mass and distance, and penetrates through all, without
   hindrance. Yet the little is Elemental [52] Cause of all, for nowhere
   will you find the idea of the little unparticipated. Thus then the
   little must be received as regards God as penetrating to all, and
   through all, without impediment; and operating, and piercing through,
   to "a dividing of soul and spirit, and joints and marrow"; and
   "discerning thoughts and intents of heart," yea rather--all things that
   be. For there is not a creature unmanifest in His sight. This
   littleness is without quality and without quantity, without restraint,
   without limit, without bound, comprehending all things, but itself
   incomprehensible.

   SECTION IV.

   But the same is superessentially everlasting, inconvertible, abiding in
   itself, always being in the same condition and manner; present to all
   in the same manner, and itself by itself, upon itself, firmly and
   purely fixed in the most beautiful limits of the superessential
   sameness, without changing, without falling, without swerving,
   unalterable, unmingled, immaterial, most simplex, self-sufficient,
   without increase, without diminution, unoriginated, not as not yet come
   into being, or unperfected, or not having become from this, or that,
   nor as being in no manner of way whatever, but as all unoriginated, and
   absolutely unoriginated, and ever being; and being self-complete, and
   being the same by itself, and differentiated by itself in one sole and
   same form; and shedding sameness from itself to all things adapted to
   participate in It; and assigning things different to those different;
   abundance and cause of identity, preholding identically in itself even
   things contrary, as beseems the One and unique Cause, surpassing the
   whole identity.

   SECTION V.

   But the different, since Almighty God is present to all providentially,
   and becomes all in all, for the sake of the preservation of all,
   resting upon Himself, and His own identity within Himself, standing, as
   beseems an energy, one and ceaseless, and imparting Himself with an
   unbending power, for deification of those turned to Him. And we must
   suppose that the difference of the manifold shapes of Almighty God,
   during the multiform visions, signifies that certain things are
   different from the phenomena under which they appear. For, as when
   language depicts the soul itself, under a bodily form, and fashions
   bodily members around the memberless, we think differently of the
   members attributed to it, as befits the soul's memberless condition;
   and we call the mind head, and opinion neck,--as intermediate between
   rational and irrational--and anger, breast; and lust, belly; and the
   constitution, legs and feet; using the names of the members as symbols
   of the powers. Much more then, as respects Him, Who is beyond all, is
   it necessary to make clear the difference of forms and shapes by
   reverent and God-becoming, and mystic explanations. And if you wish to
   apply the threefold shapes of bodies to the impalpable and shapeless
   God, you must say, that the Progression of Almighty God, which spreads
   out to all things, is a Divine extension; and length, the power
   extending itself over the whole; and depth, the hiddenness and
   imperception incomprehensible to all creatures. But, that we may not
   forget ourselves, in our explanation, of the different shapes and
   forms, by confounding the incorporeal Divine Names with those given
   through symbols of objects of sense, we have for this reason spoken
   concerning these things in the Symbolic Theology. But now, let us
   suppose the Divine difference, as really not a sort of change from the
   super-immovable identity, but as the single multiplication of itself,
   and the uniform progressions of its fecundity to all.

   SECTION VI.

   But similar, if any one might speak of Almighty God as the same, as
   being wholly throughout, similar to Himself--abidingly and indivisibly;
   we must not despise the Divine Name of the Similar; but the Theologians
   affirm that the God above all, in His essential nature, is similar to
   none; but that He bequeaths a Divine similarity to those who turn to
   Him, Who is above every limit and expression, by imitation according to
   their capacity. And there is the power of the Divine similitude, which
   turns all created things to the Cause. These things, then, must be said
   to be similar to Almighty God, both after a Divine likeness and
   similitude. For, neither must we say that Almighty God is similar to
   them, because neither is a man like his own image. For, with regard to
   those of the same rank, it is possible that these should be similar to
   each other, and that the similarity corresponds to each, and that both
   are similar to each other, after a preceding appearance of like. But,
   with respect to the Cause and the things caused, we do not accept the
   correspondence. For, the being similar is bequeathed, not to these, or
   those, alone, but to all those who participate in similarity. Almighty
   God becomes Cause of their being similar, and is mainstay of the
   self-existing Similarity itself; and the similar in all is similar to a
   soft of footprint of the Divine Similarity and completes their Oneness.

   SECTION VII.

   And what must we say concerning this? For the Word of God Itself extols
   the fact that He is dissimilar, and of the same rank with none; as
   "different" even from everything, and, what is more paradoxical, says
   there is nothing that is similar to Him. Yet the expression is not
   contrary to the similarity towards Him, for the same things are both
   similar to God, and dissimilar--the former as regards the received
   imitation [53] of the inimitable, the latter as regards the dependence
   of the things caused upon the cause, and their being inferior in
   degrees, endless and incalculable.

   SECTION VIII.

   But what also do we say concerning the Divine standing, i.e. seat? What
   other than that Almighty God remains Himself, in Himself, and is
   abidingly fixed in unmoved identity, and is firmly established on high;
   and that He acts according to the same conditions, and in reference to
   the same object, and in the same way; and that He exists altogether, as
   beseems the immutability from Himself; and as beseems the immovability
   Itself, entirely immovable, and that superessentially. For He is Cause
   of the standing and sitting of all, Who is above all sitting and
   standing, and in Him all things consist, being kept from falling out of
   the state of their own proper goods.

   SECTION IX.

   But what again, when the Theologians say, that the unmoved goes forth
   to all, and is moved? Must we not understand this in a sense befitting
   God? For we must reverently suppose that He is moved, not as beseems
   carriage, or change, or alteration, or turning, or local movement, or
   the straight, or the circular, or that from both (curvative), or the
   intellectual, or the spiritual, or the physical, but that Almighty God
   brings into being and sustains everything, and provides in every way
   for everything; and is present, to all, by the irresistible embrace of
   all, and by His providential progressions and operations to all
   existing things. But we must concede to our discourse, to celebrate in
   a sense becoming God, even movements of God, the immovable. And the
   straight must be considered (to be) the unswerving and the undeviating
   progression of the operation, and the production from Himself of the
   whole; and the curvative--the steady progression and the productive
   condition; and the circular the same, and the holding together the
   middle and extremities, which encompass and are encompassed,--and the
   turning to Him of the things which proceeded from Him.

   SECTION X.

   But, if any one should take the Divine Name in the Oracles, of "the
   same," or that of "justice," in the sense of "the equal," we must say,
   that Almighty God is equal, not only as indivisible and unswerving, but
   also as going forth to all, and through all, equally; and as foundation
   of the self-existent Equality, in conformity with which, He equally
   effects the same passage, through all things mutually, and the
   participation of those who receive equally, according to the aptitude
   of each; and the equal gift distributed to all, according to due; and
   according as He has anticipated pre-eminently and uniquely in Himself,
   every equality, intelligible, intelligent, rational, sensible,
   essential, physical, voluntary, as beseems the Power over all, which is
   productive of every equality.

  CAPUT X.

   Concerning Sovereign Lord, "Ancient of days" in which also, concerning
   Age and Time [54] .

   SECTION I.

   THE time, then, is come for our discourse, to sing the God of many
   Names, as "Sovereign Lord," and as "Ancient of days." For He is called
   the former, by reason that He is an all-controlling basis, binding and
   embracing the whole, and establishing and supporting, and tightening,
   and completing the whole. Continuous in itself, and from itself,
   producing the whole, as it were from a Sovereign root, and turning to
   itself the whole, as to a sovereign parent stock, and holding them
   together as an all-embracing basis of all, securing all the things
   embraced, within one grasp superior to all, and not permitting them,
   when fallen from itself to be destroyed, as moved from an all-perfect
   sanctuary. But the Godhead is called Sovereign, both as controlling and
   governing the members of His household, purely, and as being desired
   and beloved by all, and as placing upon all the voluntary yokes, and
   the sweet pangs of the Divine and Sovereign, and in dissolvable love of
   the Goodness itself,

   SECTION II.

   But Almighty God is celebrated as "Ancient of days" because He is of
   all things both Age and Time,--and before Days, and before Age and
   Time. And yet we must affirm that He is Time and Day, and appointed
   Time, and Age, in a sense befitting God, as being throughout every
   movement unchangeable and unmoved, and in His ever moving remaining in
   Himself, and as being Author of Age and Time and Days. Wherefore, in
   the sacred Divine manifestations of the mystic visions, He is
   represented as both old and young; the former indeed signifying the
   "Ancient" and being from the beginning, and the latter His never
   growing old; or both teaching that He advances through all things from
   beginning to end,--or as our Divine initiator says, "since each
   manifests the priority of God, the Elder having the first place in
   Time, but the Younger the priority in number; because the unit, and
   things near the unit, are nearer the beginning than numbers further
   advanced.

   SECTION III.

   But we must, as I think, see from the Oracles the nature of Time and
   Eternity, for they do not always (merely) call all the things
   absolutely unoriginated and really everlasting, eternal, but also
   things imperishable and immortal and unchangeable, and things which are
   in like fashion, as when they say, "be ye opened, eternal doors," and
   the like. And often they characterize the things the most ancient by
   the name of Eternity; and again they call the whole duration of our
   time Eternity, in so far as the ancient and unchangeable, and the
   measurement of existence throughout, is a characteristic of Eternity.
   But they call time that concerned in generation and decay and change,
   and sometimes the one, and sometimes the other. Wherefore also, the
   Word of God says that even we, who are bounded here by time, shall
   partake of Eternity, when we have reached the Eternity which is
   imperishable and ever the same. But sometimes eternity is celebrated in
   the Oracles, even as temporal, and time as eternal. But if we know them
   better and more accurately, things spiritual [55] are spoken of and
   denoted by Eternity, and things subject to generation by time. It is
   necessary then to suppose that things called eternal are not absolutely
   co-eternal with God, Who is before Eternity, but that following
   unswervingly the most august Oracles, we should understand things
   eternal and temporal according to the hopes recognized by them, hut
   whatever participates partly in eternity and partly in time, as things
   midway between things spiritual and things being born. But Almighty God
   we ought to celebrate, both as eternity and time, as Author of every
   time and eternity, and "Ancient of days," as before time, and above
   time; and as changing appointed seasons and times; and again as being
   before ages, in so far as He is both before eternity and above eternity
   and His kingdom, a kingdom of all the Ages. Amen.

  CAPUT XI.

   Concerning Peace, and what is meant by the self-existent Being; what is
   the self-existent Life, and what the self-existent Power, and such like
   expressions.

   SECTION I.

   COME, then, let us extol the Peace Divine, and Source of conciliation,
   by hymns of peace! For this it is which unifies all, and engenders, and
   effects the agreement and fellowship of all. Wherefore, even all things
   aspire to it, which turns their divided multiplicity into the thorough
   Oneness, and unifies the tribal war of the whole into a homogeneous
   dwelling together, by the participation of the divine Peace. With
   regard, then, to the more reverend of the conciliating powers, these
   indeed are united to themselves and to each other, and to the one
   Source of Peace of the whole; and the things (that are) under them,
   these they unite also to themselves and to each other, and to the One
   and all-perfect Source and Cause of the Peace of all, which, passing
   in-divisibly to the whole, limits and terminates and secures
   everything, as if by a kind of bolts, which bind together things that
   are separated; and do not permit them, when separated, to rush to
   infinity and the boundless, and to become without order, and without
   stability, and destitute of God, and to depart from the union amongst
   themselves, and to become intermingled m each other, in every sort of
   confusion. Concerning then, this, the Divine Peace and Repose, which
   the holy Justus calls unutterableness, and, as compared with every
   known progression, immobility, how it rests and is at ease, and how it
   is in itself, and within itself, and entire, and to itself entire is
   super-united, and when entering into itself, and multiplying itself,
   neither loses its own Union, but even proceeds to all, whilst remaining
   entire within, by reason of excess of its Union surpassing all, it is
   neither permitted, nor attainable to any existing being, either to
   express or to understand. But, having premised this, as unutterable and
   unknowable, as being beyond all, let us examine its conceived and
   uttered participations, and this, as possible to men, and to us, as
   inferior to many good men.

   SECTION II.

   First then, this must be said, that It is mainstay of the self-existent
   Peace, both the general and the particular; and that It mingles all
   things with each other within their unconfused union, as beseems which,
   united indivisibly, and at the same time they severally continuously
   unmingled stand, as regards their own proper kind, not muddled through
   their mingling with the opposite, nor blunting any of their unifying
   distinctness and purity. Let us then contemplate a certain One and
   simple nature of the peaceful Union, unifying all things to Itself, and
   to themselves, and to each other; and preserving all things in an
   unconfused grasp of all, both unmingled and mingled together; by reason
   of which the divine Minds, being united,, are united to their own
   conceptions, and to the things conceived; and again they ascend to the
   unknowable contact of things fixed above mind; by reason of which,
   souls, by uniting their manifold reasonings, and collecting them
   together to an One intellectual Purity, advance in a manner proper to
   themselves, by method and order, through the immaterial and indivisible
   conception, to the union above conception; by reason of which, the one
   and indissoluble connection of all is established, within its Divine
   Harmony, and is harmonized by complete concord and agreement and
   fellowship, being united without confusion, and held together without
   division. For the fulness of the perfect Peace passes through to all
   existing things, as beseems the most simple, and unmingled presence of
   Its unifying power, making all One. and binding the extremes through
   the intermediate to the extremes, which are yoked together in an one
   connatural friendship; and bestowing the enjoyment of Itself, even to
   the furthest extremities of the whole, and making all things of one
   family, by the unities, the identities, the unions, the conjunctions of
   the Divine Peace, standing of course indivisibly, and showing all in
   one, and passing through all, and not stepping out of Its own identity.
   For It advances to all, and imparts Itself to all, in a manner
   appropriate to them, and there overflows an abundance of peaceful
   fertility; and It remains, through excess of union, super-united,
   entire, to and throughout Its whole self.

   SECTION III.

   But how, some one may say, do all things aspire to peace, for many
   things rejoice in diversity and division, and would not, at any time,
   of their own accord, be willingly in repose. Now, if in saying this, he
   affirms, that the identity of each existing thing is diversity and
   division, and that there is no existent thing whatever, which at any
   time is willing to destroy this (identity), neither would we in any way
   contradict this, but would declare even this an aspiration after peace.
   For all things love to dwell at peace, and to be united amongst
   themselves, and to be unmoved and unfallen from themselves, and the
   things of themselves. And the perfect Peace seeks to guard the
   idiosyncrasy of each unmoved and unconfused, by its peace-giving
   forethought, preserving everything unmoved and unconfused, both as
   regards themselves and each other, and establishes all things by a
   stable and unswerving power, towards their own peace and immobility.

   SECTION IV.

   And if all things in motion desire, not repose, but ever to make known
   their own proper movement, even this is an aspiration after the Divine
   Peace of the whole, which preserves all things from falling away of
   their own accord, and guards the idiosyncrasy and moving life of all
   moving things unmoved and free from falling, so that the things moved,
   being at peace amongst themselves, and always in the same condition,
   perform their own proper functions.

   SECTION V.

   But if, in affirming the diversity as a falling from peace, he insists
   that peace is not beloved by all, verily there is no existing being
   which has entirely fallen from every kind of union; for, the altogether
   unstable and infinite, and unestablished, and without limit, is neither
   an actual thing, nor in things actual. But if he says, that those are
   inimical to peace, and good things of peace, who rejoice in strife and
   anger and changes and disturbances, even these are controlled by
   obscure images of a peaceful aspiration; being vexed by tumultuous
   passions, and ignorantly aspiring to calm them, they imagine that they
   will pacify themselves by the gratification of things which ever elude
   them, and they are disturbed by the non-attainment of the pleasures
   which overpowered them. What would any one say of the peaceful stream
   of love towards man in Christ, according to which we have learned no
   longer to wage war, either with ourselves, or each other, or with
   angels, but that with them, according to our power, we should also be
   fellow-workers in Divine things, after the purpose of Jesus, Who
   worketh all in all, and forms a peace unutterable and pre-determined
   from Eternity, and reconciles us to Himself, in Spirit, and through
   Himself and in Himself to the Father; concerning which supernatural
   gifts it is sufficiently spoken in the Theological Outlines, whilst the
   Oracles of the sacred inspiration furnish us with additional testimony.

   SECTION VI.

   But, since you once asked me by letter, what in the world I consider
   the self-existent Being, the self-existent Life, the self-existent
   Wisdom, and said that you debated with yourself how, at one time, I
   call Almighty God, self-existent Life, and at another, Mainstay of the
   self-existent Life, I thought it necessary, O holy man of God, to also
   free you from this difficulty, so far as lay in my power. And first
   then, in order that we may now resume that which I have said a thousand
   times already, there is no contradiction in saying that Almighty God is
   self-existent Power, or self-existent Life, and that He is Mainstay of
   the self-existent Life or Peace or Power. For the latter, He is named
   from things existing, and specially from the first existing, as Cause
   of all existing things; and the former, as being above all, even the
   first existing of beings, being above superessentially. But you say,
   what in the world do we call the self-existent Being, or the
   self-existent Life, or whatever we lay down to be absolutely and
   originally and to have stood forth primarily from God? And we reply,
   this is not crooked but straight, and has a simple explanation. For we
   do not say that the self-existent Being, as Cause of the being of all
   things, is a sort of Divine or angelic essence (for the Superessential
   alone is Source and Essence and Cause of the existence of all things,
   and of the self-existent Being), nor that another Deity, besides the
   Super-divine, produces Life for all that live, and is a Life Causative
   of the self-existent Life; nor to speak summarily, that essences and
   personalities originate and make existing things, so that superficial
   people have named them both gods, and creators of existing
   things,--whom, to speak truly and properly, neither they themselves
   knew (for they are non-existent), nor their fathers,--but we call
   self-existent Being, and self-existent Life, and self-existent Deity,
   as regards at least Source, and Deity, and Cause, the One Superior and
   Superessential Source and Cause; but as regards Impartation, the
   providential Powers, that issue forth from God the unparticipating,
   (these we call) the self-existent essentiation, self-existent living,
   self-existent deification, by participating in which according to their
   own capacity, things existing, both are, and are said to be, existing,
   and living, and full of God--and the rest in the same way. Wherefore
   also, He is called the good Mainstay of the first of these, then of the
   whole of them, then of the portions of them, then of those who
   participate in them entirely, then of those who participate in them in
   part. And why must we speak of these things, since some of our divine
   instructors in holy things, affirm that the Super-good and Super-divine
   self-existent Goodness and Deity, is Mainstay even of the self-existent
   Goodness and Deity; affirming that the good-making and deifying gift
   issued forth from God; and that the self-existent beautifying stream,
   is self-existent beauty, and whole beauty, and partial beauty, and
   things absolutely beautiful, and things partially beautiful, and
   whatever other things are said and shall be said after the same
   fashion, which declare that providences and goodnesses issuing forth
   from God the unparticipating, in an ungrudging stream, are participated
   by existing things, and bubble over in order that distinctly the Cause
   of all may be beyond all, and the Superessential and Supernatural may,
   in every respect, be above things of any sort of essence and nature
   whatever.
     __________________________________________________________________

  CAPUT XII.

   Concerning Holy of Holies, King of Kings, Lord of Lords, God of Gods.

   SECTION I.

   BUT since whatever we have to say on these matters has reached, in my
   opinion, a fitting conclusion, we must sing Him of endless names, both
   as Holy of Holies and King of Kings; and as ruling eternity and for
   ever and beyond, and as Lord of Lords, and God of Gods. And first we
   must say, what we think Holiness Itself is; and what Kingdom, and what
   Lordship, and what Divinity, and what the Oracles wish to denote by the
   duplication of the names.

   SECTION II.

   Holiness then is (so far as we can say) the purity free from every
   pollution, and all perfect, and altogether unstained; Kingdom is the
   assignment of every limit and order, and ordinance and rank; and
   Lordship is not only the superiority over the worse, but also the
   perfect possession, in. every respect, of the Beautiful and Good; and a
   true and unswerving stability. Wherefore Lordship is parallel to to
   Kuros kai kurion, kai to kuriston [56] ; and Deity is the Providence
   watching over all, and with perfect goodness both circumscribing and
   grasping all, and filling with Itself, and surpassing all things which
   enjoy Its forethought.

   SECTION III.

   These things, then, must be sung absolutely, respecting the Cause
   surpassing all, and we must add that It surpasses Holiness, and
   Lordship, and Kingdom, and most simplex [57] Deity. For, from It,
   individually and collectively, were born and distributed every
   untarnished distinctness of every spotless purity, the whole
   arrangement and regulation of things existing, whilst It excludes want
   of harmony and want of equality, and want of symmetry, and rejoices
   over the well-ordered identity and rectitude, and leads round things,
   deemed worthy to participate in Itself. From It is all the perfect and
   complete possession of all. good things, every good forethought,
   watching and sustaining the objects of Its forethought, imparting
   Itself, as befits Its goodness, for deification of those who are turned
   to It.

   SECTION IV.

   But since the Cause of all is super-full of all, as beseems the One
   superfluity which surpasses all, He is sung as Holy of Holies and the
   rest, as beseems an overflowing Cause, and a towering Pre-eminence. As
   one might say, so far as the things which are,--holy or divine, or
   lordly, or kingly,--surpass the things which are not, and the
   self-existent participations, their participants; to such an extent is
   seated above all things that be, He Who is above all things that be,
   and the unparticipating Cause of all the participants and the
   participations. But Holy and Kings and Lords and Gods, the Oracles call
   the higher orders in each, through whom the inferior in participating
   the gifts from God, multiply the simplicity of their distribution
   around their own diversities, the variety of which, the superior orders
   carefully and divinely collect to their own Oneness.

  CAPUT XIII.

   Concerning "Perfect" and "One".

   SECTION I.

   So much then on these matters; but let us now at last, with your good
   pleasure, approach the most difficult subject in the whole discourse.
   For the Word of God predicates everything, singly and collectively,
   respecting the Cause of all, and extols Him both as Perfect and as One
   [58] . He is then perfect not only as self-perfect, and solitarily
   separated within Himself, by Himself, and throughout most perfect, but
   also as super-perfect, as beseems His pre-eminence over all, and
   limiting every infinitude, and surpassing every term, and by none
   contained or comprehended; but even extending at once to all, and above
   all, by His unfailing gratuities and endless energies. But, on the
   other hand, He is called perfect, both as without increase, and always
   perfect, and as undiminished, as pre-holding all things in Himself, and
   overflowing as beseems one, inexhaustible, and same, and super-full,
   and undiminished, abundance, in accordance with which He perfects all
   perfect things, and fills them with His own perfection.

   SECTION II.

   But One, because He is uniquely all, as beseems an excess of unique
   Oneness, and is Cause of all without departing from the One. For there
   is no single existing being, which does not participate in the one, but
   as every number participates in an unit, and one dual and one decade is
   spoken of, and one half, and one third and tenth, so everything, and
   part of everything participates in the one, and by the fact that the
   One is, all existing things are. And the Cause of all is not One, as
   one of many, but before every one and multitude, and determinative of
   every one and multitude. For there is no multitude which does not
   partake in some way or other of the one. Yea, that which is many by
   parts, is one in the whole; and the many by the accidents, is one by
   the subject; and the many by the number or the powers, is one by the
   species, and the many by the species, is one by the genus; and the many
   by the progressions, is one by the source. And there is no single thing
   which does not participate in some way in the one, which uniformly
   pre-held in the uniqueness throughout all, all and whole, all, even the
   things opposed. And indeed, without the one there will not be a
   multitude, but without the multitude there will be the one, even as the
   unit previous to every multiplied number; and, if any one should
   suppose, that all things are united to all, the All will be one in the
   whole.

   SECTION III.

   Especially must this be known, that according to the pre-conceived
   species of each one, things united are said to be made one, and the one
   is elemental of all; and if you should take away the one, there will be
   neither totality nor part, nor any other single existing thing. For the
   one, uniformly, pre-held and comprehended all things in itself. For
   this reason, then, the Word of God celebrates the whole Godhead, as
   Cause of all, by the epithet of the One, both one God the Father, and
   one Lord Jesus Christ, and one and the same Spirit, by reason of the
   surpassing indivisibility of the whole Divine Oneness, in which all
   things are uniquely collected, and are super-unified, and are with It
   Superessentially. Wherefore also, all things are justly referred and
   attributed to It, by Which and from Which, and through Which, and in
   Which, and to Which, all things are, and are co-ordinated, and abide,
   and are held together, and are filled, and are turned towards It. And
   you would not find any existing thing, which is not what it is, and
   perfected and preserved, by the One, after which the whole Deity is
   superessentially named. And it is necessary also, that we being turned
   from the many to the One, by the power of the Divine Oneness, should
   celebrate as One the whole and one Deity--the one Cause of all--which
   is before every one and multitude, and part and whole, and limit and
   illimitability, and term and infinity, which bounds all things that be,
   even the Being Itself, and is uniquely Cause of all, individually and
   collectively, and at the same time before all, and above all, and above
   the One existing Itself, and bounding the One existing Itself; since
   the One existing--that in things being--is numbered, and number
   participates in essence; but the superessential One bounds both the One
   existing, and every number, and Itself is, of both one and number, and
   every being, Source and Cause, and Number and. Order. Wherefore also,
   whilst celebrated as Unit and Triad, the Deity above all is neither
   Unit nor Triad, as understood by us or by any other sort of being, but,
   in order that we may celebrate truly. Its super-oneness, and Divine
   generation, by the threefold and single name of God, we name the Deity,
   Which is inexpressible to things that be, the Superessential. But no
   Unit nor Triad, nor number nor unity, nor productiveness, nor any other
   existing thing, or thing known to any existing thing, brings forth the
   hiddenness, above every expression and every mind, of the Super-Deity
   Which is above all superessentially. Nor has It a Name, or expression,
   but is elevated above in the inaccessible. And neither do we apply the
   very Name of Goodness, as making it adequate to It, but through a
   desire of understanding and saying something concerning that
   inexpressible nature, we consecrate the most august of Names to It, in
   the first degree, and although we should be in accord in this matter
   with the theologians, yet we shall fall short of the truth of the
   facts. Wherefore, even they have given the preference to the ascent
   through negations, as lifting the soul out of things kindred to itself,
   and conducting it through all the Divine conceptions, above which
   towers that which is above every name, and every expression and
   knowledge, and at the furthest extremity attaching it to Him, as far
   indeed as is possible for us to be attached to that Being.

   SECTION IV.

   We then, having collected these intelligible Divine Names, have
   unfolded them to the best of our ability, falling short not only of the
   precision which belongs to them, (for this truly, even Angels might
   say) nor only of their praises as sung by Angels (and the chief of our
   Theologians come behind the lowest of them), nor indeed of the
   Theologians themselves, nor of their followers or companions, but even
   of those who are of the same rank as ourselves, last and subordinate to
   them; so that, if the things spoken should be correct, and, if we, as
   far as in us lies, have really reached the perception of the unfolding
   of the Divine Names, let the fact be ascribed to the Author of all good
   things, Who, Himself, bestows first the power to speak, then to speak
   well. And if any one of the Names of the same force has been passed
   over, that also you must understand according to the same methods. But,
   if these things are either incorrect or imperfect, and we have wandered
   from the truth, either wholly or partially, may it be of thy brotherly
   kindness to correct him, who unwillingly is ignorant, and to impart a
   word to him, who wishes to learn, and to vouchsafe assistance to him,
   who has not power in himself; and to heal him, who, not willingly, is
   sick; and having found out some things from thyself, and others from
   others, and receiving all from the good to transfer them also to us. By
   no means grow weary in doing good to a man thy friend, for thou
   perceivest, that we also have kept to ourselves none of the
   hierarchical communications transmitted to us, but have transmitted
   them without flaw, both to you and to other holy men, yea, and will
   continue to transmit them, as we may be sufficient to speak, and those
   to whom we speak, to hear, doing injury in no respect to the tradition,
   if at least we do not fail in the conception and expression thereof.
   But, let these things be held and spoken in such way, as is well
   pleasing to Almighty God; and let this indeed be our conclusion to the
   intelligible Divine Names. But I will now pass to the Symbolic Theology
   [59] , with God for my Guide.

  NOTE.

    IGNATIUS.

   " MY love is crucified."

   Upon this passage I differ from all the commentators that I know. I
   believe the passage to have been written and inserted in the text by
   Dionysius when writing this letter, which must have been before A.D.
   98. I do not think it a quotation from the letter of Ignatius written
   just previous to his martyrdom. I think Dionysius quoted some previous
   writing of Ignatius, in which he spoke of our Saviour as "My Love,
   Which is mine." That is the sense in this passage, to shew the exalted
   use of Love. In the letter of Ignatius to the Romans, he seems to use
   "love" in the sense of human passion or fire, and says that that is
   crucified in him. In any case, there is no chronological difficulty.
   Ignatius was martyred A.D. 107, Dionysius, A.D. 119.

PREFACE TO MYSTIC THEOLOGY.

   MYSTIC THEOLOGY is like that ladder set up on the earth whose top
   reached to Heaven on which the angels of God were ascending and
   descending, and above which stood Almighty God. The Angel ascending is
   the "negative" which distinguishes Almighty God from all created
   things. God is not matter--soul, mind, spirit, any being, nor even
   being itself, but above and beyond all these. The Angel descending is
   the "Affirmative." God is good, wise, powerful, the Being, until we
   come to Symbolic Theology, which denotes Him under material forms and
   conditions: Theology prefers the negative because Almighty God is more
   appropriately presented by distinction than by comparison.
     __________________________________________________________________

  CAPUT I.

MYSTIC THEOLOGY.

   What is the Divine Gloom?

   SECTION I.

   TRIAD supernal, both super-God and super-good, Guardian of the
   Theosophy of Christian men, direct us aright to the super-unknown and
   super-brilliant and highest summit of the mystic Oracles, where the
   simple and absolute and changeless mysteries of theology lie hidden
   within the super-luminous gloom of the silence, revealing hidden
   things, which in its deepest darkness shines above the most
   super-brilliant, and in the altogether impalpable and invisible, fills
   to overflowing the eyeless minds with glories of surpassing beauty.
   This then be my prayer; but thou, O dear Timothy, by thy persistent
   commerce with the mystic visions, leave behind both sensible
   perceptions and intellectual efforts, and all objects of sense and
   intelligence, and all things not being and being, and be raised aloft
   unknowingly to the union, as far as attainable, with Him Who is above
   every essence and knowledge. For by the resistless and absolute ecstasy
   in all purity, from thyself and all, thou wilt be carried on high, to
   the superessential ray of the Divine darkness, when thou hast cast away
   all, and become free from all.

   SECTION II.

   But see that none of the uninitiated listen to these things--those I
   mean who are entangled in things being, and fancy there is nothing
   superessentially above things being, but imagine that they know, by
   their own knowledge, Him, Who has placed darkness as His hiding-place.
   But, if the Divine initiations are above such, what would any one say
   respecting those still more uninitiated, such as both portray the Cause
   exalted above all, from the lowest of things created, and say that It
   in no wise excels the no-gods fashioned by themselves and of manifold
   shapes, it being our duty both to attribute and affirm all the
   attributes of things existing to It, as Cause of all, and more properly
   to deny them all to It, as being above all, and not to consider the
   negations to be in opposition to the affirmations, but far rather that
   It, which is above every abstraction and definition, is above the
   privations.

   SECTION III.

   Thus, then, the divine Bartholomew says that Theology is much and
   least, and the Gospel broad and great, and on the other hand concise.
   He seems to me to have comprehended this supernaturally, that the good
   Cause of all is both of much utterance, and at the same time of
   briefest utterance and without utterance; as having neither utterance
   nor conception, because It is superessentially exalted above all, and
   manifested without veil and in truth, to those alone who pass through
   both all things consecrated and pure, and ascend above every ascent of
   all holy summits, and leave behind all divine lights and sounds, and
   heavenly words, and enter into the gloom, where really is, as the
   Oracles say, He Who is beyond all. For even the divine Moses is himself
   strictly bidden to be first purified, and then to be separated from
   those who are not so, and after entire cleansing hears the many-voiced
   trumpets, and sees many lights, shedding pure and streaming rays; then
   he is separated from the multitude, and with the chosen priests goes
   first to the summit of the divine ascents, although even then he does
   not meet with Almighty God Himself, but views not Him (for He is
   viewless) but the place where He is. Now this I think signifies that
   the most Divine and Highest of the things seen and contemplated are a
   sort of suggestive expression, of the things subject to Him Who is
   above all, through which His wholly inconceivable Presence is shown,
   reaching to the highest spiritual summits of His most holy places; and
   then he (Moses) is freed from them who are both seen and seeing, and
   enters into the gloom of the Agnosia; a gloom veritably mystic, within
   which he closes all perceptions of knowledge and enters into the
   altogether impalpable and unseen, being wholly of Him Who is beyond
   all, and of none, neither himself nor other; and by inactivity of all
   knowledge, united in his better part to. the altogether Unknown, and by
   knowing nothing, knowing above mind.
     __________________________________________________________________

  CAPUT II.

   How we ought both to be united and render praise to the Cause of all
   and above all.

   SECTION I.

   WE pray to enter within the super-bright gloom, and through not seeing
   and not knowing, to see and to know that the not to see nor to know is
   itself the above sight and knowledge. For this is veritably to see and
   to know and to celebrate super-essentially the Superessential, through
   the abstraction of all existing things, just as those who make a
   lifelike statue, by extracting all the encumbrances which have been
   placed upon the clear view of the concealed, and by bringing to light,
   by the mere cutting away [60] , the genuine beauty concealed in it.
   And, it is necessary, as I think, to celebrate the abstractions in an
   opposite way to the definitions. For, we used to place these latter by
   beginning from the foremost and descending through the middle to the
   lowest, but, in this case, by making the ascents from the lowest to the
   highest, we abstract everything, in order that, without veil, we may
   know that Agnosia, which is enshrouded under all the known, in all
   things that be, and may see that superessential gloom, which is hidden
   by all the light in existing things.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [60] i.e. the abstraction.
     __________________________________________________________________

  CAPUT III.

   What are the affirmative expressions respecting God, and what the
   negative.

   SECTION I.

   IN the Theological Outlines, then, we celebrated the principal
   affirmative expressions respecting God--how the Divine and good Nature
   is spoken of as One--how as Threefold--what is that within it which is
   spoken of as Paternity and Sonship--what the Divine name of "the Spirit
   "is meant to signify,--how from the immaterial and indivisible Good the
   Lights dwelling in the heart of Goodness sprang forth, and remained, in
   their branching forth, without departing from the coeternal abiding in
   Himself and in Themselves and in each other,--how the super-essential
   Jesus takes substance in veritable human nature--and whatever other
   things, made known by the Oracles, are celebrated throughout the
   Theological Outlines; and in the treatise concerning Divine Names, how
   He is named Good--how Being--how Life and Wisdom and Power--and
   whatever else belongs to the nomenclature of God. Further, in the
   Symbolical Theology, what are the Names transferred from objects of
   sense to things Divine?--what are the Divine forms?--what the Divine
   appearances, and parts and organs?--what the Divine places and
   ornaments?--what the angers?--what the griefs?--and the Divine
   wrath?--what the carousals, and the ensuing sicknesses?--what the
   oaths,--and what the curses?--what the sleepings, and what the
   awakings?--and all the other Divinely formed representations, which
   belong to the description of God, through symbols. And I imagine that
   you have comprehended, how the lowest are expressed in somewhat more
   words than the first. For, it was necessary that the Theological
   Outlines, and the unfolding of the Divine Names should be expressed in
   fewer words than the Symbolic Theology; since, in proportion as we
   ascend to the higher, in such a degree the expressions are
   circumscribed by the contemplations of the things intelligible. As even
   now, when entering into the gloom which is above mind, we shall find,
   not a little speaking, but a complete absence of speech, and absence of
   conception. In the other case, the discourse, in descending from the
   above to the lowest, is widened according to the descent, to a
   proportionate extent; but now, in ascending from below to that which is
   above, in proportion to the ascent, it is contracted, and after a
   complete ascent, it will become wholly voiceless, and will be wholly
   united to the unutterable. But, for what reason in short, you say,
   having attributed the Divine attributes from the foremost, do we begin
   the Divine abstraction from things lowest? Because it is necessary that
   they who place attributes on that which is above every attribute,
   should place the attributive affirmation from that which is more
   cognate to it; but that they who abstract, with regard to that which is
   above every abstraction, should make the abstraction from things which
   are further removed from it. Are not life and goodness more (cognate)
   than air and stone? and He is not given to debauch and to wrath, more
   (removed) than He is not expressed nor conceived.
     __________________________________________________________________

  CAPUT IV.

   That the pre-eminent Cause of every object of sensible perception is
   none of the objects of sensible perception.

   SECTION I.

   WE say then that the Cause of all, which is above all, is neither
   without being, nor without life--nor without reason, nor without mind,
   nor is a body--nor has shape--nor form--nor quality, or quantity, or
   bulk--nor is in a place--nor is seen--nor has sensible contact--nor
   perceives, nor is perceived, by the senses--nor has disorder and
   confusion, as being vexed by earthly passions,--nor is powerless, as
   being subject to casualties of sense,--nor is in need of
   light;--neither is It, nor has It, change, or decay, or division, or
   deprivation, or flux,--or any other of the objects of sense.
     __________________________________________________________________

  CAPUT V.

   That the pre-eminent Cause of every object of intelligible perception
   is none of the objects of intelligible perception.

   ON the other hand, ascending, we say, that It is neither soul, nor
   mind, nor has imagination, or opinion, or reason, or conception;
   neither is expressed, nor conceived; neither is number, nor order, nor
   greatness, nor littleness; nor equality, nor inequality; nor
   similarity, nor dissimilarity; neither is standing, nor moving; nor at
   rest; neither has power, nor is power, nor light; neither lives, nor is
   life; neither is essence nor eternity, nor time; neither is Its touch
   intelligible, neither is It science, nor truth; nor kingdom, nor
   wisdom; neither one, nor oneness; neither Deity, nor Goodness; nor is
   It Spirit according to our understanding; nor Sonship, nor Paternity;
   nor any other thing of those known to us, or to any other existing
   being; neither is It any of non-existing nor of existing things, nor do
   things existing know It, as It is; nor does It know existing things,
   qua existing; neither is there expression of It, nor name, nor
   knowledge; neither is It darkness, nor light; nor error, nor truth;
   neither is there any definition at all of It, nor any abstraction. But
   when making the predications and abstractions of things after It, we
   neither predicate, nor abstract from It; since the all-perfect and
   uniform Cause of all is both above every definition and the
   pre-eminence of Him, Who is absolutely freed from all, and beyond the
   whole, is also above every abstraction.

PREFACE TO THE LETTERS
OF DIONYSIUS THE
AREOPAGITE.

   THESE Letters attest the existence of the writings, and the wisdom
   spoken among the perfect, in the Apostolic Age.--To Gaius, who is
   commemorated by St. John and St. Paul, we owe the explanation of
   Agnosia, and valued teaching on the Personality of our Lord; to
   Dorotheus we are indebted for a fuller explanation of the Divine Gloom;
   to Sosipater, twice mentioned in the Acts and Romans, we owe the wisest
   letter ever penned for the instruction of the Christian Apologist and
   Missionary. The Letter to Polycarp touches on those mysterious signs in
   the heavens, by which Almighty God shewed His universal power.
   Dionysius shews his reverence for God's holy word, by never seeking to
   explain away, or to substitute what seems a less miracle for a greater.
   The trifold Mithra commemorated amongst the Babylonians shews that
   Hezekiah's sign was not merely visible and observed in Judea. The King,
   as High Priest of his people, was already robed for evening prayer,
   when he observed the sun gone back; and one day became almost three,
   i.e. thirty-two hours instead of thirty-six. Dionysius describes the
   darkness at the time of the Crucifixion, as it appeared in Egypt, and
   is recorded by Phlegon. We do not explain and interpret the facts
   recorded in the Gospel, by denying them, or by treating the same
   testimony outside the Gospel as superstitious.

   To Demophilus, we owe a knowledge of Church-law and order, which
   teaches the Christian duty of being "sent," and which should teach
   clergy to obey their Bishop, and not merely the Act of uniformity. To
   Titus, we owe the preservation of the sum of the Symbolic Theology.
   From the letter to St. John in Patmos, we learn the love between St.
   John arid Dionysius, and that St. John was then Called the "Sun of the
   Gospel." From the letter to Apollophanes, we know that the prayers of
   Dionysius for the conversion of his friend did not fall to the ground.
   Apollophanes was tutor to Polemon, who again was tutor to Aristides,
   who presented his "Apology" to the Emperor Hadrian. The conversion of
   Statonice, the wife of Apollophanes, was the cause of St. Paul's being
   cast into chains at Philippi, where the messengers from Corinth found
   him, through whom he sent the Epistle recently brought to light [61] .

LETTERS OF DIONYSIUS THE AREOPAGITE.

   LETTER I. To Gaius Therapeutes.

   DARKNESS becomes invisible by light, and specially by much light.
   Varied knowledge (ai gnoseis), and especially much varied knowledge,
   makes the Agnosia [62] to vanish. Take this in a superlative, but not
   in a defective sense, and reply with superlative truth, that the
   Agnosia, respecting God, escapes those who possess existing light, and
   knowledge of things being; and His pre-eminent darkness is both
   concealed by every light, and is hidden from every knowledge. And, if
   any one, having seen God, understood what he saw, he did not see Him,
   but some of His creatures that are existing and known. But He Himself,
   highly established above mind, and above essence, by the very fact of
   His being wholly unknown, and not being, both is super-essentially, and
   is known above mind. And the all-perfect Agnosia, in its superior
   sense, is a knowledge of Him, Who is above all known things.

   LETTER II. To the same Gaius Therapeutes.

   How is He, Who is beyond all [63] , both above source of Divinity and
   above source of Good? Provided you understand Deity and Goodness, as
   the very Actuality of the Good-making and God-making gift, and the
   inimitable imitation of the super-divine and super-good (gift), by aid
   of which we are deified and made good. For, moreover, if this becomes
   source of the deification and making good of those who are being
   deified and made good, He,--Who is super-source of every source, even
   of the so-called Deity and Goodness, seeing He is beyond source of
   Divinity and source of Goodness, in so far as He is inimitable, and not
   to be retained--excels the imitations and retentions, and the things
   which are imitated and those participating.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [63] C. II. § 6.
     __________________________________________________________________

   LETTER III. To the same Gaius.

   "Sudden" is that which, contrary to expectation, and out of the, as
   yet, unmanifest, is brought into the manifest. But with regard to
   Christ's love of man, I think that the Word of God suggests even this,
   that the Superessential proceeded forth out of the hidden, into the
   manifestation amongst us, by having taken substance as man. But, He is
   hidden, even after the manifestation, or to speak more divinely, even
   in the manifestation, for in truth this of Jesus has been kept hidden,
   and the mystery with respect to Him has been reached by no word nor
   mind, but even when spoken, remains unsaid, and when conceived unknown.
     __________________________________________________________________

   LETTER IV. [64] To the same Gaius Therapeutes.

   How, you ask, is Jesus, Who is beyond all, ranked essentially with all
   men? For, not as Author of men is He here called man, but as being in
   absolute whole essence truly man. But we do not define the Lord Jesus,
   humanly, for He is not man only, (neither superessential nor man only),
   but truly man, He Who is pre-eminently a lover of man, the
   Super-essential, taking substance, above men and after men, from the
   substance of men. And it is nothing less, the ever Superessential,
   super-full of super-essentiality, disregards the excess [65] of this,
   and having come truly into substance, took substance above substance,
   and above man works things of man. And a virgin supernaturally
   conceiving, and unstable water, holding up weight of material and
   earthly feet, and not giving way, but, by a supernatural power standing
   together so as not to be divided, demonstrate this. Why should any one
   go through the rest, which are very many? Through which, he who looks
   with a divine vision, will know beyond mind, even the things affirmed
   respecting the love towards man, of (the Lord) Jesus,--things which
   possess a force of superlative negation. For, even, to speak summarily,
   He was not man, not as not being man, but as being from men was beyond
   men, and was above man, having truly been born man, and for the rest,
   not having done things Divine as God, nor things human as man, but
   exercising for us a certain new God-incarnate energy of God having
   become man.

   LETTER V. To Dorotheus, Leitourgos.

   The Divine gloom is the unapproachable light in which God is said to
   dwell [66] . And in this gloom, invisible [67] indeed, on account of
   the surpassing brightness, and unapproachable on account of the excess
   of the superessential stream of light, enters every one deemed worthy
   to know and to see God, by the very fact of neither seeing nor knowing,
   really entering in Him, Who is above vision and knowledge, knowing this
   very thing, that He is after all the object of sensible and intelligent
   perception, and saying in the words of the Prophet, "Thy knowledge was
   regarded as wonderful by me; It was confirmed; I can by no means attain
   unto it [68] ;" even as the Divine Paul is said to have known Almighty
   God, by having known Him as being above all conception and knowledge.
   Wherefore also, he says, "His ways are past finding out [69] and His
   Judgements inscrutable," and His gifts "indescribable [70] ," and that
   His peace surpasses every mind [71] , as having found Him Who is above
   all, and having known this which is above conception, that, by being
   Cause of all, He is beyond all.

   LETTER VI. To Sopatros [72] --Priest.

   Do not imagine this a victory, holy Sopatros, to have denounced [73] a
   devotion, or an opinion, which apparently is not good. For
   neither--even if you should have convicted it accurately--are the
   (teachings) of Sopatros consequently good. For it is possible, both
   that you and others, whilst occupied in many things that are false and
   apparent, should overlook the true, which is One and hidden. For
   neither, if anything is not red, is it therefore white, nor if
   something is not a horse, is it necessarily a man. But thus will you
   do, if you follow my advice, you will cease indeed to speak against
   others, but will so speak on behalf of truth, that every thing said is
   altogether unquestionable.

   LETTER VII.

   SECTION I. To Polycarp--Hierarch.

   I, at any rate, am not conscious, when speaking in reply to Greeks or
   others, of fancying to assist good men, in case they should be able to
   know and speak the very truth, as it really is in itself. For, when
   this is correctly demonstrated in its essential nature, according to a
   law of truth, and has been established without flaw, every thing which
   is otherwise, and simulates the truth, will be convicted of being other
   than the reality, and dissimilar, and that which is seeming rather than
   real. It is superfluous then, that the expounder of truth should
   contend with these or those [74] . For each affirms himself to have the
   royal coin, and perchance has some deceptive image of a certain portion
   of the true. And, if you refute this, first the one, and then the
   other, will contend concerning the same. But, when the true statement
   itself has been correctly laid down, and has remained unrefuted by all
   the rest, every thing which is not so in every respect is cast down of
   itself, by the impregnable stability of the really true. Having then as
   I think well understood this, I have not been over zealous to speak in
   reply to Greeks or to others; but it is sufficient for me (and may God
   grant this), first to know about truth, then, having known, to speak as
   it is fitting to speak.

   SECTION II.

   But you say, the Sophist Apollophanes rails at me, and calls me
   parricide, as using, not piously, the writings of Greeks against the
   Greeks. Yet, in reply to him, it were more true for us to say, that
   Greeks use, not piously, things Divine against things Divine,
   attempting through the wisdom of Almighty God to eject the Divine
   Worship. And I am not speaking of the opinion of the multitude, who
   cling tenaciously to the writings of the poets, with earthly and
   impassioned proclivities, and Worship the creature [75] rather than the
   Creator; but even Apollophanes himself uses not piously things Divine
   against things Divine; for by the knowledge of things created, well
   called Philosophy by him, and by the divine Paul named Wisdom of God,
   the true philosophers ought to have been elevated to the Cause of
   things created and of the knowledge of them. And in order that he may
   not improperly impute to me the opinion of others, or that of himself,
   Apollophanes, being a wise man, ought to recognise that nothing could
   otherwise be removed from its heavenly course and movement, if it had
   not the Sustainer and Cause of its being moving it thereto, who forms
   all things, and "transforms them [76] " according to the sacred text.
   How then does he not worship Him, known to us even from this, and
   verily being God of the whole, admiring Him for His all causative and
   super-inexpressible power, when sun [77] and moon, together with the
   universe, by a power and stability most supernatural, were fixed by
   them to entire immobility, and, for a measure of a whole day, all the
   constellations stood in the same places; or (which is greater than even
   this), if when the whole and the greater and embracing were thus
   carried along, those embraced did not follow in their course; and when
   a certain other day [78] was almost tripled in duration, even in twenty
   whole hours [79] , either the universe retraced contrary routes for so
   long a time, and (was) turned back by the thus very most supernatural
   backward revolutions; or the sun, in its own course, having contracted
   its five-fold motion in ten hours, retrogressively again retraced it in
   the other ten hours, by traversing a sort of new route. This thing
   indeed naturally astounded even Babylonians [80] , and, without battle,
   brought them into subjection to Hezekiah, as though he were a somebody
   equal to God, and superior to ordinary men. And, by no means do I
   allege the great works in Egypt [81] , or certain other Divine
   portents, which took place elsewhere, but the well-known and celestial
   ones, which were renowned in every place and by all persons. But
   Apollophanes is ever saying that these things are not true. At any rate
   then, this is reported by the Persian sacerdotal legends, and to this
   day, Magi celebrate the memorials of the threefold Mithrus [82] . But
   let him disbelieve these things, by reason of his ignorance or his
   inexperience. Say to him, however, "What do you affirm concerning the
   eclipse, which took place at the time of the saving Cross [83] ?" For
   both of us at that time, at Heliopolis, being present, and standing
   together, saw the moon approaching the sun, to our surprise (for it was
   not appointed time for conjunction); and again, from the ninth hour to
   the evening, supernaturally placed back again into a line opposite the
   sun. And remind him also of something further. For he knows that we
   saw, to our surprise, the contact itself beginning from the east, and
   going towards the edge of the sun's disc, then receding back, and
   again, both the contact and the re-clearing [84] , not taking place
   from the same point, but from that diametrically opposite. So great are
   the supernatural things of that appointed time, and possible to Christ
   alone, the Cause of all, Who worketh great things and marvellous, of
   which there is not number.

   SECTION III.

   These things say, if occasion serves, and if possible, O Apollophanes,
   refute them, and to me, who was then both present with thee, and saw
   and judged and wondered with thee at them all. And in truth
   Apollophanes begins prophesying at that time, I know not whence, and to
   me he said, as if conjecturing the things taking place, "these things,
   O excellent Dionysius, are requitals of Divine deeds." Let so much be
   said by us by letter; but you are capable, both to supply the
   deficiency, and to bring eventually to God that distinguished man, who
   is wise in many things, and who perhaps will not disdain to meekly
   learn the truth, which is above wisdom, of our religion.

   [79] The "twenty hours" which made one day almost equal to three are

   degrees = ten hours. The Sun had then run already a course of ten
   hours, from 6 A.M. to 4 P.M. In returning there were ten hours more,
   and in retracing the route ten hours more, which together make thirty
   hours. The two hours, to complete the day of twelve hours, make
   thirty-two hours. The thirty-two hours are four hours less than
   thirty-six, the time of three days of twelve hours each. One day was
   thus nearly equal to three. Whatever we may think the facts, the
   Babylonians commemorated the threefold Mythra --the Sun--in

   LETTER VIII. To Demophilus, Therapeutes. About minding ones own
   business, and kindness.

   SECTION I.

   The histories of the Hebrews say, O noble Demophilus, that, even that
   holy, distinguished Moses was deemed worthy of the Divine manifestation
   on account of his great meekness [85] . And, if at any time they
   describe him as being excluded from the vision [86] of God, they do not
   cast him out from God for his meekness. But they say that when speaking
   very rashly, and opposing the Divine Counsels, Jehovah was angry with
   him with wrath. But when they make him proclaimed by his God-discerned
   deserts, he is proclaimed, from his pre-eminent imitation of the Good.
   For he was very meek, and on this account is called "Servant of God,"
   and deemed more fit for vision of God than all Prophets. Now, when
   certain envious [87] people were contending with him and Aaron, about
   the High Priesthood and government of the tribes, he was superior to
   all love of honour, and love of rule, and referred the presidency over
   the people to the Divine judgment. And, when they even rose up against
   him, and reproaching him concerning the precedency, were threatening
   him, and were already almost upon him, the meek man invoked the Good
   for preservation, but very suitably asserted that he would be guiltless
   of all evils to the governed. For he knew that it is necessary, that
   the familiar with God the Good should be moulded, as far as is
   attainable, to that which is specially most like the Good, and should
   be conscious within himself of the performance of deeds of good
   friendship. And what made David [88] , the father of God, a friend of
   God? Even for being good and generous towards enemies [89] . The
   Super-Good, and the Friend of Good says--"I have found a man after mine
   own heart." Further also, a generous injunction was given, to care for
   even one's enemy's beasts of burden [90] . And Job [91] was pronounced
   just, as being free from injury. And Joseph [92] did not take revenge
   upon the brethren who had plotted against him; and Abel, at once, and
   without suspicion, accompanied the fratricide. And the Word of God
   proclaims all the good as not devising evil things [93] , not doing
   them [94] , but neither being changed from the good, by the baseness of
   others [95] , but, on the contrary, after the example of God [96] , as
   doing good to, and throwing their shield over the evil; and generously
   calling them to their own abundant goodness, and to their own
   similitude. But let us ascend higher, not proclaiming the gentleness of
   holy men, nor kindness of philanthropic angels, who take compassion
   upon nations, and invoke good [97] on their behalf, and punish the
   destructive and devastating mobs, and, whilst being grieved over
   calamities, yet rejoice over the safety of those who are being called
   back to things good [98] ; nor whatever else the Word of God teaches
   concerning the beneficent angels [99] ; but, whilst in silence
   welcoming the beneficent rays of the really good and super-good Christ,
   by them let us be lighted on our path, to His Divine works of Goodness.
   For assuredly is it not of a Goodness inexpressible and beyond
   conception, that He makes all things existing to be, and brought all
   things themselves to being, and wishes all things ever to become near
   to Himself, and participants of Himself, according to the aptitude of
   each? And why? Because He clings lovingly to those who even depart from
   Him, and strives [100] and beseeches not to be disowned by those
   beloved who are themselves coy; and He bears with those who heedlessly
   reproach Him [101] , and Himself makes excuse for them, and further
   promises to serve them, and runs towards and meets [102] even those who
   hold themselves aloof, immediately that they approach; and when His
   entire self has embraced their entire selves, He kisses them, and does
   not reproach them for former things, but rejoices over the present, and
   holds a feast, and calls together the friends, that is to say, the
   good, in order that the household may be altogether rejoicing. (But,
   Demophilus, of all persons in the world, is at enmity with, and very
   justly rebukes, and teaches beautiful things to, good men, and
   rejoices.) "For how," He says, "ought not the good to rejoice over
   safety of the lost, and over life of those who are dead." And, as a
   matter of course, He raises upon His shoulders that which with
   difficulty has been turned from error, and summons the good angels to
   rejoicing, and is generous to the unthankful, and makes His sun to rise
   upon evil and good, and presents His very soul [103] as an offering on
   behalf of those who are fleeing from Him.

   But thou, as thy letters testify, I do not know how, being in thy
   senses, hast spurned one fallen down before the priest, who, as thou
   sayest, was unholy and a sinner. Then this one entreated and confessed
   that he has come for healing of evil deeds, but thou didst not shiver,
   but even insolently didst cover with abuse the good priest, for shewing
   compassion to a penitent, and justifying the unholy. And at last, thou
   saidst to the priest, "Go out with thy like"; and didst burst, contrary
   to permission, into the sanctuary, and defiledst the Holy of holies,
   and writest to us, that "I have providentially preserved the things
   sacred, which were about to be profaned, and am still keeping them
   undefiled."

   Now, then, hear our view. It is not lawful that a priest should be
   corrected by the Leitourgoi, who are above thee, or by the Therapeutae,
   who are of the same rank with thee; even though he should seem to act
   irreverently towards things Divine, and though he should be convicted
   of having done some other thing forbidden. For, if want of order, and
   want of regulation, is a departure from the most Divine institutions
   and decrees, it is not reasonable that the divinely transmitted order
   should be changed on God's behalf. For Almighty God is not divided
   against Himself, for, "how then shall His kingdom stand [104] ?" And if
   the judgment is of God, as the Oracles affirm [105] , and the priests
   are angels and interpreters, after the hierarchs, of the Divine
   judgments, learn from them through whom thou wast deemed worthy to be a
   Therapeutes, through the intermediate Leitourgoi, when opportunity
   serves, the things Divine suitable for thyself [106] . And do not the
   Divine Symbols proclaim this, for is not the Holy of holies altogether
   simply separated from all, and the order of the consecrators is in
   closer proximity to it than the rank of the priests, and following
   these, that of the Leitourgoi. But the gates of the sanctuary are
   bounded by the appointed Therapeutae, within which they are both
   ordained, and around which they stand, not to guard them, but for
   order, and teaching of themselves that they are nearer the people than
   the priesthood. Whence the holy regulation of the priests orders them
   to participate in things Divine, enjoining the impartation of these to
   others, that is to say, the more inward. For even those who always
   stand around the Divine Altar, for a symbolical purpose, see and hear
   things Divine revealed to themselves in all clearness; and advancing
   generously to things outside the Divine Veils, they shew, to the
   subject Therapeutae, and to the holy people, and to the orders under
   purification, according to their meetness, things holy which had been
   beautifully guarded without pollution, until thou didst tyrannically
   burst into them, and compelledst the Holy of holies, against its will,
   to be strutted over by thee, and thou sayest, that thou holdest and
   guardest the sacred things, although thou neither hast known, nor
   heard, nor possessest any of the things belonging to the priests; as
   neither hast thou known the truth of the Oracles, whilst cavilling
   about them each day to subversion of the hearers. And even if same
   civil Governor undertook what was not commanded him by a King, justly
   would any one of the subordinates standing by be punished who dared to
   criticise the Governor, when justifying, or condemning any one; (for I
   do not go so far as to say to vituperate), and at the same time thought
   to cast him from his government; but thou, man, art thus rash in what
   concerns the affairs of the meek and good, and his hierarchical
   jurisdiction. We are bound to say these things, when any one undertakes
   what is above his rank, and at the same time thinks that he acts
   properly. For this is not within the powers of any one. For what was
   Ozias [107] doing out of place, when offering incense to Almighty God?
   and what Saul [108] in sacrificing?

   Yea, further, what were those domineering demons [109] , who were truly
   proclaiming the Lord Jesus God? But every one who meddles with other
   people's business, is outlawed by the Word of God; and each one shall
   be in the rank of his own service, and alone the High Priest [110]
   shall enter into the Holy of holies, and once only throughout the year
   [111] , and this in the full legal hierarchical purification [112] .
   And the priests [113] encompass the holy things, and the Levites must
   not touch the holy things, lest they die. And Jehovah was angry with
   wrath at the rashness of Ozias, and Mariam [114] becomes leprous,
   because she had presumed to lay down laws for the lawgiver. And the
   demons fastened on the sons of Sceva, and He says, "I did not send
   them, yet they ran, and I spake not to them yet they prophesied [115]
   ." "And the profane [116] who sacrifices to me a calf, (is) as he who
   slays a dog," and to speak briefly, the all-perfect justice of Almighty
   God does not tolerate the disregarders of law, but whilst they are
   saying "in Thy [117] Name, we ourselves did many wonderful works," He
   retorts, "And I know you not; go from Me all ye workers of
   lawlessness." So that it is not permissible, as the holy Oracles say,
   even to pursue things that are just, when not according to order [118]
   , but each must keep to himself [119] , and not meditate things too
   high and too deep for him [120] , but contemplate alone things
   prescribed for him according to order.

   SECTION II.

   " What then," thou sayest, "is it not necessary to correct the priests
   who are acting irreverently, or convicted of something else out of
   place, but to those only, who glory in law, shall it be permitted to
   dishonour Almighty God [121] , through the transgression of the Law?
   "And how are the priests interpreters [122] of Almighty God? For, how
   do they announce to the people the Divine virtues, who do not know the
   power of them? or how do they, who are in darkness [123] , communicate
   light? Further, how do they impart the Divine Spirit, who, by habit and
   truth do not believe whether there is a Holy Spirit [124] ? Now I will
   give thee an answer to these things. For truly my Demophilus is not an
   enemy, nor will I tolerate that thou shouldst be overreached by Satan.

   For each rank of those about God, is more godlike than that which
   stands further away. And those which are somewhat nearer to the true
   light, are at once more luminous, and more illuminating; and do not
   understand the nearness topically, but according to God-receptive
   aptitude. If, then, the order of the priests is the illuminating,
   entirely has he fallen from the priestly rank and power, who does not
   illuminate, or perhaps rather (he becomes) the unilluminated. And he
   seems, to me at least, rash who, being such, undertakes the priestly
   functions, and has no fear, and does not blush, when performing things
   Divine, contrary to propriety, and fancying that God does not know the
   very things of which he is conscious in himself, and thinks to mislead
   Him Who is falsely called by him Father, and presumes to repeat his
   cursed blasphemies (for I would not say prayers) over the Divine
   symbols, after the example of Christ. This one is not a
   priest,--No!--but devilish--crafty --a deceiver of himself--and a wolf
   to the people of God, clothed in sheep's clothing.

   SECTION III.

   But, it is not to Demophilus that it is permitted to put these things
   straight. For, if the Word of God commands to pursue just things justly
   [125] (but to pursue just things is, when any one wishes to distribute
   to each one things that are meet), this must be pursued by all justly,
   not beyond their own meetness or rank [126] ; since even to angels it
   is just that things meet be assigned and apportioned, but not from us,
   O Demophilus, but through them to us, of God, and to them through the
   angels who are still more pre-eminent. And to speak shortly, amongst
   all existing things their due is assigned through the first to the
   second, by the well-ordered and most just forethought of all. Let
   those, then, who have been ordered by God to superintend others,
   distribute after themselves their due to their inferiors. But, let
   Demophilus apportion their due to reason and anger and passion; and let
   him not maltreat the regulation of himself, but let the superior reason
   bear rule over things inferior. For, if one were to see, in the
   market-place, a servant abusing a master, and a younger man, an elder;
   or also a son, a father; and in addition attacking and inflicting
   wounds, we should seem even to fail in reverence if we did not run and
   succour the superior, even though perhaps they were first guilty of
   injustice; how then shall we not blush, when we see reason maltreated
   by anger and passion, and cast out of the sovereignty given by God; and
   when we raise in our own selves an irreverent and unjust disorder, and
   insurrection and confusion? Naturally, our blessed Law-giver from God
   does not deem right that one should preside over the Church of God, who
   has not already well presided over his own house [127] . For, he who
   has governed himself will also govern another; and who, another, will
   also govern a house; and who, a house, also a city; and who, a city,
   also a nation. And to speak briefly as the Oracles affirm, "he who is
   faithful in little, is faithful also in much," and "he who is
   unfaithful in little, is unfaithful also in much."

   SECTION IV.

   Thyself, then, assign their due limit to passion and anger and reason.
   And to thyself, let the divine Leitourgoi assign the due limit, and to
   these, the priests, and to the priests, hierarchs, and to the
   hierarchs, the Apostles and the successors of the Apostles. And if,
   perchance, any, even among these, should have failed in what is
   becoming, he shall be put right by the holy men of the same rank; and
   rank shall not be turned against rank, but each shall be in his own
   rank, and in his own service. So much for thee, from us, on behalf of
   knowing and doing one's own business. But, concerning the inhuman
   treatment towards that man, whom thou callest "irreverent and sinner,"
   I know not how I shall bewail the scandal of my beloved. For, of whom
   dost thou suppose thou wast ordained Therapeutes by us? For if it were
   not of the Good, it is necessary that thou shouldst be altogether alien
   from Him and from us, and from our whole religion, and it is time for
   thee both to seek a God, and other priests, and amongst them to become
   brutal rather than perfected, and to be a cruel minister of thine own
   fierceness. For, have we ourselves, forsooth, been perfected to the
   altogether Good, and have no need of the divine compassion for
   ourselves [128] , or do we commit the double sin [129] , as the Oracles
   say, after the example of the unholy, not knowing in what we offend,
   but even justifying ourselves and supposing we see, whilst really not
   seeing [130] ? Heaven was startled at this, and I shivered, and I
   distrust myself. And unless I had met with thy letters (as know well I
   would I had not), they would not have persuaded me if indeed any other
   had thought good to persuade me concerning thee, that Demophilus
   supposes, that Almighty God, Who is good to all, is not also
   compassionate towards men, and that he himself has no need of the
   Merciful or the Saviour; yea further, he deposes those priests who are
   deemed worthy, through clemency, to bear the ignorances of the people,
   and who well know, that they also are compassed with infirmity. But,
   the supremely Divine Priest pursued a different (course), and that as
   the Oracles say, from being separate of sinners, and makes the most
   gentle tending of the sheep a proof of the love towards Himself; and He
   stigmatizes as wicked, him who did not forgive his fellow-servant the
   debt, nor impart a portion of that manifold goodness, graciously given
   to himself; and He condemns him to enjoy his own deserts, which both
   myself and Demophilus must take care to avoid. For, even for those who
   were treating Him impiously, at the very time of His suffering, He
   invokes remission from the Father; and He rebukes even the disciples,
   because without mercy they thought it right to convict of impiety the
   Samaritans who drove Him away. This, indeed, is the thousand times
   repeated theme of thy impudent letter (for thou repeatest the same from
   beginning to end), that thou hast avenged, not thyself, but Almighty
   God. Tell me (dost thou avenge) the Good by means of evil?

   SECTION V.

   Avaunt! We have not a High Priest, "Who cannot be touched with our
   infirmities, but is both without sin and merciful." "He shall not
   strive nor cry, and is Himself meek, and Himself propitiatory for our
   sins; so that we will not approve your unenviable attacks, not if you
   should allege a thousand times your Phineas and your Elias. For, when
   the Lord Jesus heard these things, He was displeased with the
   disciples, who at that time lacked the meek and good spirit. For, even
   our most divine preceptor teaches in meekness those who opposed
   themselves to the teaching of Almighty God. For, we must teach, not
   avenge ourselves upon, the ignorant, as we do not punish the blind, but
   rather lead them by the hand. But thou, after striking him on the
   cheek, rustiest upon that man, who is beginning to rise to the truth,
   and when he is approaching with much modesty, thou insolently kickest
   him away (certainly, this is enough to make one shudder), whom the Lord
   Christ, as being good, seeks, when wandering upon the mountains, and
   calls to Him, when fleeing from Him, and when, with difficulty, found,
   places upon His shoulders. Do not, I pray, do not let us thus
   injuriously counsel for ourselves, nor drive the sword against
   ourselves. For they, who undertake to injure any one, or on the
   contrary to do them good, do not always effect what they wish, but for
   themselves, when they have brought into their house vice or virtue,
   will be filled either with Divine virtues, or ungovernable passions.
   And these indeed, as followers and companions of good angels, both here
   and there, with all peace and freedom from all evil, will inherit the
   most blessed inheritances for the ever-continuing age, and will be ever
   with God, the greatest of all blessings; but, the other will fall both
   from the divine and their own peace, and here, and after death, will be
   companions with cruel demons. For which reason, we have an earnest
   desire to become companions of God, the Good, and to be ever with the
   Lord, and not to be separated, along with the evil, from the most Just
   One, whilst undergoing that which is due from ourselves, which I fear
   most of all, and pray to have no share in anything evil. And, with your
   permission, I will mention a divine vision of a certain holy man, and
   do not laugh, for I am speaking true.

   SECTION VI.

   When I was once in Crete, the holy Carpus [131] entertained me,--a man,
   of all others, most fitted, on account of great purity of mind, for
   Divine Vision. Now, he never undertook the holy celebrations of the
   Mysteries, unless a propitious vision were first manifested to him
   during his preparatory devout prayers. He said then, when some one of
   the unbelievers had at one time grieved him (and his grief was, that he
   had led astray to ungodliness a certain member of the Church, whilst
   the days of rejoicing were still being celebrated for him); that he
   ought compassionately to have prayed on behalf of both, and taking God,
   the Saviour, as his fellow-helper, to convert the one, and to overcome
   the other by goodness [132] , and not to have ceased warning them so
   long as he lived until this day; and thus to lead them to the knowledge
   of God, so that the things disputed by them might be clearly
   determined, and those, who were irrationally bold, might be compelled
   to be wiser by a judgment according to law. Now, as he had never before
   experienced this, I do not know how he then went to bed with such a
   surfeit of ill-will and bitterness. In this evil condition he went to
   sleep, for it was evening, and at midnight (for he was accustomed at
   that appointed hour to rise, of his own accord, for the Divine
   melodies) he arose, not having enjoyed, undisturbed, his slumbers,
   which were many and continually broken; and, when he stood collected
   for the, Divine Converse, he was guiltily vexed and displeased, saying,
   that it was not just that godless men, who pervert the straight ways of
   the Lord, should live. And, whilst saying this, he besought Almighty
   God, by some stroke of lightning, suddenly, without mercy, to cut short
   the lives of them both. But, whilst saying this, he declared, that he
   seemed to see suddenly the house in which he stood, first torn asunder,
   and from the roof divided into two in the midst, and a sort of gleaming
   fire before his eyes (for the place seemed now under the open sky)
   borne down from the heavenly region close to him; and, the heaven
   itself giving way, and upon the back of the heaven, Jesus, with
   innumerable angels, in the form of men, standing around Him. This
   indeed, he saw, above, and himself marvelled; but below, when Carpus
   had bent down, he affirmed that he saw the very foundation ripped in
   two, to a sort of yawning and dark chasm, and those very men, upon whom
   he had invoked a curse, standing before his eyes, within the mouth of
   the chasm, trembling, pitiful, only just not yet carried down by the
   mere slipping of their feet; and from below the chasm, serpents,
   creeping up and gliding from underneath, around their feet, now
   contriving to drag them away, and weighing them down, and lifting them
   up, and again inflaming or irritating with their teeth or their tails,
   and all the time endeavouring to pull them down into the yawning gulf;
   and that certain men also were in the midst, co-operating with the
   serpents against these men, at once tearing and pushing and beating
   them down. And they seemed to be on the point of falling, partly
   against their will, partly by their will; almost overcome by the
   calamity, and at the same time resigned. And Carpus said, that he
   himself was glad, whilst looking below, and that he was forgetful of
   the things above; further, that he was vexed and made light of it,
   because they had not already fallen, and that he often attempted to
   accomplish the fact, and that, when he did not succeed, he was both
   irritated and cursed. And, when with difficulty he raised himself, he
   saw the heaven again, as he saw it before, and Jesus, moved with pity
   at what was taking place, standing up from His supercelestial throne,
   and descending to them, and stretching a helping hand, and the angels,
   co-operating with Him, taking hold of the two men, one from one place
   and another from, another, and the Lord Jesus said to Carpus, whilst
   His hand was yet extended, "Strike against Me in future, for I am
   ready, even again, to suffer for the salvation of men; and this is
   pleasing to Me, provided that other men do not commit sin. But see,
   whether it is well for thee to exchange the dwelling in the chasm, and
   with serpents, for that with God, and the good and philanthropic
   angels." These are the things which I heard myself, and believe to be
   true.

   TITUS.

   ZENAS, one of the seventy-two disciples, who was versed in the science
   of law, wrote a life of Titus, and says that he was descended from the
   family of Minos, King of Crete. Titus gave himself to the study of
   Homer and Philosophy till his twentieth year, when he heard a voice
   from heaven, which told him to quit this place and save his soul. He
   waited one year, to test the truth of the voice, and then had a
   revelation which bade him read the Hebrew Scriptures. Opening Isaiah,
   his eye fell on chapter xli. vv 1-5. He was then sent to Jerusalem by
   the pro-consul of Crete to report upon the reality of the miracles said
   to be performed by Jesus Christ. He saw our Saviour, and His miracles,
   and believed; and became one of the seventy-two. He witnessed the
   Passion and Ascension; the Apostles consecrated him, and sent him with
   Paul, whom he attended to Antioch, to Seleucia and to Crete, where
   Rutilus, pro-consul, was baptized, and Titus appointed Bishop. In A.D.
   64, St. Paul addressed his Epistle to Titus, and about the same time
   Dionysius also, this letter. Dexter records that Titus visited Spain,
   and that Pliny, the younger, was converted to the Faith by Titus. He
   consecrated the second Bishop of Alexandria, and died at the age of 94.

   LETTER IX. To Titus, Hierarch, asking by letter what is the house of
   wisdom, what the bowl, and what are its meats and drinks?

   SECTION I.

   I do not know, O excellent Titus, whether the holy Timothy departed,
   deaf to some of the theological symbols which were explained by me.
   But, in the Symbolic Theology, we have thoroughly investigated for him
   all the expressions of the Oracles concerning God, which appear to the
   multitude to be monstrous. For they give a colour of incongruity
   dreadful to the uninitiated souls, when the Fathers of the unutterable
   wisdom explain the Divine and Mystical Truth, unapproachable by the
   profane, through certain, certainly hidden and daring enigmas.
   Wherefore also, the many discredit the expressions concerning the
   Divine Mysteries. For, we contemplate them only through the sensible
   symbols that have grown upon them. We must then strip them, and view
   them by themselves in their naked purity. For, thus contemplating them,
   we should reverence a fountain of Life flowing into Itself--viewing It
   even standing by Itself, and as a kind of single power, simple,
   self-moved, and self-worked, not abandoning Itself, but a knowledge
   surpassing every kind of knowledge, and always contemplating Itself,
   through Itself. We thought it necessary then, both for him and for
   others, that we should, as far as possible, unfold the varied forms of
   the Divine" representations of God in symbols. For, with what
   incredible and simulated monstrosities are its external, forms filled?
   For instance, with regard to the superessential Divine generation,
   representing a body of God corporally generating God; and describing a
   word flowing out into air from a man's heart, which eructates it, and a
   breath, breathed forth from a mouth; and celebrating God-bearing bosoms
   embracing a son of God, bodily; or representing these things after the
   manner of plants, and producing certain trees, and branches, and
   flowers and roots, as examples; or fountains of waters y, bubbling
   forth; or seductive light productions of reflected splendours; or
   certain other sacred representations which explain superessential
   descriptions of God; but with regard to the intelligible providences of
   Almighty God, either gifts, manifestations, or powers, or properties,
   or repose, or abidings, or progressions, or distinctions, or unions,
   clothing Almighty God in human form, and in the varied shape of wild
   beasts and other living creatures, and plants, and stones; and
   attributing to Him ornaments of women, or weapons of savages; and
   assigning working in clay, and in a furnace, as it were to a sort of
   artisan; and placing under Him, horses and chariots and thrones; and
   spreading before Him certain dainty meats delicately cooked; and
   representing Him as drinking, and drunken, and sleeping, and suffering
   from excess. What would any one say concerning the angers, the griefs,
   the various oaths, the repentances, the curses, the revenges, the
   manifold and dubious excuses for the failure of promises, the battle of
   giants in Genesis, during which He is said to scheme against those
   powerful and great men, and this when they were contriving the
   building, not with a view to injustice towards other people, but on
   behalf of their own safety? And that counsel devised in heaven to
   deceive and mislead Achab [133] ; and those mundane and meritricious
   passions of the Canticles; and all the other sacred compositions which
   appear in the description of God, which stick at nothing, as
   projections, and multiplications of hidden things, and divisions of
   things one and undivided, and formative and manifold forms of the
   shapeless and unformed; of which, if any one were able to see their
   inner hidden beauty, he will find every one of them mystical and
   Godlike, and filled with abundant theological light. For let us not
   think, that the appearances of the compositions have been formed for
   their own sake, but that they shield the science unutterable and
   invisible to the multitude, since things all-holy are not within the
   reach of the profane, but are manifested to those only who are genuine
   lovers of piety, who reject all childish fancy respecting the holy
   symbols, and are capable to pass with simplicity of mind, and aptitude
   of contemplative faculty, to the simple and supernatural and elevated
   truth of the symbols. Besides, we must also consider this, that the
   teaching, handed down by the Theologians is two-fold--one, secret and
   mystical--the other, open and better known--one, symbolical and
   initiative--the other, philosophic and demonstrative;--and the unspoken
   is intertwined with the spoken. The one persuades, and desiderates the
   truth of the things expressed, the other acts and implants in Almighty
   God, by instructions in mysteries not learnt by teaching. And
   certainly, neither our holy instructors, nor those of the law, abstain
   from the God-befitting symbols, throughout the celebrations of the most
   holy mysteries. Yea, we see even the most holy Angels, mystically
   advancing things Divine through enigmas; and Jesus Himself, speaking
   the word of God in parables, and transmitting the divinely wrought
   mysteries, through a typical spreading of a table. For, it was seemly,
   not only that the Holy of holies should be preserved undefiled by the
   multitude, but also that the Divine knowledge should illuminate the
   human life, which is at once indivisible and divisible, in a manner
   suitable to itself; and to limit the passionless part of the soul to
   the simple, and most inward visions of the most godlike images; but
   that its impassioned part should wait upon, and, at the same time,
   strive after, the most Divine coverings, through the pre-arranged
   representations of the typical symbols, as such (coverings) are, by
   nature, congenial to it. And all those who are hearers of a distinct
   theology without symbols, weave in themselves a sort of type, which
   conducts them to the conception of the aforesaid theology.

   SECTION II.

   But also the very order of the visible universe sets forth the
   invisible things of Almighty God, as says both Paul and the infallible
   Word. Wherefore, also, the Theologians view some things politically and
   legally, but other things, purely and without flaw; and some things
   humanly, and mediately, but other things supermundanely and perfectly;
   at one time indeed, from the laws which are manifest, and at another,
   from the institutions which are unmanifest, as befits the holy writings
   and minds and souls under consideration. For the whole statement lying
   before them, and all its details, does not contain a bare history, but
   a vivifying perfection. We must then, in opposition to the vulgar
   conception concerning them, reverently enter within the sacred symbols,
   and not dishonour them, being as they are, products and moulds of the
   Divine characteristics, and manifest images of the unutterable and
   supernatural visions. For, not only are the superessential lights, and
   things intelligible, and, in one word, things Divine, represented in
   various forms through the typical symbols, as the superessential God,
   spoken of as fire, and the intelligible Oracles of Almighty God, as
   flames of fire; but further, even the godlike orders of the angels,
   both contemplated and contemplating, are described under varied forms,
   and manifold likenesses, and empyrean shapes. And differently must we
   take the same likeness of fire, when spoken with regard to the
   inconceivable God; and differently with regard to His intelligible
   providences or words; and differently respecting the Angels. The, one
   as causal, but the other as originated, and the third as participative,
   and different things differently, as their contemplation, and
   scientific arrangements suggest.

   And never must we confuse the sacred symbols haphazard, but we must
   unfold them suitably to the causes, or the origins, or the powers, or
   the orders, or the dignities of which they are explanatory tokens. And,
   in order that I may not extend my letter beyond the bounds of
   propriety, let us come at once to the very question propounded by you;
   and we affirm that every nourishment is perfective of those nourished,
   filling up their imperfection and their lack, and tending the weak, and
   guarding their lives, making to sprout, and renewing and bequeathing to
   them a vivifying wellbeing; and in one word, urging the slackening and
   imperfect, and contributing towards their comfort and perfection.

   SECTION III.

   Beautifully then, the super-wise and Good Wisdom is celebrated by the
   Oracles, as placing a mystical bowl, and pouring forth its sacred
   drink, but first setting forth the solid meats, and with a loud voice
   Itself benignly soliciting those who seek It. The Divine Wisdom, then,
   sets forth the two-fold food; one indeed, solid and fixed, but the
   other liquid and flowing forth; and in a bowl furnishes Its own
   providential generosities. Now the bowl, being spherical and open, let
   it be a symbol of the Providence over the whole, which at once expands
   Itself and encircles all, without beginning and without end. But since,
   even while going forth to all, It remains in Itself, and stands fixed
   in unmoved sameness; and never departing from Itself, the bowl also
   itself stands fixedly and unmovably. But Wisdom is also said to build a
   house for itself, and in it to set forth the solid meats and drinks,
   and the bowl, so that it may be evident to those who understand things
   Divine in a manner becoming God, that the Author of the being, and of
   the well being, of all things, is both an all-perfect providence, and
   advances to all, and comes into being in everything, and embraces them
   all; and on the other hand, He, the same, in the same, par excellence,
   is nothing in anything at all, but overtops the whole, Himself being in
   Himself, identically and always; and standing, and remaining, and
   resting, and ever being in the same condition and in the same way, and
   never becoming outside Himself, nor falling from His own session, and
   unmoved abiding, and shrine,--yea even, in it, benevolently exercising
   His complete and all-perfect providences, and whilst going forth to
   all, remaining by Himself alone, and standing always, and moving
   Himself; and neither standing, nor moving Himself, but, as one might
   say, both connaturally and supernaturally, having His providential
   energies, in His steadfastness, and His steadiness in His Providence.

   SECTION IV.

   But what is the solid food and what the liquid? For the Good Wisdom is
   celebrated as at once bestowing and providing these. I suppose then,
   that the solid food is suggestive of the intellectual and abiding
   perfection and sameness, within which, things Divine are participated
   as a stable, and strong, and unifying, and indivisible knowledge, by
   those contemplating organs of sense, by which the most Divine Paul,
   after partaking of wisdom, imparts his really solid nourishment; but
   that the liquid is suggestive of the stream, at once flowing through
   and to all; eager to advance, and further conducting those who are
   properly nourished as to goodness, through things variegated and many
   and divided, to the simple and invariable knowledge of God. Wherefore
   the divine and spiritually perceived Oracles are likened to dew, and
   water, and to milk, and wine, and honey; on account of their
   life-producing power, as in water; and growth-giving, as in milk; and
   reviving, as in wine; and both purifying and preserving, as in honey.
   For these things, the Divine Wisdom gives to those approaching it, and
   furnishes and fills to overflowing, a stream of ungrudging and
   unfailing good cheer. This, then, is the veritable good cheer; and, on
   this account, it is celebrated, as at once life-giving and nourishing
   and perfecting.

   SECTION V.

   According to this sacred explanation of good cheer, even Almighty God,
   Himself the Author of all good things, is said to be inebriated, by
   reason of the super-full, and beyond conception, and ineffable,
   immeasurableness, of the good cheer, or to speak more properly, good
   condition of Almighty God. For, as regards us, in the worst sense,
   drunkenness is both an immoderate repletion, and being out of mind and
   wits; so, in the best sense, respecting God, we ought not to imagine
   drunkenness as anything else beyond the super-full immeasurableness of
   all good things pre-existing in Him as Cause. But, even in respect to
   being out of wits, which follows upon drunkenness, we must consider the
   pre-eminence of Almighty God, which is above conception, in which He
   overtops our conception, as being above conception and above being
   conceived, and above being itself; and in short, Almighty God is
   inebriated with, and outside of, all good things whatever, as being at
   once a super-full hyperbole of every immeasurableness of them all; and
   again, as dwelling outside and beyond the whole. Starting then from
   these, we will take in the same fashion even the feasting of the pious,
   in the Kingdom of Almighty God. For He says, the King Himself will come
   and make them recline, and will Himself minister to them. Now these
   things manifest a common and concordant communion of the holy, upon the
   good things of God, and a church of the first born, whose names are
   written in heavens; and spirits of just men made perfect by all good
   things, and replete with all good things; and the reclining, we
   imagine, a cessation from their many labours, and a life without pain;
   and a godly citizenship in light and place of living souls, replete
   with every holy bliss, and an ungrudging provision of every sort of
   blessed goods; within which they are filled with every delight; whilst
   Jesus both makes them recline, and ministers to them, and furnishes
   this delight; and Himself bequeaths their everlasting rest; and at once
   distributes and pours forth the fulness of good things.

   SECTION VI.

   But, I well know you will further ask that the propitious sleep of
   Almighty God, and His awakening, should be explained. And, when we have
   said, that the superiority of Almighty God, and His incommunicability
   with the objects of His Providence is a Divine sleep, and that the
   attention to His Providential cares of those who need His discipline,
   or His preservation, is an awakening, you will pass to other symbols of
   the Word of God. Wherefore, thinking it superfluous that by running
   through the same things to the same. persons, we should seem to say
   different things, and, at the same time, conscious that you assent to
   things that are good, we finish this letter at what we have said,
   having set forth, as I think, more than the things solicited in your
   letters. Further, we send the whole of our Symbolical Theology, within
   which you will find, together with the house of wisdom, also the seven
   pillars investigated, and its solid food divided into sacrifices and
   breads. And what is the mingling of the wine; and again, What is the
   sickness arising from the inebriety of Almighty God? and in fact, the
   things now spoken of are explained in it more explicitly. And it is, in
   my judgment, a correct enquiry into all the symbols of the Word of God,
   and agreeable to the sacred traditions and truths of the Oracles.

   LETTER X. To John, Theologos, Apostle and Evangelist, imprisoned in the
   Isle of Patmos.

   I salute thee, the holy soul! O beloved one! and this for me is more
   appropriate than for most. Hail! O truly beloved! And to the truly
   Loveable and Desired, very beloved! Why should it be a marvel, if
   Christ speaks truly, and the unjust banish His disciples from their
   cities [134] , themselves bringing upon themselves their due, and the
   accursed severing themselves, and departing from the holy. Truly things
   seen are manifest images of things unseen. For, neither in the ages
   which are approaching, will Almighty God be Cause of the just
   separations from Himself, but they by having separated themselves
   entirely from Almighty God; even as we observe the others, becoming
   here already with Almighty God, since being lovers of truth, they
   depart from the proclivities of things material, and love peace in a
   complete freedom from all things evil, and a Divine love of all things
   good; and start their purification, even from the present life, by
   living, in the midst of mankind, the life which is to come, in a manner
   suitable to angels, with complete cessation of passion, and deification
   and goodness, and the other good attributes. As for you then, I would
   never be so crazy as to imagine that you feel any suffering; but I am
   persuaded that you ate sensible of the bodily sufferings merely to
   appraise them. But, as for those who are unjustly treating you, and
   fancying to imprison, not correctly, the sun of the Gospel, whilst
   fairly blaming them, I pray that by separating themselves from those
   things which they are bringing upon themselves they may be turned to
   the good, and may draw you to themselves, and may participate in the
   light. But for ourselves, the contrary will not deprive us of the
   all-luminous ray of John, who are even now about to read the record,
   and the renewal of this, thy true theology: but shortly after (for I
   will say it, even though it be rash), about to be united to you
   yourself. For, I am altogether trustworthy, from having learned, and
   reading the things made foreknown to you by God, that you will both be
   liberated from your imprisonment in Patmos, and will return to the
   Asiatic coast, and will perform there imitations of the good God, and
   will transmit them to those after you.

   LETTER XI. Dionysius to Apollophanes, Philosopher.

   At length I send a word to thee, O Love of my heart, and recall to thy
   memory the many anxieties and solicitudes, which I have formerly
   undergone on thy account." For thou rememberest with what a mild and
   benevolent disposition I have been accustomed to rebuke thy obstinacy
   in error, although with scant reason, in order that I might uproot
   those vain opinions with which thou wast deceived. But now, adoring the
   supreme toleration of the Divine long-suffering towards thee, I offer
   thee my congratulations, O part of my soul, now that you are turning
   your eyes to your soul's health. For, even the very things which
   formerly you delighted to spurn, you now delight to affirm; and the
   things that you used to reject with scorn, you now delight to enforce.
   For, often have I set before you, and that with great precision, what
   even Moses committed to writing, that man was first made by God, from
   mud, and the sins of the world were punished by the flood, and in
   process of time, that the same Moses, united in friendship with God, -
   performed many wonders, both in Egypt and the exodus from Egypt, by the
   power and action of the same God. Nor Moses only, but other divine
   prophets subsequently, published similar things, not infrequently, who
   long before foretold that God should take the nature of man from a
   Virgin. To which statement of mine, not once, but often, you replied,
   that you did not know whether these things were true, and that you were
   entirely ignorant, even who that Moses was, and whether he was white or
   black. Further, that you rejected with scorn the Gospel of Jesus
   Christ, Who is God of all Majesty--which you used to call mine.
   Further, that Paul, the globe trotter, and a scatterer of words, who
   was calling people from things terrestrial to things celestial, you
   were unwilling to receive. Lastly, you reproach me, as a turncoat, who
   had left the customs of my country's religion, and was leading people
   to iniquitous sacrilege, and urged me to unlearn the things in which I
   was placing my trust; or, at least, that I should put away other
   people's things, and deem it sufficient to keep what was my own, lest I
   should be found to detract from the honour due to divine deities, and
   the institutions of my fathers. But, after the supernal light of the
   paternal glory of His own will sent the rays of His own splendour upon
   the darkness of your mind, at once He put into my inmost heart, that I
   should recall to your mind the whole counsel of God. How, for instance,
   when we were staying in Heliopolis (I was then about twenty-five, and
   your age was nearly the same as mine), on a certain sixth day, and
   about the sixth hour, the sun, to our great surprise, became obscured,
   through the moon passing over it, not because it is a god, but because
   a creature of God, when its very true light was setting, could not bear
   to shine. Then I earnestly asked thee, what thou, O man most wise,
   thought of it. Thou, then, gave such an answer as remained fixed in my
   mind, and that no oblivion, not even that of the image of death, ever
   allowed to escape. For, when the whole orb had been throughout
   darkened, by a black mist of darkness, and the sun's disk had begun
   again to be purged and to shine anew, then taking the table of Philip
   Aridaeus, and contemplating the orbs of heaven, we learned, what was
   otherwise well known, that an eclipse of the sun could not, at that
   time, occur. Next, we observed that the moon approached the sun from
   the east, and intercepted its rays, until it covered the whole;
   whereas, at other times, it used to approach from the west. Further
   also, we noted that when it had reached the extreme edge of the sun,
   and had covered the whole orb, that it then went back towards the east,
   although that was a time which called neither for the presence of the
   moon, nor for the conjunction of the sun. I therefore, O treasury of
   manifold learning, since I was incapable of understanding so great a
   mystery, thus addressed thee--"What thinkest thou of this thing, O
   Apollophanes, mirror of learning?" "Of what mysteries do these
   unaccustomed portents appear to you to be indications?" Thou then, with
   inspired lips, rather than with speech of human voice, "These are, O
   excellent Dionysius," thou saidst, "changes of things divine." At last,
   when I had taken note of the day and year, and had perceived that, that
   time, by its testifying signs, agreed with that which Paul announced to
   me, once when I was hanging upon his lips, then I gave my hand to the
   truth, and extricated my feet from the meshes of error. Which truth,
   henceforth, I, with admiration, both preach and urge upon thee--which
   is life and way, and true light,--which lighteth every man coming into
   this world,--to which even thou at last, as truly wise, hast yielded.
   For thou yieldedst to life when thou renounced death. And surely thou
   hast, at length, acted in the best possible manner, if thou shalt
   adhere henceforth to the same truth, so as to associate with us more
   closely. For those lips will henceforth be on our side, by the
   splendour of whose words, as blunting the edge of my mind, thou hast
   been accustomed by pretexts brought from various quarters, and by a
   gorgeous glow of eloquence, to vex the innermost recesses of our
   breast;--yea, even sometimes to probe us sharply by occasional stings
   of malice. Wherefore as formerly, as thou thyself used to say, the
   knowledge of Christian doctrine, although savoury, was not savoury to
   thee, but when you had brought yourself to it, merely to taste, it
   shrank from your mental palate, and as it were, disdained to find a
   resting-place in your stomach; so now, after you have acquired a heart,
   intelligent and provident, elevate thyself to things supernal, and do
   not surrender, for things that are not, things which really are.
   Therefore in future, be so much more obstinate against those who have
   urged you to the false, as you showed yourself perverse towards us,
   when we invited you, with all our force, to the truth. For thus, I, in
   the Lord Jesus, Whose Presence is my being and my life, will henceforth
   die joyful, since thou also livest in Him.

PREFACE TO LITURGY.

   THIS Liturgy gives the doctrine of Dionysius in a liturgical form. The
   Greek original might be restored from the writings of Dionysius. No one
   could reasonably doubt that the Author of the Writings and the Liturgy
   was the same. This Liturgy should be compared with the Coptic Liturgy
   of Dionysius, Bishop of Athens, disciple of Paul, and with the Liturgy
   of St. Basil, adapted from this, as used by the Uniat Copts, translated
   by the Marquess of Bute. In my opinion, this Liturgy was written for
   the Therapeutae near Alexandria, described by Philo in his
   "contemplative life," who were Christians; who occupied themselves with
   the contemplation of the Divine Names, and the heavenly Hierarchy. It
   was written not earlier than the death of James, Apostle and Martyr,
   A.D. 42, and probably not later than A.D. 67; when Dionysius, at the
   request of St. Paul, left Athens to meet the Apostle at Rome, for the
   purpose of being sent by him to Gaul. A note of primitive antiquity is
   found in the description of the Church, as "from one end of the earth
   to the other." There is no "one, only, holy, Catholic, and Apostolic
   Orthodox Church," as in the later Liturgy of St. Basil. Some
   expressions are obscure, from the Latin Version, and it would be rash,
   without profound study, to venture to suggest the Greek text. In
   consequence of this, and other Liturgies, and his excellent writings,
   Dionysius was frequently commemorated in the diptychs as one of the
   Doctors of the Church.

   1st. The Prayer before the Pax [136] .

   Pr. [137] "O Lord God, Who art simplex, not compound, and hidden in
   essence sublime! God the Father, from Whom all paternity which is in
   heaven and earth is named [138] , Source of Divinity, of those who
   participate in the Divine Nature, and Perfector of those who attain
   perfection; Good above all good, and Beautiful above all beautiful;
   Peaceful repose, Peace, Concord and Union of all souls; compose the
   dissensions which divide us from one another, and lead them back to an
   union with charity, which has a kind of similitude to Thy sublime
   essence: and as Thou art One above all, and we, one, through the
   unanimity of a good mind; that we may be found before Thee simplex and
   not divided, whilst celebrating this mystery; and that through the
   embraces of Charity and bonds of Love, we may be spiritually one, both
   with ourselves and with one another, through that Thy Peace pacifying
   all; through the Grace and Compassion and Love towards man of Thine
   Only-begotten Son; through Whom, and with Whom is due to Thee, glory,
   honour and dominion, with Thy most holy Spirit." P. "Amen." Pr. "Pax"
   (to all). P. "And with thy spirit." D. "Let each one give the Peace."
   P. "All." D. "Post." P. "Before Thee, O Lord." Pr. "Giver of Holiness,
   and distributor of every good, O Lord, Who sanctifiest every rational
   creature with sanctification, which is from Thee; sanctify, through Thy
   Holy Spirit, us Thy servants, who bow before Thee; free us from all
   servile passions of sin, from envy, treachery, deceit, hatred,
   enmities, and from him, who works the same, that we may be worthy,
   holily to complete the ministry of these life-giving Sacraments,
   through the heavenly Pontiff, Jesus Christ, Thine Only-begotten Son,
   through Whom, and with Whom, is due to Thee, glory and honour." P.
   "Amen." Pr. "Essentially existing, and from all ages; Whose nature is
   incomprehensible, Who art near and present to all, without any change
   of Thy sublimity; Whose goodness every existing thing longs for and
   desires; the intelligible indeed, and creatures endowed with
   intelligence, through intelligence; those endowed with sense, through
   their senses; Who, although Thou art One essentially, nevertheless art
   present with us, and amongst us, in this hour, in which Thou hast
   called and led us to these Thy holy mysteries; and hast made us worthy
   to stand before the sublime throne of Thy majesty, and to handle the
   sacred vessels of Thy ministry with our impure hands: take away from
   us, O Lord, the cloke of iniquity in which we are enfolded, as from
   Jesus, the son of Josedec the High Priest, Thou didst take away the
   filthy garments, and adorn us with piety and justice, as Thou didst
   adorn him with a vestment of glory; that clothed with Thee alone, as it
   were with a garment, and being like temples crowned with glory, we may
   see Thee unveiled with a mind divinely illuminated, and may feast,
   whilst we, by communicating therein, enjoy this sacrifice set before
   us; and render to Thee glory and praise." P. "Amen." D. "Let us stand
   becomingly." P. "The Mercies of God." Pr. "Charity." P. "And with thy
   spirit." Pr. "Lift up your hearts." P. "We lift them to the Lord." Pr.
   "Let us give thanks to the Lord." P. "It is meet and right." Priest
   (bending low), "For truly the celebration of Thy benefits, O Lord,
   surpasses, the powers of mind, of speech, and of thought; neither is
   sufficient every mouth, mind and tongue, to glorify Thee worthily. For,
   by Thy word the heavens were made, and by the breath of Thy mouth all
   the celestial powers; all the lights in the firmament, sun and moon,
   sea and dry land, and whatever is in them. The voiceless, by their
   silence, the vocal, by their voices, words and hymns, perpetually bless
   Thee; because Thou art essentially good and beyond all praise, existing
   in Thy essence incomprehensibly. This visible and sensible creature
   praises Thee, and also that intellectual, placed above sensible
   perception. Heaven and earth glorify Thee. Sea and air proclaim Thee.
   The sun, in his course, praises Thee; the Moon, in her changes,
   venerates Thee. Troops of Archangels, and hosts of Angels; those
   virtues, more sublime than the world and mental faculty, send
   benedictions to Thine abode. Rays of light, eminent and hidden, send
   their sanctus to Thy glory. Principalities and Orders praise Thee, with
   their Jubilate. Powers and dominions venerate Thee. Virtues, Thrones
   and Seats inaccessible exalt Thee. Splendours of light eternal--mirrors
   without flaw--holy essences--recipients of wisdom sublime--beyond all,
   investigators of the will hidden from all, in clearest modulations of
   inimitable tones, and by voices becoming a rational creature; many eyed
   Cherubim of most subtle movement, bless Thee. Seraphin, furnished with
   six wings intertwined, cry Sanctus unto Thee. Those very ones, who veil
   their faces with their wings, and cover their feet with wings, and
   flying on every side, and clapping with their wings, (that they may not
   be devoured by Thy devouring fire) sing one to another with equal
   harmony of all, sweet chants, pure from every thing material, rendering
   to Thee, eternal glory; crying with one hymn, worthy of God, and
   saying," P. "Holy, holy, holy." Priest (bending)--"Holy art Thou, O God
   the Father, Omnipotent, Maker and Creator of every creature--Invisible
   and visible, and sensible; Holy art Thou, O God, the Only-begotten Son,
   Power and Wisdom of the Father, Lord and our Saviour Jesus Christ; Holy
   art Thou, O God, the Holy Spirit, Perfector and Sanctifier of Saints.
   Triad, Holy and undivided:--co-essential and of equal glory, Whose
   compassion towards our race is most effusive. Thou art holy, and making
   all things holy. Who didst not leave that, our very race, in exile from
   Paradise, although in the meantime involved in every kind of sin, but
   wast manifested to it by the Word, Who, in the presence of the" world,
   suffered extreme poverty; it in very truth, He, the Word, took, being
   made like to it in all things, sin excepted, that it might make Him
   prepared beforehand unto holiness, and disposed for this life-giving
   feast. (Raising his voice) Who being conceived, formed and configured
   by the Holy Spirit, and from virgin blood of the Virgin Mary, holy
   genitrix of God, was born indeed Man, and from the pure and most holy
   body of the same, and receiving Deity in Flesh, whilst the law and
   properties of nature were preserved, but in a manner beyond nature, and
   was acknowledged God in the Spirit, and Man in the flesh; and inasmuch
   as the Word existed before the ages, from Thee, as was worthy of God,
   was born, and by power and miracles, such as became the Maker of all,
   was testified that He was such, from the very fact that He has freely
   imparted a complete healing and a perfect salvation to the whole human
   race. Likewise, in the end and consummation of His dispensation on our
   behalf, and before His saving Cross, He took bread into His pure and
   holy hands, and looked to Thee, O God the Father; giving thanks, He
   blessed, sanctified, brake and gave to His disciples, the holy
   Apostles, saying, "Take and eat from it and believe that it is my body,
   that same, which for you and for many is broken and given, for the
   expiation of faults, the remission of sins, and eternal life." P.
   "Amen." Pr. "Likewise, in the same manner, over the cup also, which He
   mingled with wine and water, He gave thanks, blessed, sanctified, and
   gave to the same disciples and holy apostles, saying, Take, drink from
   it, all of you, and believe that this is My blood of the new covenant,
   which is shed and given for you and for many, for the expiation of
   faults, remission of sins, and eternal life.'" P. "Amen."

   Pr. "Himself also, through the same holy Apostles, gave a precept to
   the whole company and congregation of the faithful, saying, This do to
   the memory of Me, and as oft as ye shall eat this bread and drink the
   commixture which is in this cup, and shall celebrate this feast, ye
   shall perform a commemoration of My death until I come.'" P. "Of Thy
   death, O Lord, we perform a memorial." Pr. "Obeying, then, Thy
   sovereign precept, and celebrating a commemoration of Thy death and
   resurrection, through this sacrifice in perpetual mystery, we await
   also Thy second coming, the renovation of our race, and the
   vivification of our mortality. For, not simply, but with glory worthy
   of God, in Spirit ineffable, Thou wilt terribly come, and seated upon
   the lofty throne of Thy majesty, Thou wilt exact the acknowledgment of
   Thy royal power, from all things created and made: and justly, Thou
   wilt take vengeance for Thy image upon those who have corrupted it
   through evil passions. This sacrifice, here celebrated, we commemorate
   to Thee, O Lord, and the sufferings which Thou didst endure on the
   Cross for us. Be propitious, O Good, and Lover of men, in that hour
   full, of fear and trembling, to this congregation of those adoring
   Thee, and to all sons of the holy Church, bought by Thy precious blood.
   May coals of fire be kept from those who are tinged with Thy blood, and
   sealed by Thy sacraments in Thy holy Name, as formerly the Babylonian
   flame from the youths of the house of Hanania; for neither do we know
   others beside Thee, O God, nor in other have we hope of attaining
   salvation, since indeed Thou art the Helper and Saviour of our race;
   and on this account, our wise Church, through all our lips and tongues,
   implores Thee, and through Thee, and with Thee, Thy Father, saying"--

   P. "Have mercy." Pr. "We also." D. "How tremendous is this hour." (The
   Priest bending, says the prayer of the invocation of the Holy Spirit.)
   Pr. "I invoke Thee, O God the Father, have mercy upon us, and wash
   away, through Thy grace, the uncleanness of my evil deeds; destroy,
   through Thy mercy, what I have done, worthy of wrath; for I do not
   extend my hands to Thee with presumption, for I am not able even to
   look to heaven on account of the multitude of my iniquities and the
   filth of my wickedness. But, strengthening my mind, in Thy
   loving-kindness, grace and long-suffering, I crave Thy holy Spirit,
   that Thou wouldst send Him upon me, and upon these oblations, here set
   forth, and upon Thy faithful people." Pr. "Hear me, O Lord." P. "Kyrie
   eleison," three times. Pr. "Through His alighting upon them, and His
   overshadowing, may He make this bread indeed, living body, and
   procuring life to our souls; body salutary--body celestial--body saving
   our souls and bodies--body of our Lord God and Saviour, Jesus
   Christ--for remission of sins, and eternal life, for those receiving
   it." P. "Amen." Pr. "And the commixture, which is in this cup, may He
   make living blood, and procuring life to all our souls; blood
   salutary--blood celestial--blood saving our souls and bodies--blood of
   our Lord God and Saviour Jesus Christ, for remission of sins to those
   receiving them." P. "Amen." Pr. "Further, according to the tradition,
   and Divine recommendation of those, who were eye witnesses of Thy
   mysteries, and interpreters of Thy wonderful acts, we offer this
   Eucharist before Thee, O Lord, and through it we commemorate Thy
   charity towards us, and the universal dispensation of Thine
   Only-begotten One, in this world, that Thou wouldst also be reminded
   through it of Thy mercy, cognate and natural to Thee, which, at all
   hours, is shed upon Thy creatures, and wouldst snatch us from the
   wrath, reserved for the wicked; and from the punishments of those who
   work iniquity; and from the cruel attack of demons, who attack our
   souls, when we shall go hence; and wouldst make us worthy of Thy
   kingdom, and the habitations of those who have kept Thy precepts; and
   we will render to Thee, glory and the giving of thanks, &c." P. "Amen."
   Pr. (bending) "By Thy words, that cannot lie, and by Thy most true
   teachings, Thou hast said, O Lord, that great is the joy in heaven over
   one sinner that repenteth. Rejoice then now, O Lord, in the conversion
   of Thy servants, who stand here before Thee; add also, exultation over
   us, to the souls of the pious and just Fathers -- Patriarchs --
   Prophets -- Apostles --Preachers -- Evangelists -- Martyrs --
   Confessors --Zealots" of Divine Worship--Benefactors--Givers of
   Alms--of those who minister to the necessities of the poor--and from
   all, may there be one act of praise to-day, before Thee, at this holy
   Altar, and in the heavenly Jerusalem." (Elevating his voice) "And on
   account of these, and other things of the same kind, may Thy holy
   Church, which is from one end of the earth to the other, be
   established, and preserved in tranquillity and peace, in doctrines
   evangelical and apostolical, by Divine Hierarchs, rightly dispensing
   the word of truth, and instructing, by the dogmas of true religion:
   through holy Priests, who embrace the word of life, and carry
   themselves illustriously in dispensing Thy celestial mysteries: through
   Deacons, who are modest, and perform the pure and royal ministry
   without flaw, through true, faithful ones, who occupy themselves in
   words and acts worthy of a Christian; through choirs of virgins of each
   sex, bearing about in their members the life-giving mortification of
   Thy Only-begotten Son. And from hence, in one troop, may we all be sent
   to that Church, the Jerusalem of the firstborn, whose names are written
   in the heavens, and there let us spiritually glorify Thee, O God the
   Father, and Thine Only-begotten Son, and Thy Holy Spirit." P. "Amen."
   Pr. "Assist also, O Lord, all those who assist Thy Holy Church, by
   offerings--by tenths--by ministry--and by oblations; and those also,
   who ask the prayers of our littleness, give to them the object of those
   their prayers, O Lord, Lover of men." (Raising his voice) "Send also
   perfect attention and full health to all those who have the charge of
   the poor, who provide food for orphans and widows, and visit the infirm
   and afflicted. Restore to them, here indeed abundance and goods, there
   also delights incorruptible, because thou art Lord of each age, and
   distributor of immense reward. And to Thee beseems beneficence, both
   here and there, and to Thine Only-begotten Son." P. "Amen." Pr.
   (bending) "Restrain, O King of Kings, the wrath of kings, mitigate the
   fury of soldiers, take away wars and seditions, cast down the pride of
   heretics, and the sentences pronounced against us by Justice, may Thy
   love for mankind overcome, and turn into the gentleness of benignity";
   (raising his voice) "Tranquillity and Peace from Thee, concede to the
   earth and all its inhabitants, visit it with Thy benefits and the care
   of Thy mercy, with a good and temperate condition of atmosphere,
   copiousness of fruits, and abundance of crops, and variety of flowers;
   preserve it from all pests of fury, and all unjust attacks of enemies,
   both spiritual and sensible, that without any injury of passion, we may
   sing perpetual hymns of praise, to Thee and to Thine Only-begotten
   Son." P. "Amen." Pr. (bending) "At this altar, and at that more exalted
   one in heaven, may there be a good remembrance of all those, who, out
   of the world, have pleased Thee--chiefly indeed of the Holy genitrix of
   God, of John the Messenger, Baptist and Forerunner, of Peter and Paul,
   and of the holy company of the Apostles, of Stephen also, and of the
   whole multitude of Martyrs, and of all those, who, before them, with
   them and after them, have pleased, and do please Thee." (Raising his
   voice) "And since indeed Thou art Omnipotent, to the company of those
   beloved ones and to Thy family, join our weakness, O Lord, to that
   blessed congregation, to this Divine part, that, through them may be
   received our oblations and prayers, before the lofty throne of Thy
   Majesty, inasmuch as we are weak and infirm, and wanting in confidence
   before Thee. Forsooth, our sin and our righteousness are as nothing in
   comparison with the ocean, broad and immense, of Thy mercy. Looking
   then, into the hearts of each, send to each one good returns for their
   petitions, that in all and in each may be adored and praised, Thy
   Majesty, and that of Thine Only-begotten Son." P. "Amen." Pr. (bending)
   "Remember, O Lord, all Bishops, Doctors and Prelates of Thy holy
   Church, those, who from James, Apostle, Bishop and Martyr, to this
   present day, have pleased, and do please Thee." (Raising his voice)
   "Engraft in us, O Lord, their true faith, and their zeal for the true
   religion; their sincere charity without defect; their morals without
   stain; in order that, adhering to their footsteps, we may be partakers
   of their reward, and of the crowns of victory which are prepared for
   them in Thy heavenly kingdom, and there, together with them, we may
   sing to Thee, Glory unceasing, and to Thy Only-begotten Son." P.
   "Amen." Pr. (bending) "Remember, O Lord, all those who are fallen
   asleep, who have laid themselves down in Thy hope, in the true faith.
   More especially, and by name, our Fathers, Brothers and Masters, and
   those, on behalf of whom, and by favour of whom, this holy oblation is
   offered," (raising his voice) "join, O Lord, their names, with the
   names of Thy Saints in the blessed habitation of those, who feast and
   rejoice in Thee; not recalling against them the memory of their sins,
   nor bringing to their memory the things which they have foolishly done.
   For no one is tied to the flesh, and at the same time, innocent in Thy
   sight. For One alone has been seen on earth without sin, Jesus Christ,
   Thine Only-begotten Son; Simplex [139] , who came to composition,
   through whom we also have hope of obtaining mercy." P. "Keep quiet."
   Pr. (bending) "Remitting our and their voluntary sins, knowingly or
   ignorantly committed. Be propitious, O Lord, Lover of men." (Raising
   his voice) "And grant to us a peaceful end, departure with mercy, that
   we may stand without fault on the right hand; and, with open face, and
   confidence, run to meet the arising of Thine Only-begotten Son, and His
   second and glorious manifestation from heaven; and may hear from Him,
   that blessed voice, which He shall pronounce at the last day to the
   Blessed." "Blessed of my Father receive the inheritance of the heavenly
   kingdom," "that in this, as in all, may be glorified and praised, Thy
   most venerated Name." P. "That, &c." Pr. "Peace." P. "And with thy
   spirit." The Priest breaks the Host, and says the prayer, before "Our
   Father." Pr, "Father of all, and Beginning, Which is above all
   things--Light eternal, and Fountain of Light, Which illuminates all
   natures endowed with reason; Who callest the poor from the dust, and
   raisest the beggar from the dunghill; and hast called us, lost,
   rejected, and infirm, to the liberty and household dignity of Thy sons,
   through Thy beloved Son, grant to us, that we may appear in Thy sight,
   holy sons, and not unworthy of the name; and may also perform all our
   ministry after a blameless manner; and with purity of soul, and
   cleanness of intellect, and with a godly mind, whenever we invoke Thee,
   God the Father Omnipotent, holy and heavenly, we pray and say, Our
   Father, which art in heaven." P. "Hallowed be Thy Name, &c." Pr. "Free
   us, Thy servants and sons, from all temptations, most difficult, and
   surpassing our forces; and from all griefs, which can bring loss to our
   body or soul. Guard us, at the same time from the evil one, and from
   his universal power, and from his most pernicious devices. For Thou art
   King of all, and to Thee we render glory." P. "Amen." Pr. "Peace," P.
   "And with thy spirit." D. "Before" (Ante). P. "Before Thee, O Lord."
   (Coram.) Pr. "Look, O Lord, upon Thy faithful people, who bend before
   Thee, and await Thy gift, and contemplate the deposit of the Sacraments
   of Thy Only-begotten, O God the Father. Take not away Thy grace from
   us, and cast us not away from Thy ministry, and from participation in
   Thy sacraments, but prepare us, that we may be pure and without flaw,
   and worthy of this feast; and that, with a conscience unblamable, we
   may ever enjoy His precious body and blood; and in a life, glorious and
   endless, may recline in a spiritual habitation, and may feast at the
   table of Thy kingdom, and may render to Thee glory and praise." P.
   "Amen." Pr. "Peace." P. "And with thy spirit." D. "With fear." Pr.
   "Holy things to holy persons." P. "One holy Father." D. "Let us stand
   becomingly." P. "Before Thee." Pr. "We give thanks to Thee, O Lord, and
   with grateful mind we acknowledge Thy loving-kindness; because, from
   nothing, Thou hast led us forth to that which we are, and hast made us
   members of Thy household, and sons of Thy sacraments; and hast
   entrusted this religious ministry to us, and hast made us worthy of
   this spiritual table. Preserve in us, O Lord, the deposit of Thy Divine
   Mysteries, that we may frame and complete our life in Thy sight, after
   the fashion of the angels; that we may be secured and inseparable
   through the reception of Thy holy (mysteries); performing Thy great and
   perfect will, and may be found ready for that last consummation, and to
   stand before Thy Majesty, and may be made worthy of the pleasure of Thy
   kingdom, through the grace, mercy and love towards man, of Thy
   Only-begotten Son, through Whom, and with Whom, is due to Thee, glory,
   honour, &c." P. "Amen." Pr. "Peace." P. "And with thy spirit." D.
   "After" (Post), P. "Before Thee, O Lord." Pr. "O Christ, the King of
   Glory, and Father of the Age to come; Holy Sacrifice; heavenly
   Hierarch; Lamb of God, Who takest away the sin of the world, spare the
   sins of Thy people, and dismiss the foolishness of Thy flock. Preserve
   us, through, the communication of Thy Sacraments, from every sin,
   whether it be committed by word, or thought, or deed; and from whatever
   makes us far from the familiarity of Thy household, that our bodies may
   be guarded by Thy body, and our souls renewed through Thy sacraments.
   And may Thy benediction, O Lord, be in our whole man, within and
   without; and may Thou be glorified in us, and by us, and may Thy right
   hand rest upon us, and that of Thy blessed Father, and of Thy most holy
   Spirit." P. "Amen." D. "Bless, O Lord."

OBJECTIONS TO GENUINENESS.

   THE most plausible objection to the genuineness of these writings is
   thus expressed by Dupin: "Eusebius and Jerome wrote an accurate
   catalogue of each author known to them--with a few obscure
   exceptions,--and yet never mention the writings of the Areopagite."
   Great is the rejoicing in the House of the Anti-Areopagites over this
   PROOF;--but what are the facts? Eusebius acknowledges that innumerable
   works have not come to him--Jerome disclaims either to know or to give
   an accurate catalogue either of authors or works. The Library of
   Caesarea contained three hundred thousand volumes, according to the
   modest computation of Doublet, according to Schneider, many
   more--Jerome says there are some writings, so illustrious in
   themselves, that they will not suffer from not being mentioned by him;
   Jerome fallows Dionysius on the Heavenly Hierarchy; Jerome's Catalogue
   of Illustrious Men contains one hundred and thirty-five names.

   Josephus is mentioned for his testimony to Christ --Seneca, for his
   correspondence with St, Paul--Philo, for his description of the
   Therapeutse of Alexandria. Yet Dupin would have the unwary infer that
   Jerome gives a full catalogue of each Author known to him, with a few
   obscure exceptions.

   The "Ecclesiastical History" of Eusebius treats of the nature of
   Christ, the companions of the Apostles, the Martyrdoms--the succession
   of Bishops--the persecutions--the folk-lore of the Church to the fourth
   Century. The Book would fill about 125 pages, yet Dupin would have us
   believe that he gives a complete catalogue; He does not give the
   writings of Hymenseus and Narcissus, of Athenagoras, and Pantaenus, nor
   a complete list of Clement, Origen, and Dionysius of Alexandria. His
   silence, in my opinion, is owing to "odium theologicum." According to
   Eusebius, Jesus is dittos; according to Dionysius, Jesus is haplous;
   both true when properly understood, but when misunderstood--"Hinc
   lachrymae illae"--Dupin formed his premise for his conclusion, not from
   facts [140] .

   FALLACY OF NAMES.

   Pearson, Daillé, Blundellum, Erasmus, Valla, Westcott, Lupton,
   pronounce against the genuineness. Who are you? But Pearson demolishes
   Daillé; Vossius pulverises Blundellum; Erasmus repudiates Valla. Dr.
   Westcott, following Dupin, assumes the non-genuineness, but his
   literary instinct places his Article on Dionysius before that on
   Origen. Dean Colet bumps the scale against Mr. Lupton.

   Pearson, in the xth Chapter of Ignatii Vindiciae, gives the shortest
   and best summary in favour of the genuineness. Speaking of the scholars
   of his own day, he says, "No one is so ignorant as not to know that
   these writings were recognised as genuine by the best judges in the
   sixth, fifth, fourth, and third centuries." Unhappily, he also said,
   Every "erudite" person regarded them in his day as written in the
   fourth century, and he assumed the date of Eusebius' death, as the date
   of the works, to account for his silence. Hence every inerudite person,
   who wished to pass for erudite, maintained that opinion for his own
   reputation. But when Pearson had re-surveyed the evidence, he
   confessed, with shame, that though he had given, what seemed to him a
   true opinion, he left the decision of the whole matter to the judgment
   of a more learned person.

   Erasmus, in his "Institutio" of a Christian Prince, writes
   thus:--"Divus ille Dionysius qui fecit tres Hierarchias." In his prime
   work, "ratio verae religionis," Erasmus not only enumerates the "Divine
   Names," the "Mystic and Symbolic Theology," but calls them, not Stoic,
   not Platonic, not Aristotelian, but "celestial" philosophy. He so
   moulds Dionysius into his book, that it becomes Dionysius writing
   elegant Latin. The only reason which outweighed with him all external
   testimony, was, that Erasmus could not imagine that any man, living in
   apostolic times, and so far removed from the age of Erasmus, could
   possibly have penned such a mirror of apostolic doctrine. How could the
   Areopagite, though disciple of Paul, and familiar friend of John
   Theologus, possibly be so learned as the author of these writings? Such
   is the testimony of the two Theologians who have been permitted to be
   doubtful of the genuineness.

   GREGORY OF TOURS [141] .

   Gregory is the great authority of those who think that the St. Denis of
   France is not identical with Dionysius the Areopagite. The authority is
   worthy of their critical acumen. Gregory collects the more obscure
   martyrdoms, in Gaul, under Nero, and subsequent Emperors. He gives
   several martyrdoms under Nero, and thus proves the Apostolic
   Evangelisation of Gaul. Gregory quotes, and misquotes, and
   misunderstands the ancient document [142] , "Concerning [143] seven men
   sent by St. Peter into Gaul,--in Gallias--to preach." "Under Claudius
   --sub CLDIO--Peter the Apostle sent certain disciples into Gaul to
   preach,--they were, Trophimus, Paulus, Martial, Austremonius, Gatianus,
   Saturninus, Valerius, and many companions."--These men were sent A.D.
   42-43. Gregory omits Valerius, and inserts Dionysius --who was not
   converted to the Christian Faith till A.D. 44 or 49. Then Gregory
   misreads "Claudio "for "consulibus Decio," and adds, "Grato" as the
   fellow-consul. Thus a disciple of the Apostles, sent by Clement,
   successor of Peter, arrives in Gaul A.D. 250, and the identical names
   of his companions recur miraculously in the third century. At the very
   time that Trophimus [144] is thus supposed to have arrived at Aries, we
   have a letter from Cyprian, A.D. 254, urging Pope Stephen to depose
   Marcion, 15th or 18th Bishop of Aries from Trophimus. Such is the basis
   upon which our critical friends build their house upon the sand.

   THE PÈRES BOLANDISTES.

   The Pères Bolandistes are a wonder in Christendom. They are critical,
   and yet follow the gross blunder of Gregory of Tours. They belong to
   the papal obedience, and yet prefer Gregory of Tours when wrong, to
   Gregory XIII., when right. They pronounce the solemn declaration of
   Pope John XIXth, "that Martial of Limoges was an apostolic man [145] ,"
   as of no historic value. They think that St. John Damascene did not
   possess the same critical apparatus for proving the authenticity of the
   writings of Dionysius, that we possess in the xixth Century. Their
   "actes authentiques [146] " of Dionysius acknowledge that he was sent
   to Gaul by Clement, successor of Peter; and yet they affirm that he
   arrived in Gaul, A.D, 250. After Clement I., who succeeded Peter and
   Paul, there was not another Clement, Bishop of Rome, for a thousand
   years [147] . Happily, Les petits Bolandistes are more rational and
   critical than their Pères.

   GENERAL OBJECTION.

   "The style, the theological learning, the language and allusions, prove
   the writings written after the apostolic age."

   Is the Epistolary style the proof? St. Paul, St. John, St. Peter, St.
   Luke, and nearly the whole of the New Testament is written under the
   form of Epistles. The Epistle of St. James,--the first written in the
   Canon of the New Testament,--will bear comparison with the book of Job
   for ornate diction. Consult the marginal references to the Epistle of
   St. Peter, to see the scriptural knowledge of the Apostles. Men use the
   testimony of the High Priests, that the Apostles were unlearned and
   ignorant men, but omit their testimony that they took knowledge of
   them, that they had been with Jesus; and the further testimony, that
   Jesus opened their understanding, that they should understand the
   testimony of the Scriptures, respecting Himself; and further, that the
   Holy Spirit should recall to them whatever He had said to them. Those
   who would rather assume twenty miracles, than acknowledge one natural
   fact, surmise, that a Syrian, in the ivth century, may have written
   Greek permeated with technical expressions of Plato and Aristotle.
   There is not a single allusion to persons or events after the first
   century, unless it be supposed that the Epistle of Ignatius, A.D. 108,
   is quoted. The works abound in names recorded in the New Testament. The
   Apostolic Epistles allude to the leaven of heresy already working. The
   Antwerp edition gives about five hundred references to Holy Scripture
   in the Writings of Dionysius. He quotes every book in the Bible, except
   the two last particular Epistles of St. John, or John Presbyter.
   Dionysius writes four letters to Gaius, to whom St. John wrote his
   third Epistle. We have, therefore, in the writings of this Apostolic
   man, a proof that the Canonical Scriptures were quoted as the Oracles
   of God, in the first century, and a triumphant testimony that

   Faith is more trustworthy than criticism.

   Thanks be to God!

  DIONYSIUS THE AREOPAGITE
  AND
  THE ALEXANDRINE SCHOOL.

   ALEXANDRIA became the home of Christian Philosophy, but Athens was its
   birthplace. Pantaenus and Ammonius-Saccus were chief founders of the
   Alexandrine School. They were both Christian. They both drew their
   teaching from the Word of God, " the Fountain of Wisdom," and from the
   writings of Hierotheus, and Dionysius the Areopagite--Bishops of
   Athens. For several centuries there had been a Greek preparation for
   the Alexandrine School. As the Old Testament was a Schoolmaster,
   leading to Christ, so the Septuagint, Pythagoras, Plato, Aristobulus,
   Philo, and Apollos were heralds who prepared the minds of men for that
   fulness of light and truth in Jesus Christ, which, in Alexandria,
   clothed itself in the bright robes of Divine Philosophy.

   Pantaenus was born in Athens, a.d. 120, and died in Alexandria, a.d.
   213. He was Greek by nationality, and Presbyter of the Church in,
   Alexandria by vocation. First, Stoic, then Pythagorean, he became
   Christian some time before a.d. 186, at which date he was appointed
   chief instructor in the Didaskeleion, by Demetrius, Bishop of
   Alexandria. Pantaenus recognised the preparation for the Christian
   Faith in the Greek Philosophy. Anastasius-Sinaita describes him as "one
   of the early expositors who agreed with each other in treating the
   first six days of Creation as prophetic of Christ and the whole
   Church."

   Eusebius says, that "Pantaenus expounded the treasures of the Divine
   dogmas preserved direct, as from father to son, from St. Paul and other
   Apostles. Phptius records that Pantaenus was pupil of those who had
   seen the Apostles, but that he certainly had not listened to any of
   them themselves. Now, if Pantaenus was pupil of those who had seen the
   Apostles, and yet had, not listened to their oral teaching, it is
   natural to infer that he was pupil through their writings. I am a pupil
   of Dr. Pusey, but I never listened to his oral teaching; I am pupil
   through his writings. Now, there exist, to this day, the writings of
   two Presbyters who had seen the Apostles--both, converts to the faith
   through St. Paul,---whose writings contain the treasures of the Divine
   dogmas, received from St. Paul and the other Apostles. Those two
   Presbyters are Hierotheus and Dionysius the Areopagite, both ordained
   Bishop of Athens by St. Paul. Dionysius the Areopagite expressly calls,
   St. Paul his "chief initiator," and as such, gives his teaching on the
   holy Angels, in the sixth chapter of the Heavenly Hierarchy; and
   frequently describes St. Paul as his "chief instructor."

   If, then, we can prove that the writings of Dionysius existed before
   and were known in Alexandria, when Pantaenus delivered his lectures in
   that city, we may fairly infer that Pantaenus would know, and knowing,
   would use, the writings penned by the Chief of his own Areopagus, and
   Bishop of his own Athens.

   Historical criticism does not permit us to reject probabilities, merely
   because they confirm the Christian Faith.

   Dexter, in his Chronicle, collected from the Archives of Toledo and
   other churches in Spain, gives this testimony:--

   "U.C. 851 (a.d. 98). Dionysius Areopagita dicat Eugenio Marcello,
   dicto, propter ingenii excellentiam, Timotheo, libros de Divinis
   Nominibus."

   Dionysius of Alexandria, writing to Tope Sixtus II., c. 250, respecting
   the writings of Dionysius the Areopagite, affirms "that no one can
   intelligently dispute their paternity--that no one penetrated more
   profoundly than Dionysius into the mysterious depths of Holy
   Scripture--that Dionysius was disciple of St. Paul, and piously
   governed the Church of Athens." If, then, the Bishops of Alexandria and
   Rome exchanged letters only a few years after the death of Pantaenus,
   and only seven years after the death of Ammonius, and in those letters
   affirmed the writings to be undoubtedly written by Dionysius the
   Areopagite, it would be the height of absurdity to affirm that such
   writings were unknown to Pantaenus and Ammonius.

   But we do not need to base our proof on mere supposition. Routh gives
   two fragments of Pantaenus. The second is a distinct echo of Dionysius.
   In Divine Names (c. 7), Dionysius discusses how Almighty God knows
   existing things, and explains the text; "He, knowing all things before
   their birth" as proving that "not as learning existing things from
   existing things, but from Himself, and in Himself, as Cause, the Divine
   Being pre-holds and pre-comprehends the notions and essence of all
   things, not approaching each several thing according to its kind, but
   knowing and containing all things within one grasp of the cause. Thus
   Almighty God knows existing things, not by a knowledge of existing
   things, but by that of Himself." Dionysius, c. V. s. 8, speaking of
   creation, declares that the Divine and good volitions of Almighty God
   define and produce existing things.

   Pantaenus teaches the same: "Neither does He know things sensible
   sensibly (aisthetos), nor things intelligible intellectually. For it is
   not possible that He, Who is above all things, should comprehend things
   being, after things being (kata ta onta), but we affirm that He knows
   things being" as His own volitions . . . yea, as His own volitions,
   Almighty God knows things being, since by willing (thelon), He made all
   things being."

   In Mystic Theology, c. V., Dionysius says, "Almighty God does not know
   existing things, qua existing." The teaching of Ammonius-Saccus is the
   same; Ammonius uses the word boulema, Dionysius and Pantaenus,
   thelemata, of God, as Source of Creation.

   But, though the known fragments of Pantaenus are few, we possess
   abundant writings of two pupils, Clement of Alexandria and Origen, from
   which we may gather the teaching of their master. Clement speaks of
   Pantaenus as his "great instructor and collaborator." Such is the
   similarity between the writings of Clement and Dionysius, that some
   have hazarded the conjecture that Clement the Philosopher, mentioned by
   Dionysius, was Clement of Alexandria! I give only one familiar
   illustration. Clement writes: "As then, those riding at anchor at sea,
   drag the anchor, but do not drag it to themselves, but themselves to
   the anchor, thus those who are drawn to God in the gnostic life, find
   themselves unconsciously led to God." Dionysius, D. N., c. III. s. 1,
   says, "or, as if after we have embarked on ship, and are holding on to
   the cable, attached to some rock, we do not draw the rock to us, but
   ourselves, and the ship, to the rock. Wherefore, before everything, and
   especially theology, we must begin with prayer; not as though we
   ourselves were drawing the power, which is everywhere, and nowhere
   present, but as, by our godly reminiscences and invocations, conducting
   ourselves to, and making ourselves one with It."

   Origen confessed that Pantaenus was his superior in the philosophy of
   the schools, and that he moulded his teaching upon the model of
   Pantaenus. Do the writings of Origen bear the stamp of Dionysius and
   Hierotheus? Origen, on the resurrection of the body, says, "For how
   does it not seem absurd that this body which has endured scars for
   Christ, and, equally with the soul, has borne the savage torments of
   persecutions, and has also endured the suffering of chains, and rods,
   and has been tortured with fire, beaten with the sword, and has further
   suffered the cruel teeth of wild beasts, the gallows of the cross, and
   divers kinds of punishments,--that this should be deprived of the
   prizes of such contests. If forsooth, the soul alone, which not alone
   contended, should receive the crown, and its companion the body, which
   served it with much labour, should attain no recompense, for its agony
   and victory,--how does it not seem contrary to all reason, that the
   flesh, resisting for Christ its natural vices, and its innate lust, and
   guarding its virginity with immense labour,--that one, when the time
   for rewards has come, should be rejected as unworthy and the other
   should receive its crown? Such a fact would undoubtedly argue on the
   part of God, either a lack of justice or a lack of power." Dionysius
   (E. H., c. VII.) says, "Now the pure bodies of the holy souls, enrolled
   together as yoke-fellows, and fellow travellers, which together strove
   during the divine contests, throughout the Divine Life, in the unmoved
   steadfastness of the souls, will together receive their own
   resurrection. For, having been made one with the holy souls, to which
   they were united during this present life, by having become members of
   Christ, they will receive in return the godlike and incorruptible
   immortality and blessed inheritance." Dionysius (D. N., c. VI. s. 2)
   says, "what is still more divine, It promises to "transfer our whole
   selves (I mean souls and bodies, their yoke-fellows), to a perfect life
   and immortality. Others again do this injustice to bodies, that, after
   having toiled with the holy souls, they unjustly deprive them of the
   holy retributions, when they have come to the goal of their most divine
   course." "For if the man have passed a life dear to God in soul and
   body, the body which has contended throughout the Divine struggles will
   be honoured together with the devout soul."

   To shew that Origen knew the works of Hierotheus, we give an extract
   from his letter to Gregory: "Would that you might both participate in
   and continually augment this part, so that you may not only say, we are
   partakers of Christ,' but also partakers of God." Papias [148] , Bishop
   of Hierapolis (fragment V.) says, "the Presbyters, the disciples of the
   Apostles, say that this is the gradation and method of those who are
   saved, and that they advance through steps of this nature, and that,
   moreover, they ascend through the Spirit to the Son, and through the
   Son to the Father; and that, in due time, the Son will yield up His
   work to the Father." Who the Presbyters, the disciples of the Apostles
   were, we may gather from the three last chapters of the "Book of
   Hierotheus [149] ," in which the very same doctrine is taught. Is it
   not, then, a legitimate inference, that when Photius says " that
   Pantaenus was a pupil of the Presbyters who had seen the Apostles," he
   designated Hierotheus and Dionysius the Areopagite, generally known
   under that title?

   Ammonius Saccus was born of Christian parents in Alexandria, and died
   in that city, a.d. 242.

   Anastasius Sinaita calls him "the Wise," and Hierocles, "the taught of
   God." Besides being famous for his expositions of Holy Scripture, he
   wrote the "Diatesseron," or "Harmony of the Gospels," contained in the
   Bib. Patrum. In a.d. 236, he wrote the agreement between Moses and
   Jesus. He was the great conciliator, who sought the good in every
   system, and to make all one in Christ. Pressensé beautifully describes
   him as a man who wished to believe and to know--to adore and to
   comprehend--to conciliate the Greek Philosophy with the Mysteries of
   the East. He wrote a commentary on the golden verses of Pythagoras,
   which Hierocles published, as well as reproduced his other works. The
   titles of his books, mentioned by Photius, such as "Providence" and
   "Free Will," recall those of the lost books of Dionysius, of which we
   have only a summary in his known works. (Cod. 251-214.)

   Ammonius was surnamed Saccus from having been a corn carrier. Virgil,
   Shakespere, Milton, were great geniuses in themselves, but when we know
   the sources from which they drew, we can better understand their
   achievements.

   Dionysius was indebted to Hierotheus--Ammonius drew from Dionysius.
   This we shall shew, not as we might, by his works as described by
   Photius, but from Plotinus, his disciple, in order that we may have the
   prevailing proof, to some minds, of testimony not necessarily
   Christian.

   Plotinus was born in Lycopolis, a.d. 205, and died in Campagna, a.d.
   270. At the age of 29, he began to search for truth, in the schools of
   Alexandria. He wandered from teacher to teacher, but could find no rest
   until he was persuaded to go and hear Ammonius-Saccus. After listening
   to him, he exclaimed, "This is what I sought."

   Plotinus remained under him eleven years, until the death of Ammonius,
   a.d. 242. In a.d. 244, Plotinus began to teach in Rome. Plotinus was
   not a refined scholar. Porphyry, therefore, committed his teaching to
   writing. Porphyry was regarded as the greatest enemy to the Christian
   Faith in the early centuries. Persecutors burned the bodies of
   Christians, but Porphyry sought to undermine their faith in the Holy
   Scriptures, by quibbles of unbelief, which have been revived to-day as
   "New Criticism." Porphyry wrote against the Holy Scriptures with a
   bitterness engendered by a conviction of their truth. Now, it is a
   startling fact, that though the teaching of Plotinus comes to us
   through Porphyry, there is not a word in the Enneades, in which the
   teaching of Plotinus is given, against the Christian Faith. It is true
   that Eutochius published another version of the teaching of Plotinus,
   on the ground that his teaching was coloured by Porphyry, but we prefer
   to rest our proof on Porphyry, as not being prejudiced in favour of the
   truth.

   Let us then first see what Plotinus teaches respecting the Holy
   Trinity. He says, "We need not go beyond the three Hypostaseis"
   (Persons). It is true that Plotinus presents that Trinity as "One,"
   "Mind," and "Soul," whereas Dionysius gives the formula "Father, Son,
   and Spirit." Occasionally Plotinus uses "Logos" instead of "Mind." But
   even this substitution of "One" for "Father" may be traced to
   Dionysius, who speaks of the Triad, enarchike and even enarchikon
   hupostaseon, "One springing." The "One" represents the Father. Plotinus
   says, "We may represent the first principle, One,' as source, which has
   no other origin than Itself, and which pours Itself in a multitude of
   streams without being diminished by what it gives." Dionysius speaks of
   the "Father" as sole source of Godhead, and says that "the Godhead is
   undiminished by the gifts imparted." In Chap. XII. of Divine Names,
   Dionysius treats of "One" and "Perfect" as applied to Almighty God.

   Let Us now hear Plotinus on the "Beautiful" Enneades (I. 6-7). Plotinus
   says, "The soul advances in its ascent towards God, until being raised
   above everything alien, it sees face to face, in His simplicity, and in
   all His purity, Him upon Whom all hangs, to Whom all aspire; from Whom
   all hold existence, life and thought. What transport of love must not
   he feel who sees Him! with what ardour ought he not to desire to be
   united to Him! He, who has not seen Him, desires Him as the Good; he
   who has seen Him, admires Him as the sovereign Beauty; and struck at
   once with astonishment and pleasure, disdains the things which
   heretofore he called by the name of Beauty. This is what happens to
   those to whom have appeared the forms of gods and demons;--they no
   longer care For the beauty of other bodies. What think you, then,
   should he experience who has seen the Beautiful Himself,--the Beautiful
   surpassing earth and heaven! The miserable is not he, Who has neither
   fresh colour nor comely form, nor power, nor royalty; it is alone he,
   Who sees himself excluded from the possession of Beauty--a possession
   in comparison with which he ought to disdain royalty, rule of the whole
   earth, of the sea, and heaven itself, if he should be able, by
   abandoning, by despising all these, to rise to the contemplation of the
   Beautiful, face to face." Plotinus also recognised, "that the eye
   soiled with impurity could never bear the sight, or attain to the
   vision of that Beauty. We must render the organs of vision analogous
   and like to the object that they would contemplate. Every man ought to
   begin by rendering himself beautiful and divine to obtain a Vision of
   the Beautiful and the Deity." Well might St. Augustine say, that "with
   the change of a few words, Plotinus became concordant with Christ's
   religion." No wonder that Gregory and Basil quoted so largely from
   Plotinus. Let us now hear what Dionysius says of the "Good and
   Beautiful":-- "Goodness turns all things to Itself; all things aspire
   to It, as source and bond and end. From this Beautiful comes being to
   all existing things. All things aspire to the Beautiful and Good,--and
   there is no existing thing which does not participate in the Beautiful
   and Good." Read the Fourth Chapter of the Divine Names.

   Porphyry records that Plotinus attained to that vision of the Beautiful
   three times during his life. How that vision of the Beautiful is to be
   attained, Dionysius describes in the "Mystic Theology:"--"But thou, O
   dear Timothy, by thy persistent commerce with the mystic visions, leave
   behind both sensible perceptions and intellectual efforts, and all
   objects of sense and intelligence, and all things not being and being,
   and be raised aloft agnostically to the union, as attainable, with Him
   Who is above every essence and knowledge. For by unchecked and absolute
   extasy, in all purity, from thyself, and all, thou wilt be carried on
   high to the superessential Ray of the Divine Darkness, when thou hast
   cast away all and become free from all." Ammonius had such extasy
   during his lectures, in which he seemed to have Divine visions.

   Plotinus differs from Dionysius in regarding creation as an act of
   necessity, whereas Dionysius regards it as an act of love. Plotinus
   treats evil as "an elongation from God." Dionysius speaks of Almighty
   God as immanent in matter the most elongated from spirit. Plotinus
   traces evil to matter; Dionysius to the fallacious choice of a free
   agent. May it not be that the pagan colouring of Porphyry in these
   respects led Eutochius to give a more faithful and consistent account
   of the teaching of Plotinus.

   But the crowning proof that Dionysius was the source from which the
   Alexandrine School drew much of its wisdom, is Proclus (450-485).
   Suidas affirmed long ago that Proclus cribbed whole passages from
   Dionysius. Professor Stiglmayr fills seven pages with parallel
   passages.

   Vachérot describes certain chapters of the "Divine Names" as extracts
   from Proclus, word for word, and says the whole doctrine of Dionysius
   seems to be a commentary upon the Theology of Alexandria. Barthélémy
   St. Hilaire says that Dionysius and Scotus Erigena, almost entirely
   implanted, in the middle age, the doctrine of Neo-Platonism. Matter is
   more profound; Professor Langen finds in Dionysius the "characteristics
   of Neo-Platonic speculation." The similarity of doctrine is denied by
   none. Which writings appeared first? that is the question.

   Dexter commemorates the "Divine Names" a.d. 98 [150] .

   Polycarp quotes Dionysius verbatim as "a certain one." Jerome quotes
   him as "quidam Graecorum." Dionysius of Alexandria (a.d. 250), writing
   to Sixtus II., declares that no one can intelligently doubt that the
   writings are those of Dionysius, the convert of St. Paul, Bishop of
   Athens. Tertullian, expresses the Agnosia "nihil scire omnia scire,"
   Origen quotes him by name. Theodore (a.d. 420) answers
   objections,--whom Photius approved. Gregory calls Dionysius "an ancient
   and venerable Father." The Second Council of Nicea quotes the very
   words, contained in the "Ecclesiastical Hierarchy," c. I. s. 4, as
   those of the great Dionysius. Bishop Pearson proves that the best
   judges in the sixth, fifth, fourth and third centuries regarded the
   writings as written: by Dionysius the Areopagite. German scholars
   to-day admit that the external testimony is in favour of their
   genuineness.

   Yet eccentric critics, on account of the precise theology, cannot
   believe that the works were written; by a learned Greek,--Chief of the
   Areopagus--who forsook all to follow Christ,--the convert and disciple
   of St.. Paul,--the familiar friend of St. John and other Apostles, to
   whom our Saviour revealed the mysteries of the Father; but those
   critics can believe that an unknown man, whose century no one can fix,
   and possibly a Syrian, may have gleaned from writers of the first four
   centuries these theological pearls expressed in Greek in a style unique
   and always like itself. They can, believe that the Author of these
   Divine writings, would incorporate, fictitious allusions to persons and
   events of the apostolic, age, to add lustre to incomparable works, and
   to impute them to another. They can believe that writings, so composed,
   were foisted upon a credulous Christendom, so that Dionysius of
   Alexandria, Maximus, St. John Damascene, and the Council of Nicea,
   accepted them as the genuine works of Dipnysius. I do not belong to
   that school. Only unbelief could believe anything so incredible.
   Rational men will not hazard the surmise that works known in the first
   century were gleaned from writings composed four hundred years
   afterwards.

   The tone of the Alexandrine School may be further illustrated from
   Amelius and Dionysius the Sublime. Amelius attended Plotinus
   twenty-four years as companion and pupil. Eusebius gives an extract
   from his writings, in which Amelius says, "This plainly was the Word,
   by Whom, being Eternal, things becoming became, as Heraclitus would
   say." It was probably he who said, "the Prologue of St. John's Gospel
   ought to be written in gold, and placed in the most conspicuous place
   in every church." De Civ. Dei, LX. c. 29. Dionysius, the famous
   secretary of Zenobia, attended the lectures of Ammonius-Saccus. He was
   the "arbiter" of all literary questions. He expresses his admiration,
   De sub. L. 9, of the diction of Moses in the description of the six
   days' creation, and numbers St. Paul amongst the most brilliant Greek
   orators, as a man who propounded a "dogma beyond demonstration."

   We claim that the testimony of these illustrious men, and the extracts
   from Pantaenus, Ammonius, and their disciples, justify the conclusion
   that the Alexandrine School was Biblical, Christian, and Philosophical,
   that its Philosophy was a Divine Philosophy of the Faith, not a pagan
   philosophy against the Faith, and that the main sources of its Divine
   Philosophy were the writings of Hierotheus and Dionysius, Bishops of
   Athens.

  CAPUT I.

   To my Fellow Presbyter Timothy. [151] Dionysius the Presbyter.

   That every divine illumination, whilst going forth lovingly to the
   objects of its forethought under various forms, remains simplex. Nor is
   this all. It also unifies the things illuminated.

   Section I.

   "Every good gift [152] and every perfect gift is from above, and cometh
   down from the Father of Lights."

   Further also, every procession of illuminating light, proceeding from
   the Father, whilst visiting us as a gift of goodness, restores us again
   gradually as an unifying power, and turns us to the oneness of our
   conducting Father, and to a deifying simplicity. For [153] all things
   are from Him, and to Him, as said the Sacred Word.

   Section II.

   Invoking then Jesus, the Paternal Light, the Real, the True, "which
   lighteth [154] every man coming into the world," "through [155] Whom we
   have access to the Father," Source of Light, let us aspire, as far as
   is attainable, to the illuminations handed down by our fathers in the
   most sacred Oracles, and let us gaze, as we may, upon the Hierarchies
   of the Heavenly Minds manifested by them symbolically for our
   instruction. And when we have received, with immaterial and unflinching
   mental [156] eyes, the gift of Light, primal and super-primal, of the
   supremely Divine Father, which manifests to us the most blessed
   Hierarchies of the Angels in types and symbols, let us then, from it,
   be elevated to its simple splendour [157] . For it never loses its own
   unique inwardness, but multiplied and going forth, as becomes its
   goodness, for an elevating and unifying blending of the objects of its
   care, remains firmly and solitarily centred within itself in its
   unmoved sameness; and raises, according to their capacity, those who
   lawfully aspire to it, and makes them one, after the example of its own
   unifying Oneness. For it is not possible that the supremely Divine Ray
   should otherwise illuminate us, except so far as it is enveloped, for
   the purpose of instruction, in variegated sacred veils, and arranged
   naturally and appropriately, for such as we are, by paternal
   forethought.

   Section III.

   Wherefore, the Divine Institution of sacred Rites, having deemed it
   worthy of the supermundane imitation of the Heavenly Hierarchies, and
   having depicted the aforesaid immaterial Hierarchies in material
   figures and bodily compositions, in order that we might be borne, as
   far as our capacity permits, from the most sacred pictures to the
   instructions and similitudes without symbol and without type,
   transmitted to us our most Holy Hierarchy. For it is not possible for
   our mind to be raised to that immaterial representation and
   contemplation of the Heavenly Hierarchies, without using the material
   guidance suitable to itself, accounting the visiblePs. xix. beauties as
   reflections of the invisible comeliness; and the sweet [158] odours of
   the senses as emblems of the spiritual distribution; and the material
   [159] lights as a likeness of the gift of the immaterial enlightenment;
   and the detailed sacred instructions [160] , of the feast of
   contemplation within the mind; and the ranks [161] of the orders here,
   of the harmonious and regulated habit, with regard to Divine things;
   and the reception of the most Divine Eucharist, of the partaking [162]
   of Jesus, and whatever other things were transmitted to Heavenly Beings
   supermundanely, but to us symbolically.

   For the sake, then, of this our proportioned deification, the
   philanthropic Source of sacred mysteries, by manifesting the Heavenly
   Hierarchies to us, and constituting our Hierarchy as fellow-ministers
   with them, through our imitation of their Godlike priestliness [163] ,
   so far as in us lies, described under sensible likeness the
   supercelestial Minds, in the inspired compositions of the Oracles, in
   order that It might lead us through the sensible to the intelligible
   [164] , and from inspired symbols to the simple sublimities of the
   Heavenly Hierarchies.

  CAPUT II.

   That Divine and Heavenly things are appropriately revealed, even
   through dissimilar symbols.

   Section I.

   It is necessary then, as I think, first to set forth what we think is
   the purpose of every Hierarchy, and what benefit each one confers upon
   its followers; and next to celebrate the Heavenly Hierarchies according
   to their revelation in the Oracles; then following these Oracles, to
   say in what sacred forms the holy writings of the Oracles depict the
   celestial orders, and to what sort of simplicity we must be carried
   through the representations; in order that we also may not, like the
   vulgar, irreverently think that the heavenly and Godlike minds are
   certain many-footed [165] and many-faced [166] creatures, or moulded to
   the brutishness of oxen [167] , or the savage form of lionsIbid., and
   fashioned like the hooked beaks of eaglesIbid., or the feathery down of
   birds [168] , and should imagine that there are certain wheels [169] of
   fire above the heaven, or material thrones [170] upon which the Godhead
   may recline, or certain many-coloured [171] horses, and spear-bearing
   leaders of the host [172] , and whatever else was transmitted by the
   Oracles to us under multifarious symbols of sacred imagery.

   And indeed, the Word of God [173] artlessly makes use of poetic
   representations of sacred things, respecting the shapeless minds, out
   of regard to our intelligence, so to speak, consulting a mode of
   education proper and natural to it, and moulding the inspired writings
   for it.

   Section II.

   But if any one think well to accept the sacred compositions as of
   things simple and unknown in their own nature, and beyond our
   contemplation, but thinks the imagery of the holy minds in the Oracles
   is incongruous, and that all this is, so to speak, a rude scenic
   representation of the angelic names; and further says that the
   theologians ought, when they have come to the bodily representation of
   creatures altogether without body, to represent and display them by
   appropriate and, as far as possible, cognate figures, taken, at any
   rate, from our most honoured and immaterial and exalted beings, and
   ought not to clothe the heavenly and Godlike simple essences with the
   many forms of the lowest creatures to be found on the earth (for the
   one would perhaps be more adapted to our instruction, and would not
   degrade the celestial explanations to incongruous dissimilitudes; but
   the other both does violence without authority to the Divine powers,
   and likewise leads astray our minds, through dwelling upon these
   irreverent descriptions); and perhaps he will also think that the
   super-heavenly places are filled with certain herds of lions, and
   troops of horses, and bellowing songs of praise, and flocks of birds,
   and other living creatures, and material and less honourable things,
   and whatever else the similitudes of the Oracles, in every respect
   dissimilar, describe, for a so-called explanation, but which verge
   towards the absurd, and pernicious, and impassioned; now, in my
   opinion, the investigation of the truth demonstrates the most sacred
   wisdom of the Oracles, in the descriptions of the Heavenly Minds,
   taking forethought, as that wisdom does, wholly for each, so as
   neither, as one may say, to do violence to the Divine Powers, nor at
   the same time to enthral us in the grovelling passions of the debased
   imagery. For any one might say that the cause why forms are naturally
   attributed to the formless, and shapes to the shapeless, is not alone
   our capacity which is unable immediately to elevate itself to the
   intelligible contemplations, and that it needs appropriate and cognate
   instructions which present images, suitable to us, of the formless and
   supernatural objects of contemplation; but further, that it is most
   agreeable to the revealing Oracles to conceal, through mystical and
   sacred enigmas, and to keep the holy and secret truth respecting the
   supermundane minds inaccessible to the multitude. For it is not every
   one that is holy, nor, as the Oracles affirm, does knowledge belong to
   all [174] .

   Section III.

   But if any one should blame the descriptions as being incongruous, by
   saying that it is shameful to attribute shapes so repugnant to the
   Godlike and most holy Orders, it is enough to reply that the method of
   Divine revelation is twofold; one, indeed, as is natural, proceeding
   through likenesses that are similar, and of a sacred character, but the
   other, through dissimilar forms, fashioning them into entire unlikeness
   and incongruity. No doubt, the mystical traditions of the revealing
   Oracles sometimes extol the august Blessedness of the super-essential
   Godhead, as Word [175] , and Mind [176] , and Essence [177] ,
   manifesting its God-becoming expression and wisdom, both as really
   being Origin, and true Cause of the origin of things being, and they
   describe It as light [178] , and call it life. While such sacred
   descriptions are more reverent, and seem in a certain way to be
   superior to the material images, they yet, even thus, in reality fall
   short of the supremely Divine similitude. For It is above every essence
   and life. No light, indeed, expresses its character, and every
   description and mind incomparably fall short of Its similitude.

   But at other times its praises are supermundanely sung, by the Oracles
   themselves, through dissimilar revelations, when they affirm that it is
   invisible [179] , and infinite [180] , and incomprehensible [181] ; and
   when there is signified, not what it is, but what it is not. For this,
   as I think, is more appropriate to It, since, as the secret and
   sacerdotal tradition taught, we rightly describe its non-relationship
   to things created, but we do not know its superessential, and
   inconceivable, and unutterable indefinability. If, then, the negations
   respecting things Divine are true, but the affirmations are
   inharmonious, the revelation as regards things invisible, through
   dissimilar representations, is more appropriate to the hiddenness of
   things unutterable. Thus the sacred descriptions of the Oracles honour,
   and do not expose to shame, the Heavenly Orders, when they make them
   known by dissimilar pictorial forms, and demonstrate through these
   their supermundane superiority over all. material things. And I do not
   suppose that any sensible man will gainsay that the incongruous elevate
   our mind more than the similitudes; for there is a likelihood, with
   regard to the more sublime representations of heavenly things, that we
   should be led astray, so as to think that the Heavenly Beings are
   certain creatures with the appearance of gold, and certain men with the
   appearance of light [182] , and glittering like lightning [183] ,
   handsome [184] , clothed in bright shining raiment, shedding forth
   innocuous flame, and so with regard to all the other shapes and
   appropriate forms, with which the Word of God has depicted the Heavenly
   Minds. In order that men might not suffer from this, by thinking they
   are nothing more exalted than their beau tiful appearance, the
   elevating wisdom of the pious theologians reverently conducts to the
   incongruous dissimilarities, not permitting our earthly part to rest
   fixed in the base images, but urging the upward tendency of the soul,
   and goading it by the unseemliness of the phrases (to see) that it
   belongs neither to lawful nor seeming truth, even for the most earthly
   conceptions, that the most heavenly and Divine visions are actually
   like things so base. Further also this must particularly be borne in
   mind, that not even one of the things existing is altogether deprived
   of participation in the beautiful, since, as is evident and the truth
   of the Oracles affirms, all things are very beautiful [185] .

   Section IV.

   It is, then, possible to frame in one's mind good contemplations from
   everything, and to depict, from things material, the aforesaid
   dissimilar similitudes, both for the intelligible and the intelligent;
   since the intelligent hold in a different fashion things which are
   attributed to things sensible differently. For instance, appetite, in
   the irrational creatures, takes its rise in the passions, and their
   movement, which takes the form of appetite, is full of all kinds of
   unreasonableness. But with regard to the intelligent, we must think of
   the appetite in another fashion, as denoting, according to my judgment,
   their manly style, and their determined persistence in their Godlike
   and unchangeable steadfastness. In like manner we say, with regard to
   the irrational creatures, that lust is a certain uncircumspect and
   earthly passionate attachment, arising incontinently from an innate
   movement, or intimacy in things subject to change, and the irrational
   supremacy of the bodily desire, which drives the whole organism towards
   the object of sensual inclination. But when we attribute "lust" to
   spiritual beings, by clothing them with dissimilar similitudes, we must
   think that it is a Divine love of the immaterial, above expression and
   thought, and the inflexible and determined longing for the supernally
   pure and passionless contemplation, and for the really perpetual and
   intelligible fellowship in that pure and most exalted splendour, and in
   the abiding and beautifying comeliness. And 'incontinence' we may take
   for the persistent and inflexible, which nothing can repulse, on
   account of the pure and changeless love for the Divine beauty, and the
   whole tendency towards the really desired. But with regard to the
   irrational living beings, or soulless matter, we appropriately call
   their irrationality and want of sensible perception a deprivation of
   reason and sensible perception. And with regard to the immaterial and
   intelligent beings, we reverently acknowledge their superiority, as
   supermundane beings, over our discursive and bodily reason, and the
   material perception of the senses which is alien to the incorporeal
   Minds. It is, then, permissible to depict forms, which are not
   discordant, to the celestial beings, even from portions of matter which
   are the least honourable, since even it, having had its beginning from
   the Essentially Beautiful, has throughout the whole range of matter
   some echoes of the intellectual comeliness; and it is possible through
   these to be led to the immaterial archetypes--things most similar being
   taken, as has been said, dissimilarly, and the identities being denned,
   not in the same way, but harmoniously, and appropriately, as regards
   the intellectual and sensible beings.

   Section V.

   We shall find the Mystic Theologians enfolding these things not only
   around the illustrations of the Heavenly Orders, but also, sometimes,
   around the supremely Divine Revelations Themselves. At one time,
   indeed, they extol It under exalted imagery as Sun [186] of
   Righteousness, as Morning [187] Star rising divinely in the mind, and
   as Light [188] illuming without veil and for contemplation; and at
   other times, through things in our midst, as Fire [189] , shedding its
   innocuous light; as Water [190] , furnishing a fulness of life, and, to
   speak symbolically, flowing into a belly, and bubbling forth rivers
   flowing irresistibly; and at other times, from things most remote, as
   sweet-smelling ointment [191] , as Head Corner-stone [192] . But they
   also clothe It in forms of wild beasts, and attach to It identity with
   a Lion [193] , and Panther [194] , and say that it shall be a Leopard
   [195] , and a rushing BearIbid.. But, I will also add, that which seems
   to be more dishonourable than all, and the most incongruous, viz. that
   distinguished theologians have shewn it to us as representing Itself
   under the form of a worm [196] . Thus do all the godly-wise, and
   interpreters of the secret inspiration, separate the holy of holies
   [197] from the uninitiated and the unholy, to keep them undefined, and
   prefer the dissimilar description of holy things, so that Divine things
   should neither be easily reached by the profane, nor those who
   diligently contemplate the Divine imagery rest in the types as though
   they were true; and so Divine things should be honoured by the true
   negations, and by comparisons with the lowest things, which are diverse
   from their proper resemblance. There is then nothing absurd if they
   depict even the Heavenly Beings under incongruous dissimilar
   similitudes, for causes aforesaid. For probably not even we should have
   come to an investigation, from not seeing our way,--not to say to
   mystic meaning through an accurate enquiry into Divine things,--unless
   the deformity of the descriptions representing the Angels had shocked
   us, not permitting our mind to linger in the discordant
   representations, but rousing us utterly to reject the earthly
   proclivities, and accustoming us to elevate ourselves through things
   that are seen, to their supermundane mystical meanings. Let these
   things suffice to have been said on account of the material and
   incongruous descriptions of the holy Angels in the Holy Oracles. And
   next, it is necessary to define what we think the Hierarchy is in
   itself, and what benefit those who possess a Hierarchy derive; from the
   same. But let Christ lead the discourse--if it be lawful to me to
   say--He Who is mine,--the Inspiration of all Hierarchical revelation.
   And thou, my son, after the pious rule of our Hierarchical tradition,
   do thou religiously listen to things religiously uttered, becoming
   inspired through instruction in inspired things; and when thou hast
   enfolded the Divine things in the secret recesses of thy mind, guard
   them closely from the profane multitude as being uniform, for it is not
   lawful, as the Oracles say, to cast to swine the unsullied and bright
   and beautifying comeliness of the intelligible pearls.

  CAPUT III.

   What is Hierarchy? and what the use of Hierarchy?

   Section I.

   Hierarchy is, in my judgment, a sacred order and science and operation,
   assimilated, as far as attainable, to the likeness of God, and
   conducted to the illuminations granted to it from God, according to
   capacity, with a view to the Divine imitation. Now the God-becoming
   Beauty, as simple, as good, as source of initiation, is altogether free
   from any dissimilarity, and imparts its own proper light to each
   according to their fitness, and perfects in most Divine initiation, as
   becomes the undeviating moulding of those who are being initiated
   harmoniously to itself.

   Section II.

   The purpose, then, of Hierarchy is the assimilation and union, as far
   as attainable, with God, having Him Leader of all religious science and
   operation, by looking unflinchingly to His most Divine comeliness, and
   copying, as far as possible, and by perfecting its own followers as
   Divine images, mirrors most luminous and without flaw, receptive of the
   primal light and the supremely Divine ray, and devoutly filled with the
   entrusted radiance, and again, spreading this radiance ungrudgingly to
   those after it, in accordance with the supremely Divine regulations.
   For it is not lawful for the Mystic Rites of sacred things, or for
   things religiously done, to practise anything whatever beyond the
   sacred regulations of their own proper function. Nor even must they
   attempt otherwise, if they desire to attain its deifying splendour, and
   look to it religiously, and are moulded after the example of each of
   the holy minds. He, then, who mentions Hierarchy, denotes a certain
   altogether Holy Order, an image of the supremely Divine freshness,
   ministering the mysteries of its own illumination in hierarchical
   ranks, and sciences, and assimilated to its own proper Head as far as
   lawful.

   For each of those who have been called into the Hierarchy, find their
   perfection in being carried to the Divine imitation [198] in their own
   proper degree; and, what is more Divine than all, in becoming a
   fellow-worker [199] with God, as the Oracles say, and in shewing the
   Divine energy in himself manifested as far as possible. For it is an
   Hierarchical regulation that some are purified and that others purify
   [200] ; that some are enlightened and others enlighten [201] ; that
   some are perfected and others perfect; the Divine imitation will fit
   each one in this fashion. The Divine blessedness, to speak after the
   manner of men, is indeed unstained by any dissimilarity [202] , and is
   full of invisible light [203] --perfect [204] , and needing no
   perfection; cleansing, illuminating, and perfecting, yea, rather a holy
   purification, and illumination, and perfection--above purification,
   above light, preeminently perfect, self-perfect source and cause of
   every Hierarchy, and elevated pre-eminently above every holy thing.

   Section III.

   It is necessary then, as I think, that those who are being purified
   should be entirely perfected, without stain, and be freed from all
   dissimilar confusion; that those who are being illuminated should be
   filled with the Divine Light, conducted to the habit and faculty of
   contemplation in all purity of mind; that those who are being initiated
   should be separated from the imperfect, and become recipients of that
   perfecting science of the sacred things contemplated. Further, that
   those who purify should impart, from their own abundance of purity,
   their own proper holiness; that those who illuminate, as being more
   luminous intelligences, whose function it is to- receive and to impart
   light, and who are joyfully filled with holy gladness, that these
   should overflow, in proportion to their own overflowing light, towards
   those who are worthy of enlightenment; and that those who make perfect,
   as being skilled in the impartation of perfection, should perfect those
   being perfected, through the holy instruction, in the science of the
   holy things contemplated. Thus each rank of the Hierarchical Order is
   led, in its own degree, to the Divine co-operation, by performing,
   through grace and God-given power, those things which are naturally and
   supernaturally in the Godhead, and accomplished by It superessentially,
   and manifested hierarchically, for the attainable imitation of the
   God-loving Minds [205] .

     __________________________________________________________________

  CAPUT IV.

   What is meant by the appellation "Angels?"

   Section I.

   Now that the Hierarchy itself has been, in my judgment, sufficiently
   defined, we must next extol the Angelic Hierarchy, and we must
   contemplate, with supermundane eyes, its sacred formations, depicted in
   the Oracles, in order that we may be borne aloft to their Divinely
   resplendent simplicity, through the mystic representations, and may
   extol the source of all Hierarchical science with God-becoming
   reverence and with thanksgivings. First of all, however, let this truth
   be spoken --that it was through goodness that the superessential
   Godhead, having fixed all the essences of things being, brought them
   into being. For this is the peculiar characteristic of the Cause of all
   things, and of goodness surpassing all, to call things being to
   participation of Itself, as each order of things being was determined
   from its own analogy. For all things being share in a Providence, which
   bubbles forth from the superessential Deity, Cause of all things. For
   they would not be, unless they had participated in the Essence and
   Origin of things being. All things then, without life, participate in
   It by their being. For the being of all things is the Deity, above
   being; things living participate in its life-giving power, above all
   life; things rational and intellectual participate in its self-perfect
   and preeminently perfect wisdom, above all reason and mind. It is
   evident, then, that all those Beings are around It, which have
   participated in It, in many forms.

   Section II.

   The holy orders, then, of the Heavenly Beings share in the supremely
   Divine participation, in a higher degree than things which merely
   exist, or which lead an irrational life, or which are rational like
   ourselves. For by moulding themselves intelligibly to the Divine
   imitation, and looking supermundanely to the supremely Divine likeness,
   and striving to mould their intellectual appearance, they naturally
   have more ungrudging communications with It, being near and ever moving
   upwards, as far as lawful, elevating themselves with the intensity of
   the Divine unswerving love, and receiving the primal illuminations
   without earthly stain, and ranging themselves to these, and having
   their whole life intellectual. These, then, are they who, at first
   hand, and under many forms, participate in the Divine, and, at first
   hand, and under many forms, make known the supremely Divine Hiddenness.
   Wherefore, beyond all, they are deemed pre-eminently worthy of the
   appellation Angelic, on the ground that the supremely Divine
   illumination comes to them at first hand, and, through them, there pass
   to us manifestations above us. Thus, then, the Law, as the Word of God
   affirms, was given to us through the ministration of Angels [206] ; and
   Angels led our illustrious fathers [207] before the Law, and after the
   Law, to the Divine Being, either by leading [208] them to what was to
   be done, and by converting them from error, and an unholy life, to the
   straight way of truth [209] , or by making known to them sacred
   ordinances [210] , or hidden visions, or supermundane mysteries [211] ,
   or certain Divine predictions through the Prophets [212] .

   Section III.

   But if any one should say that Divine manifestations were made directly
   and immediately to some holy men [213] , let him learn, and that
   distinctly, from the most Holy Oracles, that no one hath seen, nor ever
   shall see, the "hidden" to kruphion of Almighty God as it is in itself
   [214] . Now Divine manifestations were made to the pious as befits
   revelations of God, that is to say, through certain holy visions
   analogous to those who see them. Now the all-wise Word of God
   (Theologia) naturally calls Theophany that particular vision which
   manifests the Divine similitude depicted in itself as in a shaping of
   the shapeless, from the elevation of the beholders to the Divine Being,
   since through it a divine illumination comes to the beholders, and the
   divine persons themselves are religiously initiated into some mystery.
   But our illustrious fathers were initiated into these Divine visions,
   through the mediation of the Heavenly Powers. Does not the tradition of
   the Oracles describe the holy legislation of the Law, given to Moses,
   as coming straight from God, in order that it may teach us this truth,
   that it is an outline of a Divine and holy legislation? But the Word of
   God, in its Wisdom, teaches this also--that it came to us through
   Angels, as though the Divine regulation were laying down this rule,
   that, through the first, the second are brought to the Divine Being.
   For not only with regard to the superior and inferior minds, but even
   for those of the same rank, this Law has been established by the
   superessential supreme ordinance, that, within each Hierarchy, there
   are first, and middle, and last ranks and powers, and that the more
   divine are instructors and conductors of the less, to the Divine
   access, and illumination, and participation.

   Section IV.

   But I observe that Angels first were initiated in the Divine mystery of
   the love of Jesus towards man, then, through them, the gift of its
   knowledge passed to us. Thus, for example, the most divine Gabriel
   instructed Zachariah, the Hierarch, that the son who was to be born to
   him, beyond hope, by Divine grace, should be a prophet of the
   God-incarnate work of the Lord Jesus, to be manifested to the world for
   its salvation, as becomes the Divine goodness; and he revealed to Mary,
   how, in her, should be born the supremely Divine mystery of the
   unutterable God-formation. Yet another Angel instructed Joseph, how, in
   very truth, should be fulfilled the things Divinely promised to his
   ancestor David. Another declared glad tidings to the shepherds, as
   being purified by their separation from the multitude, and their quiet
   life, and, with him, a multitude of the Heavenly Host announced to
   those on earth that often-sung doxology. Let us then ascend to the
   highest manifestations of light contained in the Oracles, for I
   perceive that even Jesus Himself, the superessential Cause of the
   super-heavenly Beings, when He had come to our condition, without
   change, did not overstep the good order which becomes mankind, which
   Himself arranged and took, but readily subjected Himself to the
   dispositions of the Father and God, through Angels; and, through their
   mediation, was announced to Joseph the departure of the Son to Egypt,
   which had been arranged by the Father, and again the return to Judaea
   from Egypt. And through Angels we see Him subjecting Himself to the
   Father's decrees. For I forbear to speak, as addressing one who knows
   the teaching of our hierarchical tradition, both concerning the Angel
   who strengthened the Lord Jesus, or that even Jesus Himself, when He
   had come to manifest the good work of our beneficent salvation, was
   called Angel of Great Counsel. For, as He Himself says, after the
   manner of an Angel, "Whatsoever He heard from the Father, He announced
   to us."

  CAPUT V.

   For what reason all the Heavenly Beings are called, in common, Angels.

   This, then, in our judgment, is the reason for the appellation Angelic
   in the Oracles. We must now, I suppose, enquire for what reason the
   theologians call all the Heavenly Beings together "Angels;" but when
   they come to a more accurate description of the supermundane orders,
   they name exclusively, "angelic rank," that which completes the full
   tale of the Divine and Heavenly Hosts. Before this, however, they range
   pre-eminently, the Orders of Archangels, and the Principalities, the
   Authorities, and Powers, and as many Beings as the revealing traditions
   of the Oracles recognize as superior to them. Now, we affirm that
   throughout every sacred ordinance the superior ranks possess the
   illuminations and powers of their subordinates, but the lowest have not
   the same powers as those who are above them. The theologians also call
   the most holy ranks of the highest Beings "Angels," for they "also make
   known the supremely Divine illumination. But there is no reason to call
   the lowest rank of the celestial Minds, Principalities, or Thrones, or
   Seraphim. For it does not possess the highest powers, but, as it
   conducts our inspired Hierarchs to the splendours of the Godhead known
   to it; so also, the saintly powers of the Beings above it are
   conductors, towards the Divine Being, of that Order which completes the
   Angelic Hierarchies. Except perhaps some one might say this also, that
   all the angelic appellations are common, as regards the subordinate and
   superior communication of all the celestial powers towards the Divine
   likeness, and the gift of light from God. But, in order that the
   question may be better investigated, let us reverently examine the
   saintly characteristics set forth respecting each celestial Order in
   the Oracles.
     __________________________________________________________________

  CAPUT VI.

   Which is the first Order of the Heavenly Beings? which the middle? and
   which the last?

   How many, and of what sort, are the Orders of the supercelestial
   Beings, and how the Hierarchies are classified amongst themselves, I
   affirm, the deifying Author of their consecration alone distinctly
   knows; and further, that they know their own proper powers and
   illuminations, and their sacred and supermundane regularity. For it is
   impossible that we should know the mysteries of the supercelestial
   Minds and their most holy perfections, except, some one might say, so
   far as the Godhead has revealed to us, through them, as knowing
   perfectly their own condition. We, then, will utter nothing as from
   ourselves, but whatever angelic visions have been gazed upon by the
   holy Prophets of God, we, as initiated in these, will set forth as best
   we can. The Word of God has designated the whole Heavenly Beings as
   nine, by appellations, which shew their functions. These our Divine
   Initiator divides into three threefold Orders. He also says that that
   which is always around God is first and is declared by tradition to be
   united closely and immediately, to Him, before all the rest. For he
   says that the teaching of the Holy Oracles declares, that the most Holy
   Thrones, and the many-eyed and many-winged hosts, named in the Hebrew
   tongue Cherubim and Seraphim, are established immediately around God,
   with a nearness superior to all. This threefold order, then, our
   illustrious Guide spoke of as one, and of equal rank, and really first
   Hierarchy, than which there is not another more Godlike or immediately
   nearer to the earliest illuminations of the Godhead. But he says, that
   which is composed of the Authorities, and Lordships, and Powers is
   second; and, as respects the lowest of the Heavenly Hierarchies, the
   Order of the Angels and Archangels and Principalities is third.
     __________________________________________________________________

  CAPUT VII.

   Concerning the Seraphim and Cherubim and Thrones, and concerning their
   first Hierarchy.

   Section I.

   We, whilst admitting this as the arrangement of the holy Hierarchies,
   affirm, that every appellation of the celestial Minds denotes the
   Godlike characteristic of each; and those who know Hebrew affirm, that
   the holy designation of the Seraphim denotes either that they are
   kindling or burning; and that of Cherubim, a fulness of knowledge or
   stream of wisdom. Naturally, then, the first (order) of the Heavenly
   Hierarchies is ministered by the most exalted Beings, holding, as it
   does, a rank which is higher than all, from the fact, that it is
   established immediately around God, and that the first-wrought Divine
   manifestations and perfections pass earlier to it, as being nearest.
   They are called, then, "Burning," and Thrones, and Stream of Wisdom--by
   a name which sets forth their Godlike conditions. The appellation of
   Seraphim plainly teaches their ever moving around things Divine, and
   constancy, and warmth, and keenness, and the seething of that
   persistent, indomitable, and inflexible perpetual motion, and the
   vigorous assimilation and elevation of the subordinate, as giving new
   life and rekindling them to the same heat; and purifying through fire
   and burnt-offering, and the light-like and light-shedding
   characteristic which can never be concealed or consumed, and remains
   always the same, which destroys and dispels every kind of obscure
   darkness. But the appellation of the Cherubim denotes their knowledge
   and their vision of God, and their readiness to receive the highest
   gift of light, and their power of contemplating the super-Divine
   comeliness in its first revealed power, and their being filled anew
   with the impartation which maketh wise, and their ungrudging
   communication to those next to them, by the stream of the given wisdom.
   The appellation of the most exalted and pre-eminent Thrones denotes
   their manifest exaltation above every grovelling inferiority, and their
   supermundane tendency towards higher things; and their unswerving
   separation from all remoteness; and their invariable and firmly-fixed
   settlement around the veritable Highest, with the whole force of their
   powers; and their receptivity of the supremely Divine approach, in the
   absence of all passion and earthly tendency, and their bearing God; and
   the ardent expansion of themselves for the Divine receptions.

   Section II.

   This, then, is the revelation of their names, so far as we can give it;
   and we ought to say what we think their Hierarchy is. For I suppose we
   have sufficiently shewn above, that the purpose of every Hierarchy is
   an unswerving devotion to the divine imitation of the Divine Likeness,
   and that every Hierarchical function is set apart for the sacred
   reception and distribution of an undefiled purification, and Divine
   Light, and perfecting science.

   And now I pray that I may speak worthily of the most exalted Minds--how
   the Hierarchy amongst them is exhibited through the Oracles.

   One must consider, then, that the Hierarchy is akin, and in every
   respect like, to the first Beings, who are established after the
   Godhead, who gave them Being, and who are marshalled, as it were, in
   Its very vestibule, who surpass every unseen and seen created power. We
   must then regard them as pure, not as though they had been freed from
   unholy stains and blemishes, nor yet as though they were unreceptive of
   earthly fancies, but as far exalted above every stain of remissness and
   every inferior holiness, as befits the highest degree of
   purity--established above the most Godlike powers, and clinging
   unflinchingly to their own self-moved and same-moved rank in their
   invariable love of God, conscious in no respect whatever of any
   declivity to a worse condition, but having the unsullied fixity of
   their own Godlike identity--never liable to fall, and always unmoved;
   and again, as "contemplative," not contemplators of intellectual
   symbols as sensible, nor as being led to the Divine Being by the varied
   texture of holy representations written for meditation, but as being
   filled with all kinds of immaterial knowledge of higher light, and
   satiated, as permissible, with the beautifying and original beauty of
   super-essential and thrice manifested contemplation, and thus, being
   deemed worthy of the Communion with Jesus, they do not stamp
   pictorially the deifying similitude in divinely-formed images, but, as
   being really near to Him, in first participation of the knowledge of
   His deifying illuminations; nay more, that the imitation of God is
   given to them in the highest possible degree, and they participate, so
   far as is allowable to them, in His deifying and philanthropic virtues,
   in the power of a first manifestation; and, likewise as "perfected,"
   not as being illuminated with an analytic science of sacred variety,
   but as being filled with a first and pre-eminent deification, as
   beseems the most exalted science of the works of God, possible in
   Angels. For, not through other holy Beings, but being ministered from
   the very Godhead, by the immediate elevation to It, by their power, and
   rank, surpassing all, they are both established near the All-Holy
   without any shadow of turning, and are conducted for contemplation to
   the immaterial and intelligible comeliness, as far as permissible, and
   are initiated into the scientific methods of the works of God, as being
   first and around God, being ministered, in the highest degree, from the
   very source of consecration.

   Section III.

   This, then, the theologians distinctly shew (viz.) that the subordinate
   Orders of the Heavenly Beings are taught by the superior, in due order,
   the deifying sciences; and that those who are higher than all are
   illuminated from Godhead itself, as far as permissible, in revelations
   of the Divine mysteries. For they introduce some of them as being
   religiously instructed, by those of a higher rank, that He, Who was
   raised to Heaven as Man, is Lord of the Heavenly Powers and King of
   Glory; and others, as questioning Jesus Himself, as desiring to be
   instructed in the science of His Divine work on our behalf, and Jesus
   Himself teaching them immediately, and shewing to them, at first hand,
   His beneficent work out of love to man. For "I," He says, "am speaking
   of righteousness and judgment of Salvation." Now I am astonished that
   even the first of the Beings in Heaven, and so far above all, should
   reverently strive after the supremely Divine illuminations, as
   intermediate Beings. For they do not ask directly, "Wherefore are Thy
   garments red? " but they first raise the question among themselves,
   shewing that they desire to learn, and crave the deifying knowledge,
   and not anticipating the illumination given after a Divine procedure.

   The first Hierarchy, then, of the Heavenly Minds is purified, and
   enlightened, and perfected, by being ministered from the very Author of
   initiation, through its elevation to It immediately, being filled,
   according to its degree, with the altogether most holy purification of
   the unproachable Light of the pre-perfect source of initiation,
   unstained indeed by any remissness, and full of primal Light, and
   perfected by its participation in first-given knowledge and science.
   But to sum up, I may say this, not inappropriately, that the reception
   of the supremely Divine Science is, both purification, and
   enlightenment, and perfecting,--purifying, as it were, from ignorance,
   by the knowledge of the more perfect revelations imparted to it
   according to fitness, and enlightening by the self-same Divine
   knowledge, through which it also purifies, that which did not before
   contemplate the things which are now made manifest through the higher
   illumination; and perfecting further, by the self-same Light, through
   the abiding science of the mysteries made clearly manifest.

   Section IV.

   This, then, according to my science, is the first rank of the Heavenly
   Beings which encircle and stand immediately around God; and without
   symbol, and without interruption, dances round His eternal knowledge in
   the most exalted ever-moving stability as in Angels; viewing purely
   many and blessed contemplations, and illuminated with simple and
   immediate splendours, and filled with Divine nourishment,--many indeed
   by the first-given profusion, but one by the unvariegated and unifying
   oneness of the supremely Divine banquet, deemed worthy indeed of much
   participation and co-operation with God, by their assimilation to Him,
   as far as attainable, of their excellent habits and energies, and
   knowing many Divine things pre-eminently, and participating in
   supremely Divine science and knowledge, as is lawful. Wherefore the
   Word of God has transmitted its hymns to those on earth, in which are
   Divinely shewn the excellency of its most exalted illumination. For
   some of its members, to speak after sensible perception, proclaim as a
   "voice of many waters," "Blessed is the glory of the Lord from His
   place" and others cry aloud that frequent and most august hymn of God,
   "Holy, Holy, Holy, Lord of Sabaoth, the whole earth is full of His
   glory." These most excellent hymnologies of the supercelestial Minds we
   have already unfolded to the best of our ability in the "Treatise
   concerning the Divine Hymns," and have spoken sufficiently concerning
   them in that Treatise, from which, by way of remembrance, it is enough
   to produce so much as is necessary to the present occasion, namely,
   "That the first Order, having been illuminated, from this the supremely
   Divine goodness, as permissible, in theological science, as a Hierarchy
   reflecting that Goodness transmitted to those next after it," teaching
   briefly this, "That it is just and right that the august Godhead --
   Itself both above praise, and all-praiseworthy--should be known and
   extolled by the God-receptive minds, as is attainable; for they as
   images of God are, as the Oracles say, the Divine places of the
   supremely Divine repose; and further, that It is Monad and Unit
   tri-subsistent, sending forth His most kindly forethought to all things
   being, from the super-heavenly Minds to the lowest of the earth; as
   super-original Origin and Cause of every essence, and grasping all
   things super-essentially in a resistless embrace.
     __________________________________________________________________

  CAPUT VIII.

   Concerning Lordships and Powers and Authorities, and concerning their
   middle Hierarchy.

   Section I.

   Let us now pass to the middle Order of the Heavenly Minds, gazing, as
   far as we may, with supermundane eyes upon those Lordships, and the
   truly terrible visions of the Divine Authorities and Powers. For each
   appellation of the Beings above us manifests their God-imitating
   characteristics of the Divine Likeness. I think, then, that the
   explanatory name of the Holy Lordships denotes a certain unslavish
   elevation, free from all grovelling subserviency, as becomes the free,
   not submitting itself in any way whatever to one of the tyrannical
   dissimilarities, as a cruel Lordship; superior to every kind of
   cringing slavery, indomitable to every subserviency, and elevated above
   every dissimilarity, ever aspiring to the true Lordship, and source of
   Lordship; and moulding, as an image of goodness, itself, and those
   after it, to its Lordly bearing, as attainable, turning itself wholly
   to none of the things that vainly seem, but to the Lordly Being, and
   ever sharing in the Lordly Likeness of God, to its utmost ability; and
   the appellation of the Holy Powers denotes a certain courageous and
   unflinching virility, for all those Godlike energies within them--not
   feebly weak for the reception of any of the Divine illuminations
   vouchsafed to it--vigorously conducted to the Divine imitation, not
   forsaking the Godlike movement through its own unmanliness, but
   unflinchingly looking to the superessential and powerful-making power,
   and becoming a powerlike image of this, as far as is attainable, and
   powerfully turned to this, as Source of Power, and issuing forth to
   those next in degree, in gift of Power, and in likeness to God; and
   that the appellation of the Holy Authorities, of the same rank as the
   Divine Lordships and Powers, (denotes) the beautiful and unconfused
   good order, with regard to the Divine receptions, and the discipline of
   the supermundane and intellectual authority, not using the
   authoritative powers imperiously for base purposes, but conducted
   indomitably, with good order, towards Divine things, and conducting
   those after it benignly, and assimilated, as far as permissible, to the
   Authoritative Source of authority, and making this visible, as is
   possible to Angels, in the well-ordered ranks of the authoritative
   power within it. The middle Order of the Heavenly Minds having these
   Godlike characteristics, is purified and illuminated and perfected in
   the manner described, by the Divine illuminations vouchsafed to it at
   second hand, through the first Hierarchical Order, and passing through
   this middle as a secondary manifestation.

   Section II.

   No doubt, as regards that message, which is said to pass through one
   angel to another, we may take it as a symbol of a perfecting completed
   from afar, and obscured by reason of its passage to the second rank.
   For, as men skilled in our sacred initiations say, the fulness of
   Divine things manifested directly to ourselves is more perfecting than
   the Divine contemplations imparted through others. Thus, I think, the
   immediate participation of the Angelic ranks elevated in first degree
   to God, is more clear than those perfected through the instrumentality
   of others. Wherefore by our sacerdotal tradition, the first Minds are
   named perfecting, and illuminating, and purifying Powers of the
   subordinate, who are conducted, through them, to the superessential
   Origin of all things, and participate, as far as is permissible to
   them, in the consecrating purifications, and illuminations, and
   perfections. For, this is divinely fixed absolutely by the Divine
   source of order that, through the first, the second partake of the
   supremely Divine illuminations. This you will find declared by the
   theologians in many ways. For, when the Divine and Paternal Love
   towards man whilst chastening, in a startling manner, His people
   Israel, for their religious preservation, after delivering them to
   terrible and savage nations for correction, by various leadings of His
   guided people to better things, both liberated them from their misery,
   and mildly led them back, through His compassion, to their former state
   of comfort; one of the theologians, Zechariah, sees one of the first
   Angels, as I think, and near God, (for the Angelic appellation is
   common, as I said, to them all), learning from God Himself the
   comforting words, as they are called, concerning this matter; and
   another Angel, of inferior rank, advancing to meet the first, as for
   reception and participation of enlightenment: then, by him instructed
   in the Divine purpose as from a Hierarch, and charged to reveal to the
   theologian that Jerusalem should be abundantly occupied by a multitude
   of people. And another theologian, Ezekiel, says that this was
   righteously ordained by the glorious Deity Itself, seated above the
   Cherubim. For Paternal Love towards man, conducting Israel as we have
   said through chastisement to better things, by a righteousness worthy
   of God, deemed right to separate the guilty from the guiltless. This is
   first revealed to one after the Cherubim; him who was bound about the
   loins with a sapphire, and wore displayed the robe coming down to the
   feet, as a Hierarchical symbol. But the Divine Government enjoins the
   other Angels, who bore the battle-axes, to be instructed from the
   former, as to the Divine judgment in this matter. For, to one, He said
   that he should go through the midst of Jerusalem, and place the sign
   upon the forehead of the innocent men, but to the others; "Go into the
   city after him and strike, and draw not back your eyes, but to every
   one upon whom is the sign draw not near."

   What would any one say concerning the Angel, who said to Daniel, "The
   word has gone forth?" or concerning him the first, who took the fire
   from the midst of the Cherubim, or what is more remarkable than this
   for shewing the good order amongst the Angels, that the Cherubim casts
   the fire into the hands of him who wears the sacred vestment; or
   concerning Him Who called the most divine Gabriel, and said to him,
   "Make this man understand the vision," or whatever else is recorded by
   the holy theologians concerning the Godlike order of the Heavenly
   Hierarchies; by being assimilated to which, as far as possible, the
   discipline of our Hierarchy will have the Angelic comeliness, as it
   were, in reflection, moulded through it, and conducted to the
   superessential Source of order in every Hierarchy.
     __________________________________________________________________

  CAPUT IX.

   Concerning the Principalities, Archangels, and Angels, and concerning
   their last Hierarchy.

   Section I.

   There remains for our reverent contemplation a Division which completes
   the Angelic Hierarchies, that divided into the Godlike Principalities,
   Archangels, and Angels. And I think it necessary, to declare first the
   meaning of their sacred appellations to the best of my ability. For
   that of the Heavenly Principalities manifests their princely and
   leading function, after the Divine example, with order religious and
   most befitting the Princely, and their being wholly turned to the
   super-princely Prince, and leading others in princely fashion, and
   being moulded, as far as possible, to that prince-making Princedom
   Itself, and to manifest its superessential princely order, by the
   regularity of the princely powers.

   Section II.

   The (Order) of the Holy Archangels is of the same rank with the
   heavenly Principalities. For there is one Hierarchy and Division, as I
   said, of them and the Angels. But since there is not a Hierarchy which
   does not possess first and middle and last powers, the holy order of
   Archangels occupies the middle position in the Hierarchy between the
   extremes, for it belongs alike to the most holy Principalities and to
   the holy Angels; to the Principalities because it is turned in a
   princely fashion to the superessential Princedom, and is moulded to It
   as far as attainable, and unites the Angels after the fashion of its
   own well-regulated and marshalled and invisible leadings; and it
   belongs to the Angels, because it is of the messenger Order, receiving
   hierarchically the Divine illuminations from the first powers, and
   announcing the same to the Angels in a godly manner, and, through
   Angels, manifesting to us, in proportion to the religious aptitude of
   each of the godly persons illuminated. For the Angels, as we have
   already said, complete the whole series of Heavenly Minds, as being the
   last Order of the Heavenly Beings who possess the Angelic
   characteristic; yea, rather, they are more properly named Angels by us
   than those of higher degree, because their Hierarchy is occupied with
   the more manifest, and is more particularly concerned with the things
   of the world. For the very highest Order, as being placed in the first
   rank near the Hidden One, we must consider as directing in spiritual
   things the second, hiddenly; and that the second, which is composed of
   the holy Lordships and Powers and Authorities, leads the Hierarchy of
   the Principalities and Archangels and Angels, more clearly indeed than
   the first Hierarchy, but more hiddenly than the Order after it, and the
   revealing order of the Principalities, Archangels, and Angels,
   presides, through each other, over the Hierarchies amongst men, in
   order that the elevation, and conversion, and communion, and union with
   God may be in due order; and, further, also that the procession from
   God vouchsafed benignly to all the Hierarchies, and passing to all in
   common, may be also with most sacred regularity. Hence, the Word of God
   has assigned our Hierarchy to Angels, by naming Michael as Ruler of the
   Jewish people, and others over other nations. For the Most High
   established borders of nations according to number of Angels of God.

   Section III.

   But if any one should say, "How then were the people of the Hebrews
   alone conducted to the supremely Divine illuminations?" we must answer,
   that we ought not to throw the blame of the other nations wandering
   after those which are no gods upon the direct guidance of the Angels,
   but that they themselves, by their own declension, fell away from the
   direct leading towards the Divine Being, through self-conceit and
   self-will, and through their irrational veneration for things which
   appeared to them worthy of God. Even the Hebrew people are said to have
   suffered the same thing; for He says, "Thou I hast cast away knowledge
   of God, and hast gone after thine own heart." For neither have we a
   life governed by necessity, nor on account of the free will of those
   who are objects of providential care, are the Divine rays of the
   providential illumination blunted; but the inaptitude of the mental
   visions makes the overflowing light-gift of the paternal goodness,
   either altogether unparticipated or inpenetrable to their resistance,
   or makes the participations of the one fontal ray, diverse, small, or
   great, obscure, or brilliant, although that ray is one and simple, and
   always the same and ever overflowing; for even if, over the other
   nations (from whom we also have emerged to that boundless and bounteous
   sea of Divine Light, which is readily-expanded for the ready reception
   of all), certain not alien gods were wont to preside; yet there is one
   Head of all, and to this, the Angels, who religiously direct each
   nation, conduct those who follow them. Let us consider Melchizedek as
   being a Hierarch, most dear to God; (not of gods which are not, but of
   the truly most high God); for the godly-wise did not call Melchizedek
   simply dear to God, but also Priest, in order that they may clearly
   shew to the wise, that not only was he himself turned to the true God,
   but further that he was guide to others, as Hierarch of the elevation
   to the true and only Godhead.

   Section IV.

   Let me also recall this to your Hierarchical judgment--that both to
   Pharaoh, from the Angel who presided over the Egyptians, and to the
   Babylonian Prince, from his own Angel, the watchful and ruling care of
   the Providence and Lordship over all, was interpreted in visions; and
   for those nations, the worshippers of the true God were appointed
   leaders, for the interpretation of things shaped by Angelic visions
   revealed from God through Angels to holy men akin to the Angels, Daniel
   and Joseph. For there is one Prince and Providence over all. And never
   must we think that the Godhead is leader of Jews by lot, and that
   Angels, independently, or as of equal rank, or in opposition, or that
   certain other gods, preside over the other nations. But that particular
   phrase of the Divine Word must be accepted according to the following
   sacred intention; not as though God had divided government amongst men,
   with other gods, or Angels, and had been elected by lot to the
   government and leadership of Israel, but in this sense--whilst the one
   Providence of Highest over all, assigned all mankind, savingly, to the
   directing conduct of their own Angels, yet Israel, almost alone in
   comparison with all, turned himself to the Light-gift, and recognition
   of the true Lord-Hence the Word of God, as shewing that Israel elected
   himself for the worship of the true God, says this, "He became Lord's
   portion;" and as indicating that he was assigned equally with the other
   nations, to one of the holy Angels, for the recognition, through him,
   of the Head of all, said "That Michael became leader of the (Jewish)
   people," demonstrating distinctly that there is one Providence of the
   whole, superessentially established above all the powers, unseen and
   seen, and that all the Angels who preside over each nation, elevate, as
   far as possible, those who follow them with a willing mind, to It as
   their proper Head.
     __________________________________________________________________

  CAPUT X.

   A Repetition and Summary of the Angelic discipline.

   Section I.

   We have concluded, then, that the most reverend Order of the Minds
   around God, ministered by the perfecting illumination through its
   immediate elevation to it, is purified, and illuminated, and perfected
   by a gift of light from the Godhead, more hidden and more
   manifest--more hidden, indeed, as being more intelligible, and more
   simplifying, and more unifying; more manifest, as being a first gift
   and a first manifestation, and more complete, and more affused to it as
   transparent. And from this (Order) again, in due degree, the second,
   and from the second, the third, and from the third, our Hierarchy, is
   reverently conducted to the super-original Origin and End of all good
   order, according to the self-same law of well-ordered regularity, in
   Divine harmony and proportion.

   Section II.

   Now all Angels are interpreters of those above them, the most reverend,
   indeed, of God, Who moves them, and the rest, in due degree, of those
   who have been moved by God. For, to such an extent has the
   superessential harmony of all things provided for the religious order
   and the regulated conduct of each of the rational and intellectual
   beings, that each rank of the Hierarchies, has been placed in sacred
   order, and we observe every Hierarchy distributed into first, and
   middle, and last Powers. But to speak accurately, He distinguished each
   Division itself, by the same Divine harmonies; wherefore the
   theologians say that the most Divine Seraphim cry one to another,
   indicating distinctly, as I think by this, that the first impart their
   knowledge of divine things to the second.

   Section III.

   I might add this not inappropriately, that each heavenly and human mind
   has within itself its own special first, and middle, and last ranks,
   and powers, manifested severally in due degree, for the aforesaid
   particular mystical meanings of the Hierarchical illuminations,
   according to which, each one participates-, so far as is lawful and
   attainable to him, in the most spotless purification, the most copious
   light, the pre-eminent perfection. For there is nothing that is
   self-perfect, or absolutely without need of perfecting, except the
   really Self-perfect and preeminently Perfect.

  CAPUT XI.

   For what reason all the Heavenly Beings, in common, are called Heavenly
   Powers.

   Section I.

   Now that we have defined these things, it is worthy of consideration
   for what reason we are accustomed to call all the Angelic Beings
   together, Heavenly Powers. For it is not possible to say, as we may of
   the Angels, that the Order of the holy Powers is last of all. The
   Orders of the superior Beings share in the saintly illumination. of the
   last; but the last in no wise of the first; and on this account all the
   Divine Minds are called Heavenly Powers, but never Seraphim and Thrones
   and Lordships. For the last do not enjoy the whole characteristics of
   the highest. For the Angels, and those above the Angels--Archangels,
   and Principalities, and Authorities,--placed by the Word of God after
   the Powers, are often in common called by us, in conjunction with the
   other holy Beings, Heavenly Powers.

   Section II.

   But we affirm that, whilst often using the appellation, Heavenly
   Powers, for all in common, we do not introduce a sort of. confusion of
   the characteristics of each Order. But, inasmuch as all the Divine
   Minds, by the supermundane description given of them, are distributed
   into three,--into essence, and power, and energy,--when we speak of
   them all, or some of them, indiscriminately, as Heavenly Beings or
   Heavenly Powers, we must consider that we manifest those about whom we
   speak in a general way, from their essence or power severally. For we
   must not apply the superior characteristic of those holy Powers, whom
   we have already sufficiently distinguished, to the Beings which are
   entirely inferior to them, so as to overthrow the unconfused order of
   the Angelic ranks. For according to the correct account which we have
   already frequently given, the superior Orders possess abundantly the
   sacred characteristics of the inferior, but the lowest do not possess
   the superior completeness of the more reverend, since the
   first-manifested illuminations are revealed to them, through the first
   Order, in proportion to their capacity.
     __________________________________________________________________

  CAPUT XII.

   Why the Hierarchs amongst men are called Angels.

   Section I.

   But this is sometimes also asked by diligent contemplators of the
   intelligible Oracles; Inasmuch as the lowest Orders do not possess the
   completeness of the superior, for what reason is our Hierarch named by
   the Oracles, "Angel of the Sovereign Lord?"

   Section II.

   Now the statement, as I think, is not contrary to what has been before
   defined; for we say that the last lack the complete and pre-eminent
   Power of the more reverend Divisions; for they participate in the
   partial and analogous, according to the one harmonious and binding
   fellowship of all things. For example, the rank of the holy Cherubim
   participates in higher wisdom and knowledge, but the Divisions of the
   Beings beneath them, participate, they also, in wisdom and knowledge,
   but nevertheless partially, as compared with them, and in a lower
   degree. For the participation of wisdom and knowledge throughout is
   common to all the minds which bear the image of God; but the being near
   and first, or second and inferior, is not common, but, as has been
   determined for each in its own degree. This also one might safely
   define respecting all the Divine Minds; for, as the first possess
   abundantly the saintly characteristics of the inferior, so the last
   possess those of the superior, not indeed in the same degree, but
   subordinately. There is, then, as I think, nothing absurd, if the Word
   of God calls our Hierarch, Angel, since he participates, according to
   his own capacity, in the messenger characteristic of the Angels, and
   elevates himself, as far as attainable to men, to the likeness of their
   revealing office.

   Section III.

   But you will find that the Word of God calls gods, both the Heavenly
   Beings above us, and the most beloved of God, and holy men amongst us,
   although the Divine Hiddenness is transcendently elevated and
   established above all, and no created Being can. properly and wholly be
   said to be like unto It, except those intellectual and rational Beings
   who are entirely and wholly turned to Its Oneness as far as possible,
   and who elevate themselves incessantly to Its Divine illuminations, as
   far as attainable, by their imitation of God, if I may so speak,
   according to their power, and are deemed worthy of the same divine
   name.
     __________________________________________________________________

  CAPUT XIII.

   For what reason the Prophet Isaiah is said to have been purified by the
   Seraphim.

   Section I.

   Come, then, let us examine this as best we can, why the Seraphim is
   said to be sent to one of the Theologians; for some one may object,
   that not one of the inferior Angels, but he, the enrolled amongst the
   most reverend Beings, cleanses the Prophet.

   Section II.

   Some, then, affirm that, according to the definition already given of
   the mutual relation of all the Minds, the Logion does not name one of
   the highest around God, as having come for the cleansing of the
   Theologian, but that some one of the Angels, placed over us as a sacred
   Minister of the Prophet's cleansing, is called by the same name. as the
   Seraphim, on the ground that the removal of the faults spoken of, and
   the restoration of him who was cleansed for the Divine mission, was
   through fire; and they say that the Logion speaks simply of one of the
   Seraphim, not one of those who are established around God, but one of
   the Powers set over us for the purpose of cleansing.

   Section III.

   Now another man brought forward to me a by no means foolish defence of
   the present position. For he said that that great one, whoever he
   was,--the Angel who formed this vision for the purpose of teaching the
   theologian Divine things,--referred his own cleansing function to God,
   and after God, to the first working Hierarchy. And was not this
   statement certainly true? For he who said this, affirmed that the
   supremely Divine Power in visiting all, advances and penetrates all
   irresistibly, and yet is invisible to all, not only as being
   superessentially elevated above all, but as secretly transmitting its
   providential energies to all; yea, rather, it is manifested to all the
   intellectual Beings in due degree, and by conducting Its own gift of
   Light to the most reverend Beings, through them, as first, It
   distributes in due order to the subordinate, according to the power of
   each Division to bear the vision of God; or to speak more strictly, and
   through familiar illustrations (for if they fall short of the Glory of
   God, Who is exalted above all, yet they are more illustrating for us),
   the distribution of the sun's ray passes with easy distribution to
   first matter, as being more transparent than all, and, through it with
   greater clearness, lights up its own splendours; but when it strikes
   more dense materials, its distributed brilliancy becomes more obscure,
   from the inaptitude of the materials illuminated for transmission of
   the gift of Light, and from this it is naturally contracted, so as to
   almost entirely exclude the passage of Light. Again, the heat of fire
   transmits itself chiefly to things that are more receptive, and
   yielding, and conductive to assimilation to itself; but, as regards
   repellent opposing substances, either it leaves none, or a very light,
   trace of its fiery energy; and further, when through substances
   favourable to its proper action, it comes in contact with things not
   congenial,--first, it perchance makes things easily changed to heating
   hot, and through them heats proportionately either water or something
   else which is not easily heated. After the same rule, then, of Nature's
   well-ordered method, the regulation of all good order, both visible and
   invisible, manifests supernaturally the brightness of its own gift of
   Light, in first manifestation to the most exalted Beings, in abundant
   streams, and through these, the Beings after them partake of the Divine
   ray. For these, as knowing God first, and striving preeminently after
   Divine virtue, and to become first-workers, are deemed worthy of the
   power and energy for the imitation of God, as attainable, and these
   benevolently elevate the beings after them to an equality, as far as
   possible, by imparting ungrudgingly to them the splendour which rests
   upon themselves, and these again to the subordinate, and throughout
   each Order, the first rank imparts its gift to that after it, and the
   Divine Light thus rests upon all, in due proportion, with providential
   forethought. There is, then, for all those who are illuminated, a
   Source of illumination, viz., God, by nature, and really, and properly,
   as Essence of Light, and Cause of Being, and Vision itself; but, by
   ordinance, and for Divine imitation, the relatively superior (is
   source) for each after it, by the fact, that the Divine rays are poured
   through it to that. All the remaining Angelic Beings, then, naturally
   regard the highest Order of the Heavenly Minds as source, after God, of
   every God-knowledge and God-imitation, since, through them, the
   supremely Divine illumination is distributed to all, and to us.
   Wherefore, they refer every holy energy of Divine imitation to God
   indeed as Cause, but to the first Godlike Minds, as first agents and
   teachers of things Divine.

   The first Order, then, of the holy Angels possesses, more than all, the
   characteristic of fire, and the streaming distribution of supremely
   Divine wisdom, and the faculty of knowing the highest science of the
   Divine illuminations, and the characteristic of Thrones, exhibiting
   their expansion for the reception of God; and the ranks of the
   subordinate Beings possess indeed the empyrean, the wise, the knowing,
   the God-receptive, faculty, but subordinately, and by looking to the
   first, and through them, as being deemed worthy of the Divine imitation
   in first operation, are conducted to the attainable likeness of God.
   The aforesaid holy characteristics, then, which the Beings after them
   possess, through the first, they attribute to those Beings themselves,
   after God, as Hierarchs.

   Section IV.

   He who said this, used to affirm, that this vision was shewn to the
   Theologian, through one of the holy and blessed Angels set over us, and
   that from his illuminating direction, he was elevated to that
   intellectual contemplation in which he saw the most exalted Beings
   seated (to speak symbolically) under God, and with God, and around
   [215] God, and the super-princely [216] Eminence elevated unspeakably
   above them and all, seated on high in the midst of the superior Powers.
   The Theologian then learned, from the things seen, that, as compared
   with every super-essential pre-eminence, the Divine Being was seated
   incomparably above every visible and invisible power, yea, even that It
   is exalted above all, as the Reality of all things, as Absolute--not
   even like to the first of created Beings;--further also, that It is
   source and essentiating Cause, and unalterable Fixity of the
   undissolved continuance of all things, from, Which is both the being
   and the well-being of the most exalted Powers themselves. Then he
   revealed that the Godlike powers of the most holy Seraphim, themselves,
   whose sacred appellation signifies the Fiery, concerning which we shall
   shortly speak as best we can, conducted the elevations of the empyrean
   power to the Divine likeness. And, the holy Theologian, by viewing the
   description of free and most exalted elevation of the sixfold wings to
   the Divine Being in first, middle, and last conceptions, and further,
   their endless feet and many faces, and their extended wings--one under
   their feet, and the other over their faces, as seen in vision, and the
   perpetual movement of their middle wings--was brought to the
   intelligible knowledge of the things seen, since there was manifested
   to him the power of the most exalted minds for deep penetration and
   contemplation, and the sacred reverence which they have,
   supermundanely, for the bold and courageous and unattainable scrutiny
   into higher and deeper mysteries; and of the incessant and high-flying
   perpetual movement of their Godlike energies in due proportion. But he
   was also taught the hidden mysteries of that supremely Divine and much
   esteemed Hymn of Praise--whilst the Angel who formed the vision
   imparts, as far as possible, his own sacred knowledge to the
   Theologian. He also taught him this, that the participation, as far as
   attainable, in the supremely Divine and radiant purity, is a
   purification to the pure however pure; and it being accomplished from
   the very Godhead by most exalted causes, for all the sacred Minds by a
   superessential hiddenness, is in a manner more clear, and exhibits and
   distributes itself, in a higher degree, to the highest powers around
   It; but with regard to the second, or us, the lowest mental powers, as
   each is distant from, as regards the Divine likeness, so It contracts
   its brilliant illumination to the single unknowable of its own
   hiddenness. And it illuminates the second, severally, through the
   first; and, if one must speak briefly, it is firstly brought from
   hiddenness to manifestation through the first powers. This, then, the
   Theologian was taught by the Angel who was leading him to Light--that
   purification, and all the supremely Divine operations, illuminating
   through the first Beings, are distributed to all the rest, according to
   the relation of each for the deifying participations. Wherefore he
   reasonably attributed to the Seraphim, after God, the characteristic of
   purification by fire. There is nothing, then, absurd, if the Seraphim
   is said to purify the Prophet. For, as God purifies all, by being cause
   of every purification, yea, rather (for I use a familiar illustration)
   just as our Hierarch, when purifying or enlightening through his
   Leitourgoi or Priests, is said himself to purify and enlighten, since
   the Orders consecrated through him attribute to him their own proper
   sacred operations; so also the Angel who effected the purification of
   the Theologian attributes his own purifying science and power to God,
   indeed, as Cause, but to the Seraphim as first-operating Hierarch; as
   any one might say with Angelic reverence, whilst teaching one who was
   being purified by him, "There is a preeminent Source, and Essence, and
   Worker, and Cause of the cleansing wrought upon you from me, He Who
   brings both the first Beings into Being, and holds them together by
   their fixity around Himself, and keeps them without change and without
   fall, moving them to the first participations of His own Providential
   energies (for this, He Who taught me these things used to say, shews
   the mission of the Seraphim), but as Hierarch and Leader after God, the
   Marshal of the most exalted Beings, from whom I was taught to purify
   after the example of God -- this is he, who cleanses thee through me,
   through whom the Cause and Creator of all cleansing brought forth His
   own provident energies from the Hidden even to us." These things, then,
   he taught me, and I impart them to thee. Let it be a part of thy
   intellectual and discriminating skill, either, to acquit each of the
   causes assigned from objection, and to honour this before the other as
   having likelihood and good reason, and perhaps, the truth; or, to find
   out from yourself something more allied to the real truth, or to learn
   from another; (God, of course, giving expression, and Angels supplying
   it;) and to reveal to us, the friends of Angels, a view more luminous
   if it should be so, and to me specially welcome.

  CAPUT XIV.

   What the traditional number of the Angels signifies.

   This also is worthy, in my opinion, of intellectual attention, that the
   tradition of the Oracles concerning the Angels affirms that they are
   thousand thousands, and myriad myriads, accumulating and multiplying,
   to themselves, the supreme limits of our numbers, and, through these,
   shewing clearly, that the ranks of the Heavenly Beings cannot be
   numbered by us. For many are the blessed hosts of the supermundane
   minds, surpassing the weak and contracted measurement of our material
   number, and being definitely known by their own supermundane and
   heavenly intelligence and science alone, which is given to them in
   profusion by the supremely Divine and Omniscient Framer of Wisdom, and
   essentiating Cause and connecting Force, and encompassing Term of all
   created things together.

   What are the morphic likenesses of the Angelic Powers? what the fiery?

   of the ox? what the appearance of the eagle? what the horses? what the
   varieties of coloured horses? what the rivers? what the chariots? what
   the wheels? what the so-called joy of the Angels?

   Section I.

   Come, then, let us at last, if you please, rest our mental vision from
   the strain of lofty contemplation, befitting Angels, and descend to the
   divided and manifold breadth of the many-shaped variety of the Angelic
   forms, and then return analytically from the same, as from images, to
   the simplicity of the Heavenly Minds. But let this first be made plain
   to you, that the explanations of the sacredly depicted likenesses
   represent the same ranks of the Heavenly Beings as sometimes ruling,
   and, at other times, as being ruled; and the last, ruling, and the
   first, being ruled; and the same, as has been said, having first, and
   middle, and last powers --without introducing anything absurd into the
   description, according to the following method of explanation. For if
   indeed we were to say that some are ruled by those above them, and then
   that they rule the same, and that those above, whilst ruling those
   below, are ruled by those same who are being ruled, the thing would
   manifestly be absurd, and mixed with all sorts of confusion. But if we
   say that the same rule and are ruled, but no longer the self-same, or
   from the self-same, but that each same is ruled by those before, and
   rules those below, one might say appropriately that the Divinely
   pictured presentations in the Oracles may sometimes attribute, properly
   and truly, the very same, both to first, and middle, and last powers.
   Now the straining elevation to things above, and their being drawn
   unswervingly around each other, as being guardians of their own proper
   powers, and that they participate in the providential faculty to
   provide for those below them by mutual communication, befit truly all
   the Heavenly Beings, although some, pre-eminently and wholly, as we
   have often said, and others partially and subordinately.

   Section II.

   But we must keep our discourse within bounds, and must search, in our
   first explanation of the types, for what reason the Word of God prefers
   the sacred description of fire, in preference to almost every other.
   You will find it, then, representing not only wheels of fire, but also
   living creatures of fire, and men, flashing, as it were, like
   lightning, and placing around the Heavenly Beings themselves heaps of
   coals of fire, and rivers of flame flowing with irresistible force; and
   also it says that the thrones are of fire; and that the most exalted
   Seraphim glow with fire, it shews from their appellation, and it
   attributes the characteristic and energy of fire to them, and
   throughout, above and below, it prefers pre-eminently the
   representation by the image of fire. I think, then, the similitude of
   fire [217] denotes the likeness of the Heavenly Minds to God in the
   highest degree; for the holy theologians frequently describe the
   superessential and formless essence by fire, as having many likenesses,
   if I may be permitted to say so, of the supremely Divine property, as
   in things visible. For the sensible fire is, so to speak, in
   everything, and passes through everything unmingled, and springs from
   all, and whilst all-luminous, is, as it were, hidden, unknown, in its
   essential nature, when there is no material lying near it upon which it
   may shew its proper energy. It is both uncontrollable and invisible,
   self-subduing all things, and bringing under its own energy anything in
   which it may happen to be; varying, imparting itself to all things near
   it, whatever they may be; renewing by its rousing heat, and giving
   light by its uncovered illuminations; invincible, unmingled,
   separating, unchangeable, elevating, penetrating, lofty; subject to no
   grovelling inferiority, ever moving, self-moving, moving other things,
   comprehending, incomprehended, needing no other, imperceptibly
   increasing itself, displaying its own majesty to the materials
   receiving it; energetic, powerful, present to all invisibly,
   unobserved, seeming not to be, and manifesting itself suddenly
   according to its own proper nature by friction, as it were by a sort of
   seeking, and again flying away impalpably, undiminished in all the
   joyful distributions of itself. And one might find many characteristics
   of fire, appropriate to display the supremely Divine Energy, as in
   sensible images. The Godly-wise, then, knowing this, depict the
   celestial Beings from fire, shewing their Godlikeness, and imitation of
   God, as far as attainable.

   Section III.

   But they also depict them under the likeness of men [218] , on account
   of the intellectual faculty, and their having powers of looking
   upwards, and their straight and erect form, and their innate faculty of
   ruling and guiding, and whilst being least, in physical strength as
   compared with the other powers of irrational creatures, yet ruling over
   all by their superior power of mind, and by their dominion in
   consequence of rational science, and their innate unslavishness and
   indomitableness of soul. It is possible, then, I think, to find within
   each of the many parts of our body harmonious images of the Heavenly
   Powers, by affirming that the powers of vision denote the most
   transparent elevation towards the Divine lights, and again, the tender,
   and liquid, and not repellent, but sensitive, and pure, and unfolded,
   reception, free from all passion, of the supremely Divine
   illuminations.

   Now the discriminating powers of the nostrils denote the being able to
   receive, as far as attainable, the sweet-smelling largess beyond
   conception, and to distinguish accurately things which are not such,
   and to entirely reject.

   The powers of the ears denote the participation and conscious reception
   of the supremely Divine inspiration.

   The powers of taste denote the fulness of the intelligible
   nourishments, and the reception of the Divine and nourishing streams.

   The powers of touch denote the skilful discrimination of that which is
   suitable or injurious.

   The eyelids and eyebrows denote the guarding of the conceptions which
   see God.

   The figures of manhood and youth denote the perpetual bloom and vigour
   of life.

   The teeth denote the dividing of the nourishing perfection given to us;
   for each intellectual Being divides and multiplies, by a provident
   faculty, the unified conception given to it by the more Divine for the
   proportionate elevation of the inferior.

   The shoulders and elbows, and further, the hands, denote the power of
   making, and operating, and accomplishing.

   The heart again is a symbol of the Godlike life, dispersing its own
   life-giving power to the objects of its forethought, as beseems the
   good.

   The chest again denotes the invincible and protective faculty of the
   life-giving distribution, as being placed above the heart.

   The back, the holding together the whole productive powers of life.

   The feet denote the moving and quickness, and skilfulness of the
   perpetual movement advancing towards Divine things. Wherefore also the
   Word of God arranged the feet of the holy Minds under their wings; for
   the wing displays the elevating quickness and the heavenly progress
   towards higher things, and the superiority to every grovelling thing by
   reason of the ascending, and the lightness of the wings denotes their
   being in no respect earthly, but undefiledly and lightly raised to the
   sublime; and the naked and unshod denotes the unfettered, agile, and
   unrestrained, and free from all external superfluity, and assimilation
   to the Divine simplicity, as far as attainable.

   Section IV.

   But since again the simple and variegated wisdom both clothes the
   naked, and distributes certain implements to them to carry, come, let
   us unfold, according to our power, the sacred garments and implements
   of the celestial Minds. The shining and glowing raiment, I think,
   signifies the Divine likeness after the image of fire, and their
   enlightening, in consequence of their repose in Heaven, where is the
   Light, and their complete illuminating intelligibly, and their being
   illuminated intellectually [219] ; and the sacerdotal robe denotes
   their conducting to Divine and mystical visions, and the consecration
   of their whole life. And the girdles signify the guard over their
   productive powers, and the collected habit of being turned uniformly to
   It, and being drawn around Itself by an unbroken identity, in a
   well-ordered circle.

   Section V.

   The rods signify the kingly and directing faculty, making all things
   straight. The spears and the battle-axes denote the dividing of things
   unlike, and the sharp and energetic and drastic operation of the
   discriminating powers. The geometrical and technical articles denote
   the founding, and building, and completing, and whatever else belongs
   to the elevating and guiding forethought for the subordinate Orders.
   But sometimes the implements assigned to the holy Angels are the
   symbols of God's judgments to ourselves; some, representing His
   correcting instruction or avenging righteousness, others, freedom from
   peril, or end of education, or resumption of former well-being, or
   addition of other gifts, small or great, sensible or intelligible. Nor
   would a discriminating mind, in any case whatever, have any difficulty
   in properly adapting things visible to things invisible.

   Section VI.

   But the fact that they are named winds denotes their rapid action,
   passing almost instantaneously to all things, and their transporting
   movement in passing from above to below, and again from below to above,
   their elevating the second to the height above, and moving the first to
   a common and provident advance of the inferior Orders. But perhaps some
   one would say that the appellation of wind, to the aerial spirit, also
   denotes the Divine likeness of the Heavenly Minds; for this also bears
   a likeness and type of the supremely Divine energy (as we have
   demonstrated more fully in the symbolic theology, in our explanation of
   the four elements) in accordance with the moving and life-producing,
   and the rapid and resistless development of Nature, and the Hiddenness
   of the moving sources and terminations to us unknown and invisible. For
   He says, "Thou knowest not whence it cometh nor whither it goeth." But
   also the Word of God attributes to them the appearance of a cloud,
   signifying, through this, that the holy minds are filled
   super-mundanely with the hidden Light, receiving the first
   manifestation without boasting over it as such, which they distribute
   ungrudgingly to the second, as a secondary manifestation, and in
   proportion to capacity; yea, further, that the productive, and
   life-producing, and increasing, and perfecting power is enshrined in
   them, after the fashion of the intelligible production of showers,
   which summons the receptive womb of the earth, by fruitful rains, to
   the life-giving pangs of birth.

   Section VII.

   Also, the Word of God attributes to the Heavenly Beings a likeness to
   Brass, Electron, and many-coloured stones. Electron, as being partly
   like gold, partly like silver, denotes the incorruptible, as in gold,
   and unexpended, and undiminished, and spotless brilliancy, and the
   brightness, as in silver, and a luminous and heavenly radiance. But to
   the Brass, according to the reasons assigned, must be attributed either
   the likeness of fire or that of gold.

   We must consider that the many-coloured appearances of stones denote
   either as white, the luminous; or as red, the fiery; or as yellow, the
   golden; or as green, the youthful and the full grown; and within each
   likeness you will find an explanation which teaches the inner meaning
   of the typical images.

   But since, I think, according to our power, this has been sufficiently
   said, let us pass to the sacred explanation of the Divine
   representations of the Heavenly Minds through wild beasts [220] . We
   must consider that the shape of a Lion [221] signifies the leading, and
   robust, and indomitable, and the assimilation, as far as possible, to
   the unutterable Godhead, by the concealment of the intellectual
   footprints [222] , and by the mystically modest covering of the path,
   leading to It, during Divine illumination.

   Section VIII.

   The Image of the Ox [223] denotes the strong and the mature, turning up
   the intellectual furrows for the reception of the heavenly and
   productive showers; and the Horns, the guarding and indomitable.

   The representation of the Eagle [224] denotes the kingly, and soaring,
   and swift in flight, and quickness in search of the nourishment which
   makes strong, and wanness, and agility, and cleverness; and the
   unimpeded, straight, and unflinching gaze towards the bounteous and
   brilliant splendour of the Divine rays of the sun, with the robust
   extension of the visual powers.

   That of Horses represents obedience and docility, and of those who are
   white, brilliancy, and as especially congenial to the Divine Light; but
   of those who are dark blue, the Hidden; and of those red, the fiery and
   vigorous; and of the piebald, the uniting of the extremes by the power
   passing through them, and joining the first to the second, and the
   second to the first, reciprocally and considerately.

   Now if we did not consult the proportion of our discourse, we might,
   not inappropriately, adapt the particular characteristics of the
   aforesaid living creatures, and all their bodily representations to the
   Heavenly Powers, upon the principle of dissimilar similitudes; for
   instance, their appearance of anger, to intellectual manliness, of
   which anger is the remotest echo, and their desire, to the Divine love;
   and to speak summarily, referring all the sensible perceptions, and
   many parts of irrational beings, to the immaterial conceptions and
   unified Powers of the Heavenly Beings. Now not only is this sufficient
   for the wise, but even an explanation of one of the dissimilar
   representations would be sufficient for the accurate description of
   similar things, after the same fashion.

   Section IX.

   But we must examine the fact that rivers are spoken of, and Wheels and
   Chariots attached to the Heavenly Beings. The rivers of fire signify
   the supremely Divine streams furnishing to them an ungrudging and
   incessant flow, and nourishing the productive powers of life; the
   chariots, the conjoined communion of those of the same rank; the wheels
   being winged, and advancing without turning and without deviation, the
   power of their advancing energy within a straight and direct path,
   towards the same unflinching and straight swoop of their every
   intellectual track, supermundanely straight and direct way. Also it is
   possible to explain, after another mystical meaning, the sacred
   description of the intellectual wheels; for the name Gel, Gel, is given
   to them, as the theologian says. This shews, according to the Hebrew
   tongue, revolutions and revelations. For the Empyrean and Godlike
   wheels have revolutions, indeed, by their perpetual movement around the
   Good Itself; but revelations, by the manifestation of things hidden,
   and by the elevation of things at our feet, and by the descending
   procession of the sublime illuminations to things below. There remains
   for accurate explanation, the statement respecting the rejoicing of the
   Heavenly Orders; for they are utterly incapable of our impassioned
   pleasure. Now they are said to rejoice with God over the discovery of
   what was lost, as befits their Divine good nature, and that Godlike and
   ungrudging rejoicing over the care and salvation of those who are
   turned to God; and that joy, beyond description, of which also holy men
   often partake, whilst the deifying illuminations of the Deity rest upon
   them. Let it suffice, then, to have said this much concerning the
   Divine representations, which, no doubt, falls short of their accurate
   explanation, but which will prevent us, I think, from being servilely
   entangled in the resemblance of the types. But if you should say that
   we have not mentioned in order the whole Angelic Powers, or operations,
   or likenesses, depicted in the Oracles, we answer in truth, that we do
   not possess the supermundane science of some; and further, in regard to
   them, we have need of another to conduct to light and to reveal. Other
   things, however, as being parallel to the things said, we have omitted,
   out of regard to the symmetry of the discourse; and the hiddenness,
   beyond our capacity, we have honoured by silence.

ECCLESIASTICAL HIERARCHY.
     __________________________________________________________________

  CAPUT I.

   To my Fellow Presbyter Timothy. Dionysius the Presbyter.

   What is the traditional view of the Ecclesiastical Hierarchy and what
   is its purpose?

   Section I.

   We must, then, most pious of pious sons, demonstrate from the
   supermundane and most sacred Oracles and traditions, that ours is a
   Hierarchy of the inspired and Divine and Deifying science, and of
   operation, and of consecration, for those who have been initiated with
   the initiation of the sacred revelation derived from the hierarchical
   mysteries. See, however, that you do not put to scorn things most holy
   (Holy of Holies); but rather treat them reverently, and you will honour
   the things of the hidden God by intellectual and obscure researches,
   carefully guarding them from the participation and defilement of the
   uninitiated, and reverently sharing holy things with the holy alone, by
   a holy enlightenment. For thus, as the Word of God has taught us who
   feast at His Banquet, even Jesus Himself--the most supremely Divine
   Mind and superessential, the Source and Essence, and most supremely
   Divine Power of every Hierarchy and Sanctification and Divine
   operation--illuminates the blessed Beings who are superior to us, in a
   manner more clear, and at the same time more intellectual, and
   assimilates them to His own Light, as far as possible; and by our love
   of things beautiful elevated to Him, and which elevates us, folds
   together our many diversities, and after perfecting into a uniform and
   Divine life and habit and operation, holily bequeaths the power of the
   Divine Priesthood; from which by approaching to the holy exercise of
   the priestly office, we ourselves become nearer to the Beings above us,
   by assimilation, according to our power, to their abiding and:
   unchangeable holy steadfastness; and thus by looking upwards to the
   blessed and supremely Divine self of Jesus, and reverently gazing upon
   whatever. we are permitted to see, and illuminated with the knowledge
   of the visions, we shall be able to become, as regards the science of
   Divine mysteries, purified and purifiers; images of Light, and workers,
   with God, perfected and perfecting.

   Section II.

   Then what is the Hierarchy of the Angels [225] and Archangels, and of
   supermundane Principalities and Authorities, Powers and Lordships, and
   Divine Thrones, or of the Beings of the same ranks as the
   Thrones--which the Word of God declares to be near, and always about
   God, and with [226] God, naming them in the Hebrew tongue Cherubim and
   Seraphim--by pondering the sacred ranks and divisions of their Orders
   and Hierarchies, you will find in the books we have written--not as
   befits their dignity but to the best of our ability--and as the
   Theology of the most holy Scriptures guided, when they extolled their
   Hierarchy. Nevertheless, it is necessary to say this, that both that,
   and every Hierarchy extolled now by us, has one and the same power,
   throughout the whole Hierarchical transaction; and that the Hierarch
   himself, according to his essence, and analogy, and rank, is initiated
   in Divine things, and is deified and imparts to the subordinates,
   according to the meetness of each for the sacred deification which
   comes to him from God; also that the subordinates follow the superior,
   and elevate the inferior towards things in advance; and that some go
   before, and, as far as possible, give the lead to others; and that
   each, as far as may be, participates in the truly Beautiful, and Wise,
   and Good, through this the inspired and sacerdotal harmony.

   But the Beings and ranks above us, of whom we have already made a
   reverent mention, are both incorporeal, and their Hierarchy is both
   intelligible and supermundane; but let us view our Hierarchy,
   comformably to ourselves, abounding in the variety of the sensible
   symbols, by which, in proportion to our capacity, we are conducted,
   hierarchically according to our measure, to the uniform deification
   --God and Divine virtue. They indeed, as minds, think, according to
   laws laid down for themselves; but we are led by sensible figures to
   the Divine contemplations, as is possible to us. And, to speak truly,
   there is One, to Whom all the Godlike aspire, but they do not partake
   uniformly of this One and the Same, but as the Divine balance
   distributes to each the meet inheritance. Now these things have been
   treated more systematically in the Treatise concerning "Intelligible
   and Sensible [227] ." But now I will attempt to describe our Hierarchy,
   both its source and essence, as best I can; invoking Jesus, the source
   and Perfecting of all Hierarchies.

   Section III.

   Every Hierarchy, then, is, according to our august tradition, the whole
   account of the sacred things falling under it, a most complete summary
   of the sacred rites of this or that Hierarchy, as the case may be. Our
   Hierarchy, then, is called, and is, the comprehensive system of the
   whole sacred rites included within it, according to which the divine
   Hierarch, being initiated, will have the communication of all the most
   sacred things within himself, as chief of Hierarchy. For as he who
   speaks of Hierarchy speaks of the order of the whole sacred rites
   collectively, so he, who mentions Hierarch, denotes the inspired and
   godly man--the skilled in all sacred knowledge--in whom the whole
   Hierarchy is clearly completed and recognized within himself.

   Head of this Hierarchy is the Fountain of Life, the Essence of
   Goodness, the one Triad, Cause of things that be, from Which both being
   and well-being come to things that be, by reason of goodness [228] . Of
   this most supremely Divine blessedness --exalted beyond all, the
   threefold Monad, the really Being,--the Will, inscrutable to us, but
   known to Itself, is the rational preservation of beings amongst us and
   above us; but that (preservation) cannot otherwise take place, except
   those who are, being saved are being deified. Now the assimilation to,
   and union with, God, as far as attainable, is deification. And this is
   the common goal of every Hierarchy,--the clinging love towards God and
   Divine things divinely and uniformly ministered; and previous to this,
   the complete and unswerving removal of things contrary, the knowledge
   of things as they are in themselves; the vision and science of sacred
   truth; the inspired communication of the uniform perfection of the One
   Itself, as far as attainable; the banquet of contemplation, nourishing
   intelligibly, and deifying every man elevated towards it.

   Section IV.

   Let us affirm, then, that the supremely Divine Blessedness, the
   essential Deity, the Source of deification, from Which comes the
   deification of those deified, bequeathed, by Divine Goodness, the
   Hierarchy, for preservation, and deification of all rational and
   intellectual Beings. And to the supermundane and blessed inheritances
   there is bequeathed something more immaterial and intellectual (for
   Almighty God does not move them to things divine, from without, but
   intelligibly, since they are illuminated as to the most Divine will
   from within, with brilliancy pure and immaterial), but to us--that
   which has been bequeathed to them, uniformly, and enveloped, is
   bequeathed from the Divinely transmitted Oracles, in a variety and
   multitude of divisible symbols, as we are able to receive it. For the
   Divinely transmitted Oracles are essence of our Hierarchy. And we
   affirm that these Oracles--all such as were given from our godly
   initiators in inspired Letters of the Word of God --are most august;
   and further, whatever our leaders have revealed to us from the same
   holy men, by a less material initiation, and already akin, as it were,
   to the Heavenly Hierarchy, from mind to mind, through the medium of
   speech, corporeal, indeed, but nevertheless more immaterial, without
   writing. Nor did the inspired Hierarchs transmit these things, in
   conceptions clear to the commonalty of worshippers, but in sacred
   symbols. For it is not every one that is hallowed; nor, as the Oracles
   affirm, does knowledge belong to all.

   Section V.

   Necessarily, then, the first leaders of our Hierarchy, after having
   been filled themselves with the sacred gift, from the superessential
   Godhead, and sent, by the supremely Divine Goodness, to extend the same
   gift successively, and, as godly, earnestly desiring themselves the
   elevation and deification of those after them, presented to us--by
   their written and unwritten revelations--in accordance with their
   sacred injunctions, things supercelestial, by sensible images, the
   enfolded, by variety and multitude, and things Divine, by things human,
   and things immaterial, by things material, and the superessential, by
   things belonging to us. Nor did they do this merely on account of the
   unhallowed, to whom it is not permitted even to touch the symbols, but
   because our Hierarchy is, as I said, a kind of symbol adapted to our
   condition, which needs things sensible, for our more Divine elevation
   from these to things intelligible. Nevertheless the reasons of the
   symbols have been revealed to the Divine initiators, which it is not
   permitted to explain to those who are yet being initiated, knowing that
   the Lawgivers of things divinely transmitted deliberately arranged the
   Hierarchy in well-established and unconfused ranks, and in
   proportionate and sacred distributions of that which was convenient to
   each, according to fitness. Wherefore trusting in thy sacred promises
   (for it is a pious duty to recall them to thy recollection) -- that,
   since every Hierarchical sacred word is of binding force, thou wilt not
   communicate to any other but those Godlike initiators of the same rank
   with thyself, and wilt persuade them to promise, according to
   hierarchical regulation, to touch pure things purely, and to
   communicate the mysteries of God to the godly alone, and things perfect
   to those capable of perfection, and things altogether most holy to the
   holy, I have entrusted this Divine gift to thee, in addition to many
   other Hierarchical gifts.

  CAPUT II.

   I. Concerning things done in Illumination.

   We have, then, reverently affirmed that this is the purpose of our
   Hierarchy, viz., our assimilation and union with God, as far as
   attainable. And, as the Divine Oracles teach, we shall attain this only
   by the love and the religious performance of the most worshipful
   Commandments. For He says: "He [229] that loveth Me will keep My Word,
   and My Father will love him, and we will come unto him, and will make
   Our abode with him." What, then, is source of the religious performance
   of the most august commandments? Our preparation for the restitution of
   the supercelestial rest, which forms the habits of our souls into an
   aptitude for the reception of the other sacred sayings and doings [230]
   , the transmission of our holy and most divine regeneration [231] .
   For, as our illustrious Leader used to say, the very first movement of
   the mind towards Divine things is the willing reception of Almighty
   God, but the very earliest step of the religious reception towards the
   religious performance of the Divine commandments is the unutterable
   operation of our being from God. For if our [232] being from God is the
   Divine engendering, never would he know, and certainly never perform,
   any of the Divine instructions, who had not had his beginning to be in
   God. To speak after the manner of men, must we not first begin to be,
   and then to do, our affairs? Since he, who does not exist at all, has
   neither movement nor even beginning; since he, who in some way exists,
   alone does, or suffers, those things suitable to his own nature. This,
   then, as I think, is clear. Let us next contemplate the Divine symbols
   of the birth in God. And I pray, let no uninitiated person approach the
   sight [233] ; for neither is it without danger to gaze upon the
   glorious rays of the sun with weak eyes, nor is it without peril to put
   our hand to things above us. For right was the priesthood of the Law,
   when rejecting Osias, because he put his hand to sacred things; and
   Korah, because to things sacred above his capacity; and Nadab and
   Abihu, because they treated things, within their own province,
   unholily.

   II. Mysterion of Illumination.

   Section I.

   The Hierarch, then, wishing that all men whatsoever should be saved by
   their assimilation towards God, and come to recognition of truth,
   proclaims to all the veritable Good News, that God being compassionate
   towards those upon earth, out of His own proper and innate goodness,
   deigned Himself to come to us with outstretched arms, by reason of
   loving-kindness towards men; and, by the union with Him, to assimilate,
   like as by fire, things that have been made one, in proportion to their
   aptitude for deification. "For as many as received Him, to them gave He
   power to become children of God--to those who believe on His Name, who
   were begotten, not of bloods, nor of will of flesh, but of God [234] ."

   Section II.

   He, who has felt a religious longing to participate in these truly
   supermundane gifts, comes to some one of the initiated, and persuades
   him to act as his conductor to the Hierarch. He then professes wholly
   to follow the teaching that shall be given to him, and prays him to
   undertake the superintendence of his introduction, and of all his after
   life. Now he, though religiously longing for his salvation, when he
   measures human infirmity against the loftiness of the undertaking, is
   suddenly seized with a shivering and sense of incapacity, nevertheless,
   at last, he agrees, with a good grace, to do what is requested, and
   takes and leads him to the chief Hierarch.

   Section III.

   He, then, when with joy he has received, as the sheep upon his
   shoulders, the two men, and has first worshipped, glorifies with a
   mental thanksgiving and bodily prostration the One beneficent Source,
   from Which, those who are being called, are called, and those who are
   being saved, are saved.

   Section IV.

   Then collecting a full religious assembly into the sacred place, for
   co-operation, and common rejoicing over the man's salvation, and for
   thanksgiving for the Divine Goodness, he first chants a certain hymn,
   found in the Oracles, accompanied by the whole body of the Church; and
   after this, when he has kissed the holy table, he advances to the man
   before him, and demands of him, what has brought him here?

   Section V.

   When the man, out of love to God, has confessed, according to the
   instruction of his sponsor, his ungodliness, his ignorance of the
   really beautiful, his insufficiency for the life in God, and prays,
   through his holy mediation, to attain to God and Divine things, he (the
   Hierarch) testifies to him, that his approach ought to be entire, as to
   God Who is All Perfect, and without blemish; and when he has expounded
   to him fully the godly course of life, and has demanded of him, if he
   would thus live,--after his promise he places his right hand upon his
   head, and when he has sealed him, commands the priests to register the
   man and his sponsor.

   Section VI.

   When these have enrolled the names, he makes a holy prayer, and when
   the whole Church have completed this with him, he looses his sandals,
   and removes his clothing, through the Leitourgoi. Then, when he has
   placed him facing the west and beating his hands, averted towards the
   same quarter, he commands him thrice to breathe scorn upon Satan, and
   further, to profess the words of the renunciation. When he has
   witnessed his threefold renunciation, he turns him back to the east,
   after he has professed this thrice; and when he has looked up to
   heaven, and extended his hands thitherward, he commands him to be
   enrolled under Christ, and all the Divinely transmitted Oracles of God.
   When the man has done this, he attests again for him his threefold
   profession, and again, when he has thrice professed, after prayer, he
   gives thanks, and lays his hand upon him.

   Section VII.

   When the Deacons have entirely unclothed him, the Priests bring the
   holy oil of the anointing. Then he begins the anointing, through the
   threefold sealing, and for the rest assigns the man to the Priests, for
   the anointing of his whole body, while himself advances to the mother
   of filial adoption, and when he has purified the water within it by the
   holy invocations, and perfected it by three cruciform effusions of the
   altogether most pure Muron [235] , and by the same number of injections
   of the all holy Muron, and has invoked the sacred melody of the
   inspiration of the God-rapt Prophets, he orders the man to be brought
   forward; and when one of the Priests, from the register, has announced
   him [236] and his surety, he is conducted by the Priests near the water
   to the hand of the Hierarch, being led by the hand to him. Then the
   Hierarch, standing above, when the Priests have again called aloud near
   the Hierarch within the water the name of the initiated, the Hierarch
   dips him three times, invoking the threefold Subsistence of the Divine
   Blessedness, at the three immersions and emersions of the initiated.
   The Priests then take him, and entrust him to the Sponsor and guide of
   his introduction; and when they, in conjunction with him, have cast
   over the initiated appropriate clothing, they lead him again to the
   Hierarch, who, when he has sealed the man with the most Divinely
   operating Muron, pronounces him to be henceforward partaker of the most
   Divinely initiating Eucharist.

   Section VIII.

   When he has finished these things, he elevates himself from his
   progression to things secondary, to the contemplation of things [237]
   first, as one, who, at no time or manner, turns himself to any other
   thing whatever than those which are peculiarly his own, but from things
   Divine to Divine,--is persistently and always ranging himself under the
   banner of the supremely Divine Spirit.

   III. Contemplation.

   Section I.

   This initiation, then, of the holy birth in God, as in symbols, has
   nothing unbecoming or irreverent, nor anything of the sensible images,
   but (contains) enigmas of a contemplation worthy of God, likened to
   physical and human images. For how should it appear misleading? Even
   when the very divine meaning of the things done is passed over in
   silence, [238] the divine Instruction might convince, religiously
   pursuing as it does the good life of the candidate, enjoining upon him
   the purification from every kind of evil, through a virtuous and Divine
   life, by the physical cleansing through the agency of water in a bodily
   form. This symbolic teaching then of the things done, even if it had
   nothing more divine, would not be without religious value, as I think,
   introducing a discipline of a well-regulated life, and. suggesting
   mysteriously, through the total bodily purification by water, the
   complete purification from the evil life.

   Section II.

   Let this, then, be, for the uninitiated, a conducting guidance of the
   soul, which separates, as is meet things sacred and uniform from
   multiplicity, and apportions the harmonious elevation to the Orders
   severally in turn. But we, who have ascended by sacred gradations to
   the sources of the things performed, and have been religiously taught
   these (sources), shall recognize of what moulds they are the reliefs,
   and of what invisible things they are the likenesses. For, as is
   distinctly shewn in the Treatise concerning "Intelligible and
   Sensible," sacred things in sensible forms are copies of things
   intelligible, to which they lead and shew the way; and things
   intelligible are source and science of things hierarchical cognizable
   by the senses.

   Section III.

   Let us affirm, then, that the goodness of the Divine Blessedness is
   always in the same condition and manner, unfolding the beneficent rays
   of its own light upon all the intellectual visions without grudging.
   Should, then, the self-choosing self-sufficiency of the contemplators
   either turn away from the light contemplated, by closing, through love
   of evil, the faculties for enlightenment naturally implanted within it,
   it would be separated from the light present to it, not turned away,
   but shining upon it when shortsighted and turning its face from light
   generously running to it; or should it overstep the bounds of the
   visible given to it in due proportion, and rashly undertake to gaze
   upon the rays superior to its vision, the light indeed will do nothing
   beyond its proper functions, but it, by imperfectly approaching thing's
   perfect, would not attain to things unsuitable, and, by stupidly
   disregarding the due proportion, would fail through its own fault.

   But, as I said, the Divine Light is always unfolded beneficently to the
   intellectual visions, and it is possible for them to seize it when
   present, and always being most ready for the distribution of things
   appropriate, in a manner becoming God. To this imitation the divine
   Hierarch is fashioned, unfolding to all, without grudging, the luminous
   rays of his inspired teaching, and, after the Divine example, being
   most ready to enlighten the proselyte, neither using a grudging nor an
   unholy wrath for former back-slidings or excess, but, after the example
   of God, always enlightening by his conducting light those who approach
   him, as becomes a Hierarch, in fitness, and order, and in proportion to
   the aptitude of each for holy things.

   Section IV.

   But, inasmuch as the Divine Being is source of sacred order, within
   which the holy Minds regulate themselves, he, who recurs to the proper
   view of Nature, will see his proper self in what he was originally, and
   will acquire this, as the first holy gift, from his recovery to the
   light. Now he, who has well looked upon his own proper condition with
   unbiassed eyes, will depart from the gloomy recesses of ignorance, but
   being imperfect he will not, of his own accord, at once desire the most
   perfect union and participation of God, but little by little will be
   carried orderly and reverently through things present to things more
   forward, and through these to things foremost, and when perfected, to
   the supremely Divine summit. An illustration of this decorous and
   sacred order is the modesty of the proselyte, and his prudence in his
   own affairs in having the sponsor as leader of the way to the Hierarch.
   The Divine Blessedness receives the man, thus conducted, into communion
   with Itself, and imparts to him the proper light as a kind of sign,
   making him godly and sharer of the inheritance of the godly, and sacred
   ordering; of which things the Hierarch's seal, given to the proselyte,
   and the saving enrolment of the priests are a sacred symbol,
   registering him amongst those who are being saved, and placing in the
   sacred memorials, beside himself also his sponsor,--the one indeed, as
   a true lover of the life-giving way to truth and a companion of a godly
   guide, and the other, as an unerring conductor of his follower by the
   Divinely-taught directions.

   Section V.

   Yet it is not possible to hold, conjointly, qualities thoroughly
   opposed, nor that a man who has had a certain fellowship with the One
   should have divided lives, if he clings to the firm participation in
   the One; but he must be resistless and resolute, as regards all
   separations from the uniform. This it is which the teaching of the
   symbols reverently and enigmatically intimates, by stripping the
   proselyte, as it were, of his former life, and discarding to the very
   utmost the habits within that life, makes him stand naked and barefoot,
   looking away towards the west, whilst he spurns, by the aversion of his
   hands, the participations in the gloomy baseness, and breathes out, as
   it were, the habit of dissimilarity which he had acquired, and
   professes the entire renunciation of everything contrary to the Divine
   likeness. When the man has thus become invincible and separate from
   evil, it turns him towards the east, declaring clearly that his
   position and recovery will be purely in the Divine Light, in the
   complete separation from baseness; and receiving his sacred promises of
   entire consort with the One, since he has become uniform through love
   of the truth. Yet it is pretty evident, as I think, to those versed in
   Hierarchical matters, that things intellectual acquire the
   unchangeableness of the Godlike habit, by continuous and persistent
   struggles towards one, and by the entire destruction and annihilation
   of things contrary. For it is necessary that a man should not only
   depart from every kind of baseness, but he must be also bravely
   obdurate and ever fearless against the baneful submission to it. Nor
   must he, at any time, become remiss in his sacred love of the truth,
   but with all his power persistently and perpetually be elevated towards
   it, always religiously pursuing his upward course, to the more perfect
   mysteries of the Godhead.

   Section VI.

   Now you may see the distinct illustrations of these things in the
   religious rites performed by the Hierarch. For the Godlike Hierarch
   starts with the holy anointing, and the Priests under him complete the
   Divine service of the Chrism, summoning in type the man initiated to
   the holy contests, within which he is placed under Christ as Umpire:
   since, as God, He is Institutor of the awards of contest, and as wise,
   He placed its laws, and as generous, the prizes suitable to the
   victors. And this is yet more Divine, since as good, He devotedly
   entered the lists with them, contending, on behalf of their freedom and
   victory, for their power over death and destruction, he who is being
   initiated will enter the contests, as those of God, rejoicing, and
   abides by the regulations of the Wise, and contends according to them,
   without transgression holding fast the hope of the beautiful rewards,
   as being enrolled under a good Lord and Leader of the awards: and when
   after following in the Divine footsteps of the first of athletes,
   through goodness, he has overthrown, in his struggles after the Divine
   example, the energies and impulses opposed to his deification, he dies
   with Christ--to speak mystically --to sin, in Baptism.

   Section VII.

   And consider attentively, I pray, with what appropriateness the holy
   symbols are presented. For since death is with us not an annihilation
   of being, as others surmise, but the separating of things united,
   leading to that which is invisible to us, the soul indeed becoming
   invisible through deprivation of the body, and the body, through being
   buried in earth in consequence of one of its bodily changes, becoming
   invisible to human ken, appropriately, the whole covering by water
   would be taken as an image of death, and the invisible tomb. The
   symbolical teaching, then, reveals in mystery that the man baptized
   according to religious rites, imitates, so far as Divine imitation is
   attainable to men, by the three immersions in the water, the supremely
   Divine death of the Life-giving Jesus, Who spent three days and three
   nights in the tomb, in Whom, according to the mystical and secret
   teaching of the sacred text, the Prince of the world found nothing.

   Section VIII.

   Next, they throw garments, white as light, over the man initiated. For
   by his manly and Godlike insensibility to contrary passions, and by his
   persistent inclination towards the One, the unadorned is adorned, and
   the shapeless takes shape, being made brilliant by his luminous life.

   But the perfecting unction of the Muron makes the man initiated of good
   odour, for the holy perfecting of the Divine birth unites those who
   have been perfected to the supremely Divine Spirit. Now the
   overshadowing which makes intelligibly of a good savour, and perfect,
   as being most unutterable, I leave to the mental consciousness of those
   who are deemed worthy of the sacred and deifying participation of the
   Holy Spirit within their mind.

   At the conclusion of all, the Hierarch calls the man initiated to the
   most Holy Eucharist, and imparts to him the communion of the perfecting
   mysteries.

  CAPUT III.

   I. Concerning things accomplished in the Synaxis.

   Courage, then, since we have made mention of this (Eucharist) which we
   may not pass over to celebrate any other Hierarchical function in
   preference to it. For according to our illustrious Leader, it is
   "initiation of initiations," and one must first lay down the Divine
   description of it, before the rest, from the inspired and hierarchical
   science of the Oracles, and then be borne by the supremely Divine
   Spirit to its sacred contemplation. First, let us reverently consider
   this; for what reason that, which is common also to the other
   Hierarchical initiations, is pre-eminently attributed to it, beyond the
   rest; and it is uniquely called, "Communion and Synaxis," when each
   consecrating function both collects our divided lives into uniform
   deification, and gives communion and union with the One, by the Godlike
   folding together of our diversities. Now we affirm that the Perfecting
   by the communications of the other Hierarchical symbols springs from
   the supremely Divine and perfecting gifts of it. For it scarcely ever
   happens, that any Hierarchical initiation is completed without the most
   Divine Eucharist, as head of the things done in each, ministering the
   collecting of the person initiated to the One, and completing his
   communion with God, by the Divinely transmitted gift of the perfecting
   mysteries. If, then, each of the Hierarchical initiations, being indeed
   incomplete, will not make perfect our communion and our gathering to
   the One, even its being initiation is precluded on account of the lack
   of completeness. Now since the imparting of the supremely Divine
   mysteries to the man initiated is the head and tail of every
   initiation, naturally then the Hierarchical judgment hit upon an
   appellation propel to it, from the truth of the facts. Thus, for
   instance, with regard to the holy initiation of the Divine birth; since
   it imparts first-Light, and is head of all the Divine illuminations, we
   celebrate the true appellation from the enlightening effected. For,
   though it be common to all Hierarchical functions to impart the gift of
   sacred light to those initiated, yet it [239] gave to me the power to
   see first, and through its first light I am enlightened to gaze upon
   the other religious rites. Having said this, let us minutely
   investigate and examine hierarchically the accurate administration and
   contemplation of the most pure initiation, in every particular.

   II. Mysterion [240] of Synaxis, that is, Communion.

   The Hierarch, having completed a reverent prayer, near the Divine
   Altar, starts with the incensing, and proceeds to every part of the
   enclosure of the sacred place; he then returns to the Divine Altar, and
   begins the sacred chanting of the Psalms, the whole ecclesiastical
   assembly chanting, with him, the sacred language of the Psalter. Next
   follows the reading of the Holy Scriptures by the Leitourgoi. After
   these readings the catechumens quit the sacred enclosure, as well as
   the "possessed," and the penitents. But those who are deemed worthy of
   the sight and participation of the Divine Mysteries remain. Of the
   Leitourgoi, some stand near the closed gates of the sanctuary, whilst
   others perform some other duty of their own rank. But chosen members of
   the ministering Order with the Priests lay the holy Bread and the Cup
   of Blessing upon the Divine Altar, whilst the universal Song [241] of
   Praise is being professed beforehand by the whole body of the Church.
   Added to these, the Divine Hierarch makes a sacred prayer, and
   proclaims the holy Peace to all. When all have kissed each other, the
   mystical proclamation of the holy tablets is performed. When the
   Hierarch and the Priests have washed their hands in water, the Hierarch
   stands in the midst of the Divine Altar, and the chosen Deacons alone,
   with the Priests, stand around. The Hierarch, when he has sung the
   sacred works of God, ministers things most divine, and brings to view
   the things sung, through the symbols reverently exposed [242] , and
   when he has shewn the gifts of the works of God [243] , he first
   proceeds to the sacred participation of the same, and turns and exhorts
   the others. When he has received and distributed the supremely Divine
   Communion, he terminates with a holy thanksgiving; whilst the multitude
   have merely glanced at the Divine symbols alone, he is ever conducted
   by the Divine Spirit, as becomes a Hierarch, in the purity of a Godlike
   condition, to the holy sources of the things performed, in blessed and
   intelligible visions.

   III. Contemplation.

   Section I.

   Here then, too, O excellent son, after the images, I come in due order
   and reverence to the Godlike reality of the archetypes, saying here to
   those yet being initiated, for the harmonious guidance of their souls,
   that the varied and sacred composition of the symbols is not without
   spiritual contemplation for them, as merely presented superficially.
   For the most sacred chants and readings of the Oracles teach them a
   discipline of a virtuous life, and previous to this, the, complete
   purification from destructive evil; and the most Divine, and common,
   and peaceful distribution of one and the same, both Bread and Cup,
   enjoins upon them a godly fellowship in character, as having a
   fellowship in food, and recalls to their memory the most Divine Supper,
   and arch-symbol of the rites performed, agreeably with which the
   Founder of the symbols Himself excludes, most justly, him who had
   supped with Him on the holy things, not piously [244] and in a manner
   suitable to his character; teaching at once, clearly and Divinely, that
   the approach to Divine mysteries with a sincere mind confers, on those
   who draw nigh, the participation in a gift according to their own
   character.

   Section II.

   Let us, then, as I said, leave behind these things, beautifully
   depicted upon the entrance of the. innermost shrine, as being
   sufficient for those, who are yet incomplete for contemplation, and let
   us proceed from the effects to the causes; and then, Jesus lighting the
   way, we shall view our holy Synaxis, and the comely contemplation of
   things intelligible, which makes radiantly manifest the blessed beauty
   of the archetypes. But, oh, most Divine and holy initiation, uncovering
   the folds of the dark mysteries enveloping thee in symbols, be manifest
   to us in thy bright glory, and fill our intellectual visions with
   single and unconcealed light.

   Section III.

   We must, then, in my opinion, pass within the All Holy Mysteries, after
   we have laid bare the intelligible of the first of the votive gifts, to
   gaze upon its Godlike beauty, and view the Hierarch, divinely going
   with sweet fragrance from the Divine Altar to the furthermost bounds of
   the holy place, and again returning to it to complete the function. For
   the Blessedness, supremely Divine above all, even if, through Divine
   goodness, It goes forth to the communion of the holy who participate in
   It, yet It never goes outside its essential unmoved position and
   steadfastness; and illuminates all the Godlike in due degree, being
   always self-centred, and in nowise moved from its own proper identity;
   so, too, the Divine initiation (sacrament) of the Synaxis, although it
   has a unique, and simple, and enfolded Source, is multiplied, out of
   love towards man, into the holy variety of the symbols, and travels
   through the whole range of the supremely Divine description; yet
   uniformly it is again collected from these, into its own proper Monady,
   and unifies those who are being reverently conducted towards it. In the
   same Godlike manner, the Divine Hierarch, if he benignly lowers to his
   subordinates his own unique Hierarchical science, by using the
   multiplicities of the holy enigmas, yet again, as absolute, and not to
   be held in check by smaller things, he is restored to his proper
   headship without diminution, and, when he has made the intellectual
   entry of himself to the One, he sees clearly the uniform raisons d'être
   of the things done, as he makes the goal of his philanthropic progress
   to things secondary the more Divine [245] return to things primary.

   Section IV.

   The chanting of the Psalms, being co-essential with almost all the
   Hierarchical mysteries, was not likely to be separated from the most
   Hierarchical of all. For every holy and inspired Scripture sets forth
   for those meet for deification, either the originated beginning and
   ordering of things from God; or the Hierarchy and polity of the Law; or
   the distributions and possessions of the inheritances of the people of
   God; or the understanding of sacred judges, or of wise kings, or of
   inspired Priests: or philosophy of men of old time, unshaken in
   endurances of the things let loose in variety and multitude; or the
   treasures of wisdom for the conduct of life; or songs and inspired
   pictures of Divine Loves; or the declaratory predictions of things to
   come; or the Theandric works of Jesus; or the God-transmitted and
   God-imitating polities and holy teachings of His Disciples, or the
   hidden and mystic gaze of the beloved and divinely sweet of the
   disciples, or the supermundane theology of Jesus; and implanted them in
   the holy and Godlike instructions of the mystic rites. Now the sacred
   description of the Divine Odes, whose purpose is to sing the words and
   works of God throughout, and to praise the holy words and works of
   godly men, forms an universal Ode and narrative of things Divine, and
   makes, in those who inspiredly recite it, a habit suitable for the
   reception and distribution of every Hierarchical mystery.

   Section V.

   When, then, the comprehensive melody of the holy Hymns has harmonized
   the habits of our souls to the things which are presently to be
   ministered, and, by the unison of the Divine Odes, as one and
   concordant chorus of holy men, has established an accord with things
   Divine, and themselves [246] , and one another, the things, more
   strained and obscure in the intellectual language of the mystic Psalms,
   are expanded by the most holy lections of the inspired writings,
   through more full and distinct images and narratives. He, who devoutly
   contemplates these, will perceive the uniform and one conspiration, as
   being moved by One, the supremely Divine Spirit. Hence, naturally, in
   the history of the world, after the more ancient [247] tradition, the
   new Covenant is proclaimed; the inspired and Hierarchical order
   teaching this, as I think, that the one affirmed the Divine works of
   Jesus, as to come; but the other accomplished; and as that described
   the truth in figures, this shewed it present. For the accomplishment,
   within this, of the predictions of that, established the truth, and the
   work of God is a consummation of the Word of God.

   Section VI.

   Those who absolutely have no ear for these sacred initiations do not
   even recognize the images,-- unblushingly rejecting the saving
   revelation of the Divine Birth, and in opposition to the Oracles reply
   to their destruction, "Thy ways I do not wish to know."

   Now the regulation of the holy Hierarchy permits the catechumens, and
   the possessed, and the penitents, to hear the sacred chanting of the
   Psalms, and the inspired reading of the all-Holy Scriptures; but it
   does not invite them to the next religious services and contemplations,
   but only the eyes of the initiated. For the Godlike Hierarchy is full
   of reverent justice, and distributes savingly to each, according to
   their due, bequeathing savingly the harmonious communication of each of
   the things Divine, in measure, and proportion, and due time. The lowest
   rank, then, is assigned to the catechumens, for they are without
   participation and instruction in every Hierarchical initiation, not
   even having the being in God by Divine Birth, but are yet being brought
   to [248] Birth by the Paternal Oracles, and moulded, by life-giving
   formations, towards the blessed introduction to their first life and
   first light from Birth in God. As, then, children after the flesh, if,
   whilst immature and unformed, they should anticipate their proper
   delivery, as untimely born and abortions, will fall to earth without
   life and without light; and no one, in his senses, would say from what
   he saw, that they, released from the darkness of the womb, were brought
   to the light (for the medical authority, which is learned in the
   functions of the body, would say that light operates on things
   receptive of light); so also the all-wise science of religious rites
   brings these first to delivery, by the preparatory nourishment of the
   formative and life-giving Oracles; and when it has made their person
   ripe for Divine Birth, gives to them savingly, in due order, the
   participation in things luminous and perfecting; but, at present, it
   separates things perfect from them as imperfect, consulting the good
   order of sacred things, and the delivery and life of the catechumens,
   in a Godlike order of the Hierarchical rites.

   Section VII.

   Now the multitude of the possessed indeed is unholy, but it is next
   above the catechumens, which is lowest. Nor is that which has received
   a certain participation in the most holy offices, but is yet entangled
   by contrary qualities, whether enchantments or terrors, on a par, as I
   think, with the altogether uninitiated and entirely uncommunicated in
   the Divine initiations; but, even for them, the view and participation
   in the holy mysteries is contracted, and very properly. For, if it be
   true that the altogether godly man, the worthy partaker of the Divine
   mysteries, the one carried to the very summit of the Divine likeness,
   to the best of his powers, in complete and most perfect deifications,
   does not even perform the things of the flesh, beyond the most
   necessary requirements of nature, and then as a parergon, but will be,
   at the same time, a temple, and a follower, according to his ability,
   of the supremely Divine Spirit, in the highest deification, implanting
   like in like;--such an one as this would never be possessed by opposing
   phantoms or fears, but will laugh them to scorn, and when they
   approach, will cast them down and put them to flight, and will act
   rather than comply, and in addition to the passionless and
   indomitableness of his own character, will be seen also a physician to
   others, for such "possessions" as these; (and I think further, yea,
   rather, I know certainly that the most impartial discrimination of
   Hierarchical persons knows more than they [249] , that such as are
   possessed with a most detestable possession, by departing from the
   Godlike life, become of one mind and one condition with destructive
   demons, by turning themselves from things that really are, and undying
   possessions, and everlasting pleasures, for the sake of the most base
   and impassioned folly destructive to themselves; and by desiring and
   pursuing the earthly variableness, and the perishable and corrupting
   pleasures, and the unstable comfort in things foreign to their nature,
   not real but seeming;) these then, first, and more properly than those,
   were shut out by the discriminating authority of the Deacon; for it is
   not permitted to them to have part in any other holy function than the
   teaching of the Oracles, which is likely to turn them to better things.
   For, if the supermundane Service of the Divine Mysteries excludes those
   under penitence, and those who have already attained it, not permitting
   anything to come near which is not completely perfect, and proclaims,
   and this in all sincerity, that "I am unseen and uncommunicated by
   those who are in any respect imperfectly weak as regards the summit of
   the Divine Likeness" (for that altogether most pure voice scares away
   even those who cannot be associated with the worthy partakers of the
   most Divine mysteries).; how much more, then, will the multitude of
   those who are under the sway of their passions be unhallowed and alien
   from every sight and participation in the holy mysteries. When, then,
   the uninitiated in the mysteries, and the imperfect, and with them the
   apostates from the religious life, and after them, those who through
   unmanliness are prone to the fears and fancies of contrary influences,
   as not reaching through the persistent and indomitable inclination
   towards godliness, the stability and activity of a Godlike condition;
   then, in addition to these, those who have separated indeed from the
   contrary life, but have not yet been cleansed from its imaginations by
   a godly and pure habit and love, and next, those who are not altogether
   uniform, and to use an expression of the Law, "entirely without spot
   and blemish," when these have been excluded from the divine temple and
   the service which is too high for them, the all-holy ministers and
   loving contemplators of things all-holy, gazing reverently upon the
   most pure rite, sing in an universal Hymn of Praise [250] the Author
   and Giver of all good, from Whom the saving mystic Rites were exhibited
   to us, which divinely work the sacred deification of those being
   initiated. Now this Hymn some indeed call a Hymn of Praise, others, the
   symbol of worship, but others, as I think, more divinely, a
   Hierarchical thanksgiving, as giving a summary of the holy gifts which
   come to us from God. For, it seems to me the record [251] of all the
   works of God related to have been done for us in song, which, after it
   had benevolently fixed our being and life, and moulded the Divine
   likeness in ourselves to beautiful archetypes, and placed us in
   participation of a more Divine condition and elevation; but when it
   beheld the dearth of Divine gifts, which came upon us by our
   heedlessness, is declared to have called us back to our first
   condition, by goods restored, and by the complete assumption [252] of
   what was ours, to have made good the most perfect impartation of His
   own, and thus tp have given to us a participation in God and Divine
   things.

   Section VIII.

   When the supremely Divine love towards Man has thus been religiously
   celebrated, the Divine Bread is presented, veiled, and likewise the Cup
   of Blessing, and the most Divine greeting is devoutly performed, and
   the mystic and supermundane recital of the holy-written tablets. For it
   is not possible to be collected to the One, and to partake of the
   peaceful union with the One, when people are divided amongst
   themselves. For if, being illuminated by the contemplation and
   knowledge of the One, we would be united to an uniform and Divine
   agreement, we must not permit ourselves to descend to divided lusts,
   from which are formed earthly enmities, envious and passionate, against
   that which is according to nature. This unified and undivided life is,
   in my opinion, established by the holy service of the "peace," which
   establishes like in like, and separates the Divine and unified visions
   from things divided. The recital of the holy tablets after the "peace"
   proclaims those who have passed through life holily, and have reached
   the term of a virtuous life without faltering, urging and conducting us
   to their blessed condition and Divine repose, through similarity to
   them, and, announcing them as living, and, as the Word of God says,
   "not dead, but as having passed from death to a most divine life [253]
   ."

   Section IX.

   But observe that they are enrolled in the holy memorials, not as though
   the Divine memory were represented under the figure of a memorial,
   after the manner of men; but as one might say, with reverence towards
   God, as beseems the august and unfailing knowledge in God of those who
   have been perfected in the likeness of God. For "He knoweth," say the
   Oracles, "them that are His," and "precious, in the sight of the Lord,
   is the death of His saints, "death of saints," being said, instead of
   the perfection in holiness. And bear this religiously in mind, that
   when the worshipful symbols have been placed on the Divine Altar,
   through which (symbols) the Christ is signified and partaken, there is
   inseparably present the reading of the register of the holy persons,
   signifying the indivisible conjunction of their supermundane and sacred
   union with Him. When these things have been ministered, according to
   the regulations described, the Hierarch, standing before the most holy
   symbols, washes his hands with water, together with the reverend order
   of the Priests. Because, as the Oracles testify, when a man has been
   washed, he needs no other washing, except that of his extremities, i.e
   his lowest; through which extreme cleansing he will be resistless and
   free, as altogether uniform, in a sanctified habit of the Divine
   Likeness, and advancing in a goodly manner to things secondary, and
   being turned again uniquely to the One, he will make his return,
   without spot and blemish, as preserving the fulness and completeness of
   the Divine Likeness.

   Section X.

   There was indeed the sacred laver, as we have said, in the Hierarchy of
   the Law [254] ; and the present cleansing of the hands of the Hierarch
   and the Priests suggests it. For it behoves those who approach the most
   hallowed service to be purified even to the remotest imaginations of
   the soul, through likeness to it, and, as far as possible, to draw
   nigh; for thus they will shed around more visibly the Divine
   manifestations, since the supermundane flashes permit their own
   splendour to pass more thoroughly and brilliantly into the brightness
   of mirrors like themselves. Further, the cleansing of the Hierarch and
   the Priests to their extremities, i.e. lowest, takes place before the
   most holy symbols, as in the presence of Christ, Who surveys all our
   most secret thoughts, and since the utmost purification is established
   under His all-surveying scrutiny, and most just and unflinching
   judgment, the Hierarch thus becomes one with the things Divine, and,
   when he has extolled the holy works of God, he ministers things most
   Divine, and brings to view the things being sung [255] .

   Section XI.

   We will now explain, in detail, to the best of our ability, certain
   works of God, of which we spoke. For I am not competent to sing all,
   much less to know accurately, and to reveal their mysteries to others.
   Now whatever things have been sung and ministered by the inspired
   Hierarchs, agreeably to the Oracles, these we will declare, as far as
   attainable to us, invoking the Hierarchical inspiration to our aid.
   When, in the beginning, our human nature had thoughtlessly fallen from
   the good things of God, it received, by inheritance, the life subject
   to many passions, and the goal of the destructive death [256] . For, as
   a natural consequence, the pernicious falling away from genuine
   goodness and the transgression of the sacred Law in Paradise delivered
   the man fretted with the life-giving yoke, to his own downward
   inclinations and the enticing and hostile wiles of the adversary--the
   contraries of the divine goods; thence it pitiably exchanged for the
   eternal, the mortal, and, having had its own origin in deadly
   generations, the goal naturally corresponded with the beginning; but
   having willingly fallen from the Divine and elevating life, it was
   carried to the contrary extremity,--the variableness of many passions,
   and lead astray, and turned aside from the strait way leading to the
   true God,--and subjected to destructive and evil-working
   multitudes--naturally forgot that it was worshipping, not gods, or
   friends, but enemies. Now when these had treated it harshly, according
   to their own cruelty, it fell pitiably into danger of annihilation and
   destruction; but the boundless Loving-kindness of the supremely Divine
   goodness towards man did not, in Its benevolence, withdraw from us Its
   spontaneous forethought, but having truly participated sinlessly in all
   things belonging to us, and having been made one with our lowliness in
   connection with the unconfused and flawless possession of Its own
   properties in full perfection, It bequeathed to us, as henceforth
   members of the same family, the communion with Itself, and proclaimed
   us partakers of Its own beautiful things; having, as the secret
   teaching holds, loosed the power of the rebellious multiplicity, which
   was against us; not by force, as having the upper hand, but, according
   to the Logion, mystically transmitted to us, "in judgment and
   righteousness."

   The things within us, then, It benevolently changed to the entire
   contrary. For the lightless within Our mind It filled with blessed and
   most Divine Light, and adorned the formless with Godlike beauties; the
   tabernacle [257] of our soul It liberated from most damnable passions
   and destructive stains by a perfected deliverance of our being which
   was all but prostrate, by shewing to us a supermundane elevation, and
   an inspired polity in our religious assimilation to Itself, as far as
   is possible.

   Section XII.

   But how could the Divine imitation otherwise become ours, unless the
   remembrance of the most holy works of God were perpetually being
   renewed by the mystical teachings and ministrations of the Hierarchy?
   This, then, we do, as the Oracles say, "for Its remembrance." Wherefore
   the Divine Hierarch, standing before the Divine Altar, extols the
   aforesaid holy works of God, which proceed from the most divine
   forethought of Jesus on our behalf, which He accomplished for
   preservation of our race, by the good pleasure of the most Holy Father
   in the Holy Spirit, according to the Logion. When he has extolled their
   majesty, and gazed, with intellectual eyes, upon their intelligible
   contemplation, he proceeds to their symbolical ministration,--and
   this,--as transmitted from God. Whence after the holy hymns of the
   works of God, he piously and, as becomes a hierarch, deprecates his own
   unworthiness for a service above his merits, first, reverently crying
   aloud to Him, "Thou hast said, This do for My remembrance." Then, [258]
   having asked to become meet for this the God-imitating of service, and
   to consecrate things Divine by the assimilation to Christ Himself, and
   to distribute them altogether purely, and that those who shall partake
   of things holy may receive them holily, he consecrates things most
   Divine, and brings to view through the symbols reverently exposed the
   things whose praises are being sung. For when he has unveiled the
   veiled and undivided Bread, and divided it into many, and has divided
   the Oneness of the Cup to all, he symbolically multiplies and
   distributes the unity, completing in these an altogether most holy
   ministration. For the "one," and "simple," and "hidden," of Jesus, the
   most supremely Divine Word, by His incarnation amongst us, came forth,
   out of goodness and love towards man, to the compound and visible, and
   benevolently devised the unifying, communion, having united, to the
   utmost, our lowliness to the most Divine of Himself; if indeed we have
   been fitted to Him, as members to a body, after the identity of a
   blameless and Divine life, and have not, by being killed through
   destructive passions, become inharmonious, and unfastened, and unyoked,
   to the godly and most healthy members. For, if we aspire to communion
   with Him, we must keep our eye fixed upon His most godly Life in the
   flesh, and we must retrace our path to the Godlike and blameless habit
   of Its holy sinlessness by assimilation to It; for thus He will
   communicate harmoniously to us the communion with the similar.

   Section XIII.

   The Hierarch makes known these things to those who are living
   religiously, by bringing the veiled gifts to view, by dividing their
   oneness into many, and by making the recipients partakers of them, by
   the utmost union of the things distributed with those who receive them.
   For he delineates in these things under sensible forms our intelligible
   life in figures, by bringing to view the Christ Jesus from the Hidden
   within the Divine Being, out of love to man, made like unto us by the
   all-perfect and unconfused incarnation in our race, from us, and
   advancing to the divided condition of ourselves, without change from
   the essential One, and calling the human race, through this beneficent
   love of man, into participation with Himself and His own good things,
   provided we are united to His most Divine Life by our assimilation to
   it, as far as possible; and by this, in very truth, we shall have been
   perfected, as partakers of God and of Divine things.

   Section XIV.

   Having received and distributed the supremely Divine Communion, he
   terminates with a holy thanksgiving, in which the whole body of the
   Church take part. For the Communion precedes the imparting, and the
   reception of the mysteries, the mystic distribution. For this is the
   universal regulation and order of the Divine Mysteries, that the
   reverend Leader should first partake, and be filled with the gifts, to
   be imparted, through him, from God to others, and so impart to others
   also. Wherefore, those who rashly content themselves with the inspired
   instructions, in preference to a life and condition agreeable to the
   same, are profane, and entirely alien from the sacred regulation
   established. For, as in the case of the bright shining of the sun, the
   more delicate and luminous substances, being first filled with the
   brilliancy flowing into them, brightly impart their overflowing light
   to things after them; so it is not tolerable that one, who has not
   become altogether Godlike in his whole character, and proved to be in
   harmony with the Divine influence and judgment, should become Leader to
   others, in the altogether divine.

   Section XV.

   Meanwhile, the whole order of the Priests having been collected
   together in hierarchical order, and communicated in the most Divine
   mysteries, finishes with a holy thanksgiving, after having recognized
   and sung the favours of the works of God, according to their degree. So
   that those, who have not partaken and are ignorant of things Divine,
   would not attain to thanksgiving, although the most Divine gifts are,
   in their essential nature, worthy of thanksgiving. But, as I said, not
   having wished even to look at the Divine gifts, from their inclination
   to things inferior, they have remained throughout ungracious towards
   the boundless graces of the works of God. "Taste and see," say the
   Oracles, for, by the sacred initiation of things Divine, the initiated
   recognize their munificent graces, and, by gazing with utmost reverence
   upon their most Divine height and breadth in the participation, they
   will sing the supercelestial beneficent works of the Godhead with
   gracious thanksgiving.

  CAPUT IV.

   I. Concerning things performed in the Muron, and concerning things
   perfected in it.

   So great and so beautiful are the intelligible visions of the most holy
   Synaxis, which minister hierarchically, as we have often said, our
   participation in, and collection towards, the One. But there is another
   perfecting Service of the same rank, which our Leaders name "Initiation
   of Muron," by contemplating whose parts in due order, in accordance
   with the sacred images, we shall thus be borne, by hierarchical
   contemplations, to its Oneness through its parts.

   II. Mysterion of Initiation of Muron [259] .

   In the same way as in the Synaxis, the orders of the imperfect are
   dismissed, that is, after the hierarchical procession has made the
   whole circuit of the temple, attended with fragrant incense; and the
   chanting of the Psalms, and.the reading of the most Divine Oracles.
   Then the Hierarch takes the Muron and places it, veiled under twelve
   sacred wings, upon the Divine Altar, whilst all cry aloud, with most
   devout voice, the sacred melody of the inspiration of the God-rapt
   Prophets, and when he has finished the prayer offered over it, he uses
   it, in the most holy mystic Rites of things being hallowed, for almost
   every Hierarchical consecration.

   III. Contemplation.

   Section I.

   The elementary teaching, then, of this the perfecting service, through
   the things done over the Divine Muron, shews this, in my judgment,
   that, that which is holy and of sweet savour in the minds of devout men
   is covered, as with a veil, since it Divinely enjoins upon holy men to
   have their beautiful and well-savoured assimilations in virtue to the
   hidden God not seen for vain glory. For the hidden comeliness of God is
   unsullied, and is sweet beyond conception, and manifested for spiritual
   contemplation to the intellectual alone, through a desire to have the
   unsullied images of virtue in souls of the same pattern. For by looking
   away from the undistorted and well imitated image of the Godlike virtue
   to that contemplated and fragrant beauty, he thus moulds and fashions
   it to the most beautiful imitation. And, as in the case of sensible
   images, if the artist look without distraction upon the archetypal
   form, not distracted by sight of anything else, or in any way divided
   in attention, he will duplicate, if I may so speak, the very person
   that is being sketched, whoever he may be, and will shew the reality in
   the likeness, and the archetype in the image, and each in each, save
   the difference of substance; thus, to copyists who love the beautiful
   in mind, the persistent and unflinching contemplation of the
   sweet-savoured and hidden beauty will confer the unerring and most
   Godlike appearance [260] . Naturally, then, the divine copyists, who
   unflinchingly mould their own intellectual contemplation to the
   superessentially sweet and contemplated comeliness, do. none of their
   divinely imitated virtues "to be seen of men [261] , as the Divine text
   expresses it; but reverently gaze upon the most holy things of the
   Church, veiled in the Divine Muron as in a figure. Wherefore, these
   also, by religiously concealing that which is holy and most Divine in
   virtue within their Godlike and God-engraved mind, look away to the
   archetypal conception alone; for not only are they blind to things
   dissimilar, but neither are they drawn down to gaze upon them.
   Wherefore, as becomes their character, they do neither love things,
   merely seeming good and just, but those really being such; nor do they
   look to opinion, upon which the multitude irrationally congratulate
   themselves, but, after the Divine example, by distinguishing the good
   or evil as it is in itself, they are Divine images of the most
   supremely Divine sweetness, which, having the truly sweet within
   itself, is not turned to the anomalously seeming of the multitude,
   moulding Its genuineness to the true images of Itself.

   Section II.

   Come, then, since we have viewed the exterior comeliness of the
   entirely beautiful ministration, let us now look away to its more godly
   beauty (whilst itself, by itself, has uncovered the veils), gazing upon
   its blessed radiance, shedding its bright beams openly around, and
   filling us with the fragrance unveiled to the contemplators. For the
   visible consecration of the Muron is neither uncommunicated in, or
   unseen by those who surround the Hierarch, but, on the contrary, by
   passing through to them, and fixing the contemplation above the many,
   is reverently covered by them, and by Hierarchical direction kept from
   the multitude.

   For the splendour of things all holy, by shedding its light clearly and
   without symbol to men inspired, as being congenial to the thing
   contemplated, and perfuming their contemplating perceptions without;
   concealment, advances not yet in the same way to the inferior, but by
   them as deep contemplators of the thing contemplated is concealed under
   the enigmas of the wings, without ostentation, so that it may not be
   defiled by the dissimilar; through which sacred enigmas the
   well-ordered Ranks of the subordinate are conducted to the degree of
   holiness compatible with their powers.

   Section III.

   The holy consecration, then, which we are now extolling, is, as I said,
   of the perfecting rank and capacity of the Hierarchical functions.
   Wherefore our Divine Leaders arranged the same, as being of the same
   rank and effect as the holy perfecting of the Synaxis, with the same
   figures, for the most part, and with mystical regulations and lections.
   And you may see in like manner the Hierarch bearing forward the sweet
   perfume from the more holy place into the sacred precincts beyond, and
   teaching, by the return to the same, that the participation in things
   Divine comes to all holy persons, according to fitness, and is
   undiminished and altogether unmoved and stands unchangeably in its
   identity, as beseems Divine fixity. In the same way the Psalms and
   readings of the Oracles nurse the imperfect to a life-bringing adoption
   of sons, and form a religious inclination in those who are possessed
   with accursed spirits, and dispel the opposing fear and effeminacy from
   those possessed by a spirit of unmanliness; shewing to them, according
   to their capacity, the highest pinnacle of the Godlike habit and power,
   by aid of which they will, the rather, scare away the opposing forces,
   and will take the lead in healing others; and, following the example of
   God, they will, whilst unmoved from their own proper gifts, not only be
   active against those opposing fears, but will themselves give activity
   to others; and they also impart a religious habit to those who have
   changed from the worse to a religious mind, so that they should not be
   again enslaved by evil, and purify completely those who need to become
   altogether pure; and they lead the holy to the Divine likenesses, and
   contemplations and communions belonging to themselves, and so establish
   those who are entirely holy, in blessed and intelligible visions,
   fulfilling their uniform likeness of the One, and making them one.

   Section IV.

   What, then, shall I say further? Is it not those Ranks already
   mentioned, which are not entirely pure, that the present consecrating
   service excludes without distinction, in the same way as the Synaxis,
   so that it is viewed by the holy alone, in figures, and is contemplated
   and ministered, by the perfectly holy alone, immediately, through
   hierarchical directions? Now it is superfluous, as I think, to run
   over, by the same statements, these things already so often mentioned,
   and not to pass to the next, viewing the Hierarch, devoutly holding the
   Divine Muron veiled under twelve wings, and ministering the altogether
   holy consecration upon it. Let us then affirm that the composition of
   the Muron is a composition of sweet-smelling materials, which has in
   itself abundantly fragrant qualities, of which (composition) those who
   partake become perfumed in proportion to the degree to which they
   partake of its sweet savour. Now we are persuaded that the most
   supremely Divine Jesus is superessentially of good savour, filling the
   contemplative part of ourselves by bequests of Divine sweetness for
   contemplation. For if the reception of the sensible odours make to feel
   joyous, and nourishes, with much sweetness, the sensitive organs of our
   nostrils, --if at least they be sound and well apportioned to the sweet
   savour--in the same way any one might say that our contemplative
   faculties, being soundly disposed as regards the subjection to the
   worse, in the strength of the distinguishing faculty implanted in us by
   nature, receive the supremely Divine fragrance, and are filled with a
   holy comfort and most Divine nourishment, in accordance with Divinely
   fixed proportions, and the correlative turning of the mind towards the
   Divine Being. Wherefore, the symbolical composition of the Muron, as
   expressing in form things that are formless, depicts to us Jesus
   Himself, as a well-spring of the wealth of the Divine sweet receptions,
   distributing, in degrees supremely Divine, for the most Godlike of the
   contemplators, the most Divine perfumes; upon which the Minds, joyfully
   refreshed, and filled with the holy receptions, indulge in a feast of
   spiritual contemplation, by the entrance of the sweet bequests into
   their contemplative part, as beseems a Divine participation.

   Section V.

   Now it is evident, as I think, that the distribution of the fontal
   perfume to the Beings above ourselves, who are more Divine, is, as it
   were, nearer, and manifests and distributes itself more to the
   transparent and wholesome mental condition of their receptive faculty,
   overflowing ungrudgingly and entering in many fashions; but as regards
   the subordinate contemplators, which are not so receptive, piously
   concealing the highest vision and participation, it is distributed in a
   supremely Divine proportion, in fragrance corresponding to the
   recipients. Amongst the holy Beings, then, who are above us, the
   superior order of the Seraphim is represented under the figure of the
   twelve wings, established and fixed around Jesus, casting itself upon
   the most blessed contemplations of Him, as far as permissible, and
   filled reverently with the contemplated truth distributed in most pure
   receptions, and, to speak after the manner of men, crying aloud, with
   never silent lips, the frequent Hymn of Praise; for the sacred
   knowledge of the supermundane minds is both untiring, and possesses the
   Divine love without intermission, and is at the same time superior to
   all baseness and forgetfulness. Hence, as I think, that phrase,
   "unceasing cry," suggests their perpetual and persistent science and
   conception of things Divine, with full concord and thanksgiving.

   Section VI.

   Now we have, as I think, sufficiently contemplated, in the description
   of the super-heavenly Hierarchy, the incorporeal properties of the
   Seraphim, Divinely described in the Scriptures under sensible figures
   explanatory of the contemplated Beings, and we have made them evident
   to thy contemplating eyes. Nevertheless, since now also they who stand
   reverently around the Hierarch, reflect the highest Order, on a small
   scale, we will now view with most immaterial visions their most Godlike
   splendour.

   Section VII.

   Their numberless faces then, and many feet, manifest, as I think, their
   property of viewing the most Divine illuminations from many sides, and
   their conception of the good things of God as ever active and
   abundantly receptive; and the sixfold arrangement of the wings, of
   which the Scripture speaks, does not, I think, denote, as seems to
   some, a sacred number, but that of the highest Essence and Order around
   God; the first and middle and last of its contemplative and Godlike
   powers are altogether elevating, free, and supermundane. Hence the most
   holy wisdom of the Oracles, when reverently describing the formation of
   the wings, places the wings around their heads [262] , and middle, and
   feet; suggesting their complete covering with wings, and their manifold
   faculty of leading to the Really Being.

   Section VIII.

   Now if they cover their faces and their feet, and fly by their middle
   wings only, bear this reverently in mind, that the Order, so far
   exalted above the highest beings, is circumspect respecting the more
   lofty and deep of its conceptions, and raises itself, in due
   proportion, by its middle wings, to the vision of God, by placing its
   own proper life under the Divine yokes, and by these is reverently
   directed to the judgment of itself.

   Section IX.

   And, as regards the statement of Holy Scripture, that "one cried out to
   the other," that shews, I think, that they impart to each other
   ungrudgingly their own visions of God. And this we should deem worthy
   of religious recollection, that the Hebrew word in the Holy Scriptures
   names the most holy Beings of the Seraphim by an explanatory epithet,
   from their glowing and seething in a Divine and ever-moving life.

   Section X.

   Since, then, as those who understand Hebrew say, the most Divine
   Seraphim were named by the Word of God, "Kindling" and "Heating," by a
   name expressive of their essential condition, they possess, according
   to the symbolical imagery of the Divine Muron, most elevating powers,
   which call it to manifestation and distribution of most exhilarating
   perfumes. For the Being, sweet beyond conception, loves to be moved by
   the glowing and most pure minds into manifestation, and imparts Its
   most Divine inspirations, in cheerful distributions, to those who thus
   supermundanely call It forth. Thus the most Divine Order of
   supercelestial Beings did not fail to recognize the most supremely
   Divine Jesus, when He descended for the purpose of being sanctified;
   but recognizes, reverently, Him lowering Himself in our belongings,
   through Divine and inexpressible goodness; and when viewing Him
   sanctified, in a manner befitting man, by the Father and Himself and
   the Holy Spirit, recognized its own supreme Head as being essentially
   unchanged, in whatever He may do as supreme God. Hence the tradition of
   the sacred symbols places the Seraphim near the Divine Muron, when it
   is being consecrated, recognizing and describing the Christ as
   unchanged, in our complete manhood in very truth. And what is still
   more divine is, that it uses the Divine Muron for the consecration of
   every thing sacred, distinctly shewing, according to the Logion, the
   Sanctified Sanctifying, as always being the same with Himself
   throughout the whole supremely Divine sanctification. Wherefore also
   the consecrating gift and grace of the Divine Birth in God is completed
   in the most Divine perfectings of the Muron. Whence, as I think, the
   Hierarch pouring the Muron upon the purifying font in cruciform
   injections, brings to view, for contemplative eyes, the Lord Jesus
   descending even to death itself through the cross, for our Birth in
   God, benevolently drawing up, from the old gulping of the destructive
   death, by the same Divine and resistless descent, those, who, according
   to the mysterious saying, "are baptized into His death," and renewing
   them to a godly and eternal existence.

   Section XI.

   But further, the perfecting unction of the Muron gives to him who has
   been initiated in the most sacred initiation of the Birth in God, the
   abiding of the supremely Divine Spirit; the sacred imagery of the
   symbols, portraying, as I think, the most Divine Spirit abundantly
   supplied by Him, Who, for our sakes, has been sanctified as man by the
   supremely Divine Spirit, in an unaltered condition of His essential
   Godhead.

   Section XII.

   And bear this also hierarchically in mind, that the Law of the most
   pure initiation completes the sacred consecration of the Divine Altar,
   by the all pure effusions of the most holy Muron. And the
   supercelestial and superessential contemplation is source and essence,
   and perfecting power, of all our deifying holiness. For if our most
   Divine Altar is Jesus--the supremely Divine sanctifying of the Godly
   Minds --in Whom, according to the Logion, "being sanctified and
   mystically offered as a whole burnt-offering, we have the access," let
   us gaze with supermundane eyes upon the most Divine Altar itself (in
   which things being perfected, are perfected and sanctified), being
   perfected from the most Divine Muron itself; for the altogether most
   holy Jesus sanctifies Himself on our behalf, and fills us full of every
   sanctification, since the things consecrated upon them pass fraternally
   afterwards in their beneficent effects to us, as children of God.
   Hence, as I think, the Divine Leaders of our Hierarchy, in conformity
   with a Hierarchical conception divinely transmitted, name this
   altogether august ministration "consecration of Muron," from "being
   consecrated thoroughly," as one might say, "consecration of God,"
   extolling its divine consecrating work in each sense. For both the
   being sanctified for our sakes, as becomes Man, and the consecrating
   all things as supreme God, and the sanctifying things being
   consecrated, is "consecration of Him." As for the sacred song of the
   inspiration of the God-rapt Prophets, it is called by those who know
   Hebrew, the "Praise of God," or "Praise ye the Lord," for since every
   divine manifestation and work of God is reverently portrayed in the
   varied composition of the Hierarchical symbols, it is not unfitting to
   mention the Divinely moved song of the Prophets; for it teaches at
   once, distinctly and reverently, that the beneficent works of the
   Divine Goodness are worthy of devout praise.

  CAPUT V.

   I. Concerning sacerdotal Consecrations.

   Section I.

   Such, then, is the most Divine perfecting work of the Muron But it may
   be opportune, after these Divine ministrations, to set forth the
   sacerdotal Orders and elections themselves, and their powers, and
   operations, and consecrations, and the triad of the superior ranks
   under them; in order that the arrangement of our Hierarchy may be
   demonstrated, as entirely rejecting and excluding the disordered, the
   unregulated, and the confused; and, at the same time, choosing and
   manifesting the regulated and ordered, and well-established, in the
   gradations of the sacred Ranks within it. Now we have well shewn, as I
   think, in the Hierarchies already extolled by us, the threefold
   division of every Hierarchy, when we affirmed that our sacred tradition
   holds, that every Hierarchical transaction is divided into the most
   Divine Mystic Rites, and the inspired experts and teachers of them, and
   those who are being religiously initiated by them.

   Section II.

   Thus the most holy Hierarchy of the supercelestial Beings has, for its
   initiation, its own possible and most immaterial conception of God and
   things Divine, and the complete likeness to God, and a persistent habit
   of imitating God, as far as permissible. And its illuminators, and
   leaders to this sacred consecration, are the very first Beings around
   God. For these generously and proportionately transmit to the
   subordinate sacred Ranks the ever deifying notions given to them, by
   the self-perfect Godhead and the wise-making Divine Minds. Now the
   Ranks, who are subordinate to the first Beings, are, and are truly
   called, the initiated Orders, as being religiously conducted, through
   those, to the deifying illumination of the Godhead. And after
   this,--the heavenly and supermundane Hierarchy,--the Godhead gave the
   Hierarchy under the Law, imparting its most holy gifts, for the benefit
   of our race, to them (as being children according to the Logion), by
   faint images of the true, and copies far from the Archetypes, and
   enigmas hard to understand, and types having the contemplation
   enveloped within, as an analogous light not easily discerned, so as not
   to wound weak, eyes by the light shed upon them. Now to this Hierarchy
   under the Law, the elevation to spiritual worship is an initiation. Now
   the men religiously instructed for that holy tabernacle by Moses,--the
   first initiated and leader of the Hierarchs under the Law,--were
   conductors; in reference to which holy tabernacle,--when describing for
   purposes of instruction the Hierarchy under the Law,--he called all the
   sacred services of the Law an image of the type shewn to him in Mount
   Sinai. But "initiated" are those who are being conducted to a more
   perfect revelation of the symbols of the Law, in proportion to their
   capacity. Now the Word of God calls our Hierarchy the more perfect
   revelation, naming it a fulfilment of that, and a holy inheritance. It
   is both heavenly and legal, like the mean between extremes, common to
   the one, by intellectual contemplations, and to the other, because it
   is variegated by sensible signs; and, through these, reverently
   conduces to the Divine Being. And it has likewise a threefold division
   of the Hierarchy, which is divided into the most holy ministrations of
   the Mystic Rites, and into the Godlike ministers of holy things, and
   those who are being conducted by them, according to their capacity, to
   things holy.

   And each of the three divisions of our Hierarchy, comformably to that
   of the Law, and the Hierarchy, more divine than ours, is arranged as
   first and middle and last in power; consulting both reverent
   proportion, and well-ordered and concordant fellowship of all things in
   harmonious rank.

   Section III.

   The most holy ministration, then, of the Mystic Rites has, as first
   Godlike power, the holy cleansing of the uninitiated; and as middle,
   the enlightening instruction of the purified; and as last, and summary
   of the former, the perfecting of those instructed in science of their
   proper instructions; and the order of the Ministers, in the first
   power, cleanses the uninitiated through the Mystic Rites; and in the
   second, conducts to light the purified; and in the last and highest of
   the Ministering Powers, makes perfect those who have participated in
   the Divine light, by the scientific completions of the illuminations
   contemplated. And of the Initiated, the first power is that being
   purified; and the middle is that being enlightened, after the
   cleansing, and which contemplates certain holy things; and the last and
   more divine than the others, is that enlightened in the perfecting
   science of the holy enlightenment of which it has become a
   contemplator. Let, then, the threefold power of the holy service of the
   Mystic Rites be extolled, since the Birth in God is exhibited in the
   Oracles as a purification and enlightening illumination, and the Rite
   of the Synaxis and the Muron, as a perfecting knowledge and science of
   the works of God, through which the unifying elevation to the Godhead
   and most blessed communion is reverently perfected. And now let us
   explain next the sacerdotal Order, which is divided into a purifying
   and illuminating and perfecting discipline.

   Section IV.

   This, then, is the all-sacred Law of the Godhead, that, through the
   first, the second are conducted to Its most Divine splendour. Do we not
   see the material substances of the elements, first approaching, by
   preference, things which are more congenial to them, and, through
   these, diffusing their own energy to other things? Naturally, then, the
   Head and Foundation of all good order, invisible and visible, causes
   the deifying rays to approach the more Godlike first, and through them,
   as being more transparent Minds, and more properly adapted for
   reception and transmission of Light, transmits light and manifestations
   to the subordinate, in proportions suitable to them.

   It is, then, the function of these, the first contemplators of God, to
   exhibit ungrudgingly to those second, in proportion to their capacity,
   the Divine visions reverently gazed upon by themselves, and to reveal
   the things relating to the Hierarchy (since they have been abundantly
   instructed with a perfecting science in all matters relating to their
   own Hierarchy, and have received the effectual power of instruction),
   and to impart sacred gifts according to fitness, since they
   scientifically and wholly participate in sacerdotal perfection.

   Section V.

   The Divine Rank of the Hierarchs, then, is the first of the
   God-contemplative Ranks; and it is, at the same time, highest and
   lowest; inasmuch as every Order of our Hierarchy is summed up and
   fulfilled in it. For, as we see every Hierarchy terminated in the Lord
   Jesus, so we see each terminated in its own inspired Hierarch. Now the
   power of the Hierarchical Rank permeates the whole sacred body, and
   through every one of the sacred Ranks performs the mysteries of its
   proper Hierarchy. But, pre-eminently, to it, rather than to the other
   Ranks, the Divine institution assigned the more Divine ministrations.
   For these are the perfecting images of the supremely Divine Power,
   completing all the most Divine symbols and all the sacred orderings.
   For though some of the worshipful symbols are consecrated by the
   Priests, yet never will the Priest effect the holy Birth in God without
   the most Divine Muron; nor will he consecrate the mysteries of the
   Divine Communion, unless the communicating symbols have been placed
   upon the most Divine Altar; and neither will he be Priest himself,
   unless he has been elected to this by the Hierarchical consecrations.
   Hence the Divine Institution uniquely assigned the dedication of the
   Hierarchical Ranks, and the consecration of the Divine Muron and the
   sacred completion of the Altar, to the perfecting powers of the
   inspired Hierarchs.

   Section VI.

   It is, then, the Hierarchical Rank which, full of the perfecting power,
   pre-eminently completes the perfecting functions of the Hierarchy, and
   reveals lucidly the sciences of the holy mysteries, and teaches their
   proportionate and sacred conditions and powers. But the illuminating
   Rank of the Priests conducts those, who are being initiated under the
   Rank of, the inspired Hierarchs, to the Divine visions of the Mystic
   Rites, and in co-operation with it, ministers its proper ministrations.
   Whatever then this Rank may do, by shewing the works of God, through
   the most holy symbols, and perfecting those who draw nigh in the Divine
   contemplations, and communion of the holy rites, it yet refers those,
   who crave the science of the religious services contemplated, to the
   Hierarch. And the Rank of the Leitourgoi (which is purifying and
   separates the unfit, previous to the approach to the ministrations of
   the Priests), thoroughly purifies those who are drawing nigh, by making
   them entirely pure from opposing passions, and suitable for the
   sanctifying vision and communion. Hence, during the service of the
   Birth in God, the Leitourgoi strip him who draws nigh of his old
   clothing, yea further, even take off his sandals, and make him stand
   towards the west for renunciation; and again, they lead him back to the
   east (for they are of the purifying rank and power), enjoining on those
   who approach to entirely cast away the surroundings of their former
   life, and shewing the darkness of their former conduct, and teaching
   those, who have said farewell to the lightless, to transfer their
   allegiance to the luminous. The Leitourgical Order, then, is purifying,
   by leading those who have been purified to the bright ministrations of
   the Priests, both by thoroughly purifying the uninitiated and by
   bringing to birth, by the purifying illuminations and teachings of the
   Oracles, and further, by sending away from the Priests the unholy,
   without respect of persons. Wherefore also the Hierarchical institution
   places it at the holy gates, suggesting that the approach of those who
   draw nigh to holy things should be in altogether complete purification,
   and entrusting the approach to their reverent vision and communion to
   the purifying powers, and admitting them, through these, without spot.

   Section VII.

   We have shewn, then, that the Rank of the Hierarchs is consecrating and
   perfecting, that of the Priests, illuminating and conducting to the
   light; and that of the Leitourgoi purifying and discriminating; that is
   to say, the Hierarchical Rank is appointed not only to perfect, but
   also at the same time, to enlighten and to purify, and has within
   itself the purifying sciences of the power of the Priests together with
   the illuminating. For the inferior Ranks cannot cross to the superior
   functions, and, besides this, it is not permitted to them to take in
   hand such quackery as that. Now the more Divine Orders know also,
   together with their own, the sacred sciences subordinate to their own
   perfection. Nevertheless, since the sacerdotal orderings of the
   well-arranged and unconfused order of the Divine operations are images
   of Divine operations, they were arranged in Hierarchical distinctions,
   shewing in themselves the illuminations marshalled into the first, and
   middle, and last, sacred operations and Ranks; manifesting, as I said,
   in themselves the well-ordered and unconfused character of the Divine
   operations. For since the Godhead first cleanses the minds which He may
   enter, then enlightens, and, when enlightened, perfects them to a
   Godlike perfection; naturally the Hierarchical of the Divine images
   divides itself into well-defined Ranks and powers, shewing clearly the
   supremely Divine operation firmly established, without confusion, in
   most hallowed and unmixed Ranks. But, since we have spoken, as
   attainable to us, of the sacerdotal Ranks and elections, and their
   powers and operations, let us now contemplate their most holy
   consecrations as well as we can.

   II. Mysterion of Sacerdotal Consecrations.

   The Hierarch, then, being led to the Hierarchical consecration, after
   he has bent both his knees before the Altar, has upon his head [263]
   the God-transmitted oracles, and the Hierarchical hand, and in this
   manner is consecrated by the Hierarch, who ordains him by the
   altogether most holy invocations. And the Priest, after he has bent
   both his knees before the Divine Altar, has the Hierarchical right hand
   upon his head, and in this manner is dedicated by the Hierarch, who
   ordains him with hallowing invocations. And the Leitourgos, after he
   has bent one of two knees before the Divine Altar, has upon his head
   the right hand of the Hierarch who ordains him, being completed by him
   with the initiating invocations of the Leitourgoi. Upon each of them
   the cruciform seal is impressed, by the ordaining Hierarch, and, in
   each case, a sacred proclamation of name takes place, and a perfecting
   salutation, since every sacerdotal person present, and the Hierarch who
   ordained, salute him who has been enrolled to any of the aforenamed
   sacerdotal Ranks.

   III. Contemplation.

   Section I.

   These things, then, are common both to the Hierarchs, and Priests, and
   Leitourgoi, in their sacerdotal consecrations,--the conducting to the
   Divine Altar and kneeling,--the imposition of the Hierarchical
   hand,--the cruciform seal,--the announcement of name,--the completing
   salutation.

   And special and select for the Hierarchs is the imposition of the
   Oracles upon the head, since the subordinate Ranks have not this; and
   for the Priests the bending of both knees, since the consecration of
   the Leitourgoi has not this; for the Leitourgoi, as has been said, bend
   the one of two knees only.

   Section II.

   The conducting then to the Divine Altar, and kneeling, suggests to all
   those who are being sacerdotally ordained, that their own life is
   entirely placed under God, as source of consecration, and that their
   whole intellectual self, all pure and hallowed, approaches to Him, and
   that it is of one likeness, and, as far as possible, meet for the
   supremely Divine and altogether most holy, both Victim [264] and Altar,
   which purifies, sacerdotally, the Godlike Minds.

   Section III.

   And the imposition of the Hierarchical hand signifies at once the
   consecrating protection, by which, as holy children, they are
   paternally tended, which bequeaths to them a sacerdotal condition and
   power, and drives away their adverse powers, and teaches, at the same
   time also, to perform the sacerdotal operations, as those who, having
   been consecrated, are acting under God, and have Him as Leader of their
   own operations in every respect.

   Section IV.

   And the cruciform seal manifests the inaction of all the impulses of
   the flesh, and the God-imitated life looking away unflinchingly to the
   manly most Divine life of Jesus, Who came even to Cross and death with
   a supremely Divine sinlessness, and stamped those who so live with the
   cruciform image of His own sinlessness as of the same likeness.

   Section V.

   And the Hierarch calls aloud the name of the consecrations and of those
   consecrated, the mystery denoting that the God-beloved consecrator is
   manifestor of the supremely Divine choice,--not of his own accord or by
   his own favour leading those who are ordained to the sacerdotal
   consecration, but being moved by God to all the Hierarchical
   dedications. Thus Moses, the consecrator under the Law, does not lead
   even Aaron, his brother, to sacerdotal consecration, though thinking
   him both beloved of God and fit for the priesthood, until moved by God
   to this, he in submission to God, Head of consecration, completed by
   Hierarchical rites the sacerdotal consecration. But even our supremely
   Divine and first Consecrator (for the most philanthropic Jesus, for our
   sake, became even this), did "not glorify Himself," as the Logia say,
   but He Who said to Him, "Thou art Priest for ever after the order of
   Melchizedek." Wherefore also whilst Himself leading the disciples to
   sacerdotal consecration, although being as God chief Consecrator,
   nevertheless He refers the Hierarchical completion of the work of
   consecration to His altogether most Holy Father, and the supremely
   Divine Spirit, by admonishing the disciples, as the Oracles say, not to
   depart from Jerusalem, but to "await the promise of the Father, which
   ye heard of Me, that ye shall be baptized in Holy Ghost." And indeed,
   the Coryphaeus of the disciples himself, with the ten, of the same rank
   and Hierarchy with himself, when he proceeded to the sacerdotal
   consecration of the twelfth of the disciples, piously left the
   selection to the Godhead, saying, "Shew [265] whom Thou hast chosen,"
   and received him, who was divinely designated by the Divine lot, into
   the Hierarchical number of the sacred twelve. Now concerning the Divine
   lot, which fell as a Divine intimation upon Matthias, others have
   expressed another view, not clearly, as I think, but I will express my
   own sentiment. For it seems to me that the Oracles name "lot " a
   certain supremely Divine gift, pointing out to that Hierarchical Choir
   him who was designated by the Divine election; more particularly,
   because the Divine Hierarch must not perform the sacerdotal acts of his
   own motion, but, under God, moving him to do them as prescribed by the
   Hierarchy and Heaven.

   Section VI.

   Now the salutation, for the completion of the sacerdotal consecration,
   has a religious significance. For all the members of the sacerdotal
   Ranks present, as well as the Hierarch himself who has consecrated
   them, salute the ordained. For when, by sacerdotal habits and powers,
   and by Divine call and dedication, a religious mind has attained to
   sacerdotal completion, he is dearly loved by the most holy Orders of
   the same rank, being conducted to a most Godlike comeliness, loving the
   minds similar to himself, and religiously loved by them in return.
   Hence it is that the mutual sacerdotal salutation is religiously
   performed, proclaiming the religious communion of minds of like
   character, and their loveable benignity towards each other, as keeping,
   throughout, by sacerdotal training, their most Godlike comeliness.

   Section VII

   These things, as I said, are common to the whole sacerdotal
   consecration. The Hierarch, however, as a distinctive mark, has the
   Oracles most reverently placed upon his head. For since the perfecting
   power and science of the whole Priesthood is bequeathed to the inspired
   Hierarchs, by the supremely Divine and perfecting goodness, naturally
   are placed upon the heads of the Hierarchs the Divinely transmitted
   Oracles, which set forth comprehensively and scientifically every
   teaching of God, work of God, manifestation of God, sacred word, sacred
   work, in one word, all the Divine and sacred works and words bequeathed
   to our Hierarchy by the beneficent Godhead; since the Godlike Hierarch,
   having participated entirely in the whole Hierarchical power, will not
   only be illuminated, in the true and God-transmitted science of all the
   sacred words and works committed to the Hierarchy, but will also
   transmit them to others in Hierarchical proportions, and will perfect
   Hierarchically in most Divine kinds of knowledge and the highest
   mystical, instructions, all the most perfecting functions of the whole
   Hierarchy. And the distinctive feature of the ordination of Priests, as
   contrasted with the ordering of the Leitourgoi, is the bending of the
   two knees, as that bends only the one, and is ordained in this
   Hierarchical fashion.

   Section VIII.

   The bending then denotes the subordinate introduction of the conductor,
   who places under God that which is reverently introduced. And since, as
   we have often said, the three Orders of the consecrators, through the
   three most holy Mystic Rites and powers, preside over the three ranks
   of those initiated, and minister their saving introduction under the
   Divine yokes, naturally the order of Leitourgoi as only purifying,
   ministers the one introduction of those who are being purified, by
   placing it under the Divine Altar, since in it the minds being
   purified, are supermundanely hallowed. And the Priests bend both their
   knees, since those who are religiously brought nigh by them have not
   only been purified, but have been ministerially perfected into a
   contemplative habit and power of a life thoroughly cleansed by their
   most luminous, ministrations through instruction. And the Hierarchy
   bending both his knees, has upon his head the God-transmitted Oracles,
   leading, through his office of Hierarch, those who have been purified
   by the Leitourgic power, and enlightened by the ministerial, to the
   science of the holy things contemplated by them in proportion to their
   capacities, and through this science perfecting those who are brought
   nigh, into the most complete holiness of which they are capable.

  CAPUT VI.

   I. Concerning the Ranks of the Initiated.

   Section I.

   These, then, are the sacerdotal Ranks and elections, their powers, and
   operations, and consecrations. We must next explain the triad of the
   Ranks being initiated under them. We affirm then that the multitudes,
   of whom we have already made mention, who are dismissed from the
   ministrations and consecrations, are Ranks under purification; since
   one is being yet moulded and fashioned by the Leitourgoi through the
   obstetric Oracles to a living birth; and another is yet to be called
   back to the holy life, from which it had departed, by the hortatory
   teaching of the good Oracles; and another, as being yet terrorized,
   through want of manliness, by opposing fears, and being fortified by
   the strengthening Oracles; and another, as being yet led back from the
   worse to holy efforts; and another as having been led back, indeed, but
   not yet having a chaste fixedness in more Godlike and tranquil habits.
   For these are the Orders under purification, by the nursing and
   purifying power of the Leitourgoi. These, the Leitourgoi perfect, by
   their sacred powers, for the purpose of their being brought, after
   their complete cleansing, to the enlightening contemplation and
   participation in the most luminous ministrations.

   Section II.

   And a middle rank is the contemplative, which participates in certain
   Divine Offices in all purity, according to its capacity, which is
   assigned to the Priests for its enlightenment.

   For it is evident, in my opinion, that, that having been cleansed from
   all unholy impurity, and having acquired the pure and unmoved
   steadfastness of its own mind, is led back, ministerially, to the
   contemplative habit and power, and communicates the most Divine
   symbols, according to its capability, filled with every holy joy in
   their contemplations and communions, mounting gradually to the Divine
   love of their science, through their elevating powers. This, I affirm,
   is the rank of the holy people, as having passed through complete
   purification, and deemed worthy, as far as is lawful, both of the
   reverent vision, and participation of the most luminous Mystic Rites.

   Section III.

   Now the rank, higher than all the initiated, is the sacred Order of the
   Monks, which, by reason of an entirely purified purification, through
   complete power and perfect chastity of its own operations, has attained
   to intellectual contemplation and communion in every ministration which
   it is lawful for it to contemplate, and is conducted by the most
   perfecting powers of the Hierarchs, and taught by their inspired
   illuminations and hierarchical traditions the ministrations of the
   Mystic Rites, contemplated, according to its capacity, and elevated by
   their sacred science, to the most perfecting perfection of which it is
   capable. Hence our Divine leaders have deemed them worthy of sacred
   appellations, some, indeed, calling them "Therapeutae," and others
   "Monks," from the pure service and fervid devotion to the true God, and
   from the undivided and single life, as it were unifying them, in the
   sacred enfoldings of things divided, into a God-like Monad, and
   God-loving perfection. Wherefore the Divine institution accorded them a
   consecrating grace, and deemed them worthy of a certain hallowing
   invocation--not hierarchical--for that is confined to the sacerdotal
   orders alone, but ministrative, as being ministered, by the pious
   Priests, by the hierarchial consecration in the second degree.

   II. Mysterion on Monastic Consecration.

   The Priest then stands before the Divine Altar, religiously pronouncing
   the invocation for Monks. The ordinand stands behind the Priest,
   neither bending both knees, nor one of them, nor having upon his head
   the Divinely-transmitted Oracles, but only standing near the Priest,
   who pronounces over him the mystical invocation. When the Priest has
   finished this, he approaches the ordinand, and asks him first, if he
   bids farewell to all the distracted--not lives only, but also
   imaginations. Then he sets before him the most perfect life, testifying
   that it is his bounden duty to surpass the ordinary life. When the
   ordinand has promised steadfastly all these things, the Priest, after
   he has sealed him with the sign of the Cross, crops his hair, after an
   invocation to the threefold Subsistence of the Divine Beatitude, and
   when he has stripped off all his clothing, he covers him with
   different, and when, with all the holy men present, he has saluted him,
   he finishes by making him partaker of the supremely Divine Mysteries.

   III. Contemplation.

   Section I.

   The fact that he bends neither knee, nor has upon his head the
   Divinely-transmitted Oracles, but stands by the Priest, who pronounces
   the invocation, signifies, that the monastic Rank is not for leading
   others, but stands by itself, in a monastic and holy state, following
   the sacerdotal Ranks, and readily conducted by them, as a follower, to
   the Divine science of sacred things, according to its capacity.

   Section II.

   And the renunciation of the divided, not only lives, but even
   imaginations, shews the most perfect love of wisdom in the Monks, which
   exercises itself in science of the unifying commandments. For it is, as
   I said, not of the middle Rank of the initiated, but of the higher than
   all.

   Section III.

   Therefore many of the things, which are done without reproach by the
   middle Rank, are forbidden in every way to the single Monks,--inasmuch
   as they are under obligation to be unified to the One, and to be
   collected to a sacred Monad, and to be transformed to the sacerdotal
   life, as far as lawful, as possessing an affinity to it in many things,
   and as being nearer to it than the other Ranks of the initiated. Now
   the sealing with the sign of the Cross, as we have already said,
   denotes the inaction of almost all the desires of the flesh. And the
   cropping of the hair shews the pure and unpretentious life, which does
   not beautify the darkness within the mind, by overlarding it with
   smeared pretence, but that it by itself is being led, not by human
   attractions but by single and monastic, to the highest likeness of God.

   Section IV.

   The casting aside of the former clothing, and the taking a different,
   is intended to shew the transition from a middle religious life to the
   more perfect; just as, during the holy Birth from God, the exchange of
   the clothing denoted the elevation of a thoroughly purified life, to a
   contemplative and enlightened condition. And even if now also the
   Priest, and all the religious present, salute the man ordained,
   understand from this the holy fellowship of the Godlike, who lovingly
   congratulate each other in a Divine rejoicing.

   Section V.

   Last of all, the Priest calls the ordained to the supremely Divine
   Communion, shewing religiously that the ordained, if he would really
   attain to the monastic and single elevation, will not merely
   contemplate the sacred mysteries within them, nor come to the communion
   of the most holy symbols, after the fashion of the middle Rank, but,
   with a Divine knowledge of the holy things received by him, will come
   to the reception of the supremely Divine Communion, in a manner
   different from that of the holy people. Wherefore, the Communion of the
   most holy Eucharist is also given to the sacerdotal Orders, in their
   consecrating dedications, by the Hierarch who consecrated them, at the
   end of their most holy sanctifications, not only because the reception
   of the supremely Divine Mysteries is the consummation of each
   Hierarchical reception, but because all the sacred Orders, according to
   their capacity, partake of the self-same common and most godly gifts,
   for their own elevation and perfection in deification. We conclude,
   then, that the holy Mystic Rites are, purification, and illumination,
   and consecration. The Leitourgoi are a purifying rank, the Priests an
   illuminating, and the Godlike Hierarchs a consecrating. But the holy
   people is a contemplative Order. That which does not participate in the
   sacred contemplation and communion, is a Rank being purified, as still
   under course of purification. The holy people is a contemplative Rank,
   and that of the single Monks is a perfected Rank. For thus our
   Hierarchy, reverently arranged in Ranks fixed by God, is like the
   Heavenly Hierarchies, preserving, so far as man can do, its
   God-imitated and Godlike characteristics.

   Section VI.

   But thou wilt say that the Ranks undergoing purification utterly fall
   short of the Heavenly Hierarchies (for it is neither permitted nor true
   to say that any heavenly Ordering is defiled), yea, I would altogether
   affirm myself, that they are entirely without blemish, and possess a
   perfect purity above this world, unless I had completely fallen away
   from a religious mind. For if any of them should have become captive to
   evil, and have fallen from the heavenly and undefiled harmony of the
   divine Minds, he would be brought to the gloomy fall of the rebellious
   multitudes. But one may reverently say with regard to the Heavenly
   Hierarchy, that the illuminating from God in things hitherto unknown is
   a purification to the subordinate Beings, leading them to a more
   perfect science of the supremely Divine kinds of knowledge, and
   purifying them as far as possible from the ignorance of those things of
   which they had not hitherto the science, conducted, as they are, by the
   first and more Divine Beings to the higher and more luminous splendours
   of the visions of God: and so there are Ranks being illuminated and
   perfected, and purifying and illuminating and perfecting, after the
   example of the Heavenly Hierarchy; since the highest and more Divine
   Beings purify the subordinate, holy, and reverent Orders, from all
   ignorance (in ranks and proportions of the Heavenly Hierarchies), and
   filling them with the most Divine illuminatings, and perfecting in the
   most pure science of the supremely Divine conceptions. For we have
   already said, and the Oracles divinely demonstrate, that all the
   heavenly Orders are not the same, in all the sacred sciences of the
   God-contemplating visions; but the first, from G.od immediately, and,
   through these, again from God, the subordinate are illuminated, in
   proportion to their powers, with the most luminous glories of the
   supremely Divine ray.
     __________________________________________________________________

  CAPUT VII.

   I. Concerning things performed over those fallen asleep.

   Section I.

   These things having been defined, I think it necessary also to describe
   the things religiously performed by us over those who have fallen
   asleep. For neither is this also the same between the holy and the
   unholy; but, as the form of life of each is different, so also, when
   approaching death, those who have led a religious life, by looking
   steadfastly to the unfailing promises of the Godhead (inasmuch as they
   have observed their proof, in the resurrection proclaimed by it), come
   to the goal of death, with firm and unfailing hope, in godly rejoicing,
   knowing that at the end of holy contests their condition will be
   altogether in a perfect and endless life and safety, through their
   future entire resurrection [266] . For the holy souls, which may
   possibly fall during this present life to a change for the worse, in
   the regeneration, will have the most Godlike transition to an
   unchangeable condition. Now, the pure bodies which are enrolled
   together as yoke-fellows and companions of the holy souls, and have
   fought together within their Divine struggles in the unchanged
   steadfastness of their souls throughout the divine life, will jointly
   receive their own resurrection; for, having been united with the holy
   souls to which they were united in this present life, by having become
   members of Christ, they will receive in return the Godlike and
   imperishable immortality, and blessed repose. In this respect then the
   sleep of the holy is in comfort and unshaken hopes, as it attains the
   goal of the Divine contests.

   Section II.

   Now, amongst the profane, some [267] illogically think to go to a
   non-existence; others [268] that the bodily blending with their proper
   souls will be severed once for all, as unsuitable to them in a Divine
   life and blessed lots, not considering nor being sufficiently
   instructed in Divine science, that our most Godlike life in Christ has
   already begun [269] . But others [270] assign to souls union with other
   bodies, committing [271] , as I think, this injustice to them, that,
   after (bodies) have laboured together with the godly souls, and have
   reached the goal of their most Divine course, they relentlessly deprive
   them of their righteous retributions. And others [272] (I do not know
   how they have strayed to conceptions of such earthly tendency) say,
   that the most holy and blessed repose promised to the devout is similar
   to our life in this world, and unlawfully reject, for those who are
   equal to the Angels, nourishments appropriate to another kind of life.
   None of the most religious men, however, will ever fall into such
   errors as these; but, knowing that their whole selves will receive the
   Christ-like inheritance, when they have come to the goal of this
   present life, they see more clearly their road to incorruption already
   become nearer, and extol the gifts of the Godhead, and are filled with
   a Divine satisfaction, no longer fearing the fall to a worse condition,
   but knowing well that they will hold firmly and everlastingly the good
   things already acquired. Those, however, who are full of blemishes, and
   unholy stains, even though they have attained to some initiation, yet,
   of their own accord, have, to their own destruction, rejected this from
   their mind, and have rashly followed their destructive lusts, to them
   when they have come to the end of their life here, the Divine
   regulation of the Oracles will no longer appear as before, a subject of
   scorn [273] , but, when they have looked with different eyes upon the
   pleasures of their passions destroyed, and when they have pronounced
   blessed the holy life from which they thoughtlessly fell away, they
   are, piteously and against their will, separated from this present
   life, conducted to no holy hope, by reason of their shameful life [274]
   .

   Section III.

   Now, whilst none of these attain the repose of the holy men, he
   himself, when coming to the end of his own struggles, is filled with a
   holy consolation, and with much satisfaction enters the path of the
   holy regeneration. The familiar friends, however, of him who has fallen
   asleep, as befits their divine familiarity and fellowship, pronounce
   him blessed, whoever he is, as having reached the desired end crowned
   with victory, and they send up odes of thanksgiving to the Author of
   victory, praying also that they may reach the same inheritance. Then
   they take him and bring him to the Hierarch, as to a bequest of holy
   crowns; and he right gladly receives him, and performs the things fixed
   by reverend men, to be performed over those who have piously fallen
   asleep.

   II. Mysterion over those who have religiously fallen asleep.

   The Divine Hierarch collects the reverend Choir, and if the person who
   has fallen asleep were of the sacerdotal rank, he lays him down before
   the Divine Altar, and begins with the prayer and thanksgiving to God;
   but if he belonged to the rank of the chaste Monks, or the holy people,
   he lays him down near the hallowed sanctuary, before the sacerdotal
   entrance. Then the Hierarch finishes the prayer of thanksgiving to God;
   and next, the Leitourgoi, after reading the unfailing promises
   concerning our holy resurrection, contained in the Divine Oracles,
   reverently chant the odes of the same teaching and power, from the
   Oracles of the Psalter [275] . Then the first Leitourgos dismisses the
   catechumens, and calls aloud the names of the holy people, who have
   already fallen asleep; amongst whom he deems the man, who has just
   terminated his life, worthy of mention in the same rank, and urges all
   to seek the blessed consummation in Christ; then the Divine Hierarch
   advances, and offers a most holy prayer over him, and after the prayer
   both the Hierarch himself salutes the defunct, and after him, all who
   are present. When all have saluted, the Hierarch pours the oil upon the
   fallen asleep, and when he has offered the holy prayer for all, he
   places the body in a worthy chamber, with other holy bodies of the same
   rank.

   III. Contemplation.

   Section I.

   Now, if the profane should see or hear that these things are done by
   us, they will, I suppose, split with laughter, and commiserate us on
   our, folly. But there is no need to wonder at this. For, as the Oracles
   say, "If they will not believe, neither shall they understand [276] ."
   And as for us, who have contemplated the spiritual meaning of the
   things done, whilst Jesus leads us to the light, let us say, that, not
   without reason, does the Hierarch conduct to, and place the man fallen
   asleep, in the place of the same rank; for it shews reverently, that,
   in the regeneration, all will be in those chosen inheritances, for
   which they have chosen their own life here [277] . For example, if any
   one led a Godlike and most holy life here, so far as the imitation of
   God is attainable by man, he will be, in the age to come, in divine and
   blessed inheritances; but if he led a life inferior to the divine
   likeness in the highest degree, but, nevertheless, a holy life, even
   this man will receive the holy and similar retributions. The Hierarch,
   having given thanks for this Divine righteousness, offers a sacred
   prayer, and extols the worshipful Godhead, as subjugating the unjust
   and tyrannical power against us all, and conducting us back to our own
   most just possessions (or judgments).

   Section II.

   Now, the Chants and Readings of the supremely Divine promises are
   explanatory of the most blessed inheritances, to which those, who have
   attained a Divine perfection, shall be eternally appointed, and
   descriptive of him who has religiously fallen asleep, and stimulative
   of those, who are still living, to the same perfection.

   Section III.

   Observe, however, that not all the ranks under purification are
   customarily dismissed, but only the catechumens are expelled from the
   holy places, for this class is entirely uninitiated in every holy Rite,
   and is not permitted to view any of the religious celebrations, great
   or small, inasmuch as it has not participated in the faculty of
   contemplating the holy mysteries, through the Birth from God, which is
   Source and gift of light. The rest, however, of the ranks under
   purification, have already been under instruction in sacred tradition;
   but, as they have foolishly returned to an evil course it is incumbent
   to complete their proper elevation in advance, and they are reasonably
   dismissed from the supremely Divine contemplations and communions, as
   in holy symbols; for they will be injured, by partaking of them
   unholily, and will come to a greater contempt of the Divine Mysteries
   and themselves.

   Section IV.

   Naturally, however, they are present at the things now done, being
   clearly taught by seeing both the fearlessness of death amongst us, and
   the last honour of the saints extolled from the unfailing Oracles, and
   that the sufferings threatened to the unholy like themselves will be
   endless; for it will perhaps be profitable for them to have seen him,
   who has religiously finished his course, reverently proclaimed by the
   public proclamation of the Leitourgoi, as being certainly companion of
   the Saints for ever. And, perchance, even they will come to the like
   aspiration, and will be taught from the science of the Liturgy, that
   the consummation in Christ is blessed indeed.

   Section V.

   Then the Divine Hierarch, advancing, offers a holy prayer over the man
   fallen asleep. After the prayer, both the Hierarch himself salutes him,
   and next all who are present. Now the prayer beseeches the supremely
   Divine Goodness to remit to the man fallen asleep all the failings
   committed by reason of human infirmity, and to transfer him in light
   and land of living, into the bosom of Abraham, and Isaac, and Jacob: in
   a place where grief and sorrow and sighing are no more. It is evident,
   then, as I think, that these, the rewards of the pious, are most
   blessed. For what can be equal to an immortality entirely without grief
   and luminous with light. Especially if all the promises which pass
   man's understanding, and which are signified to us by signs adapted to
   our capacity, fall short, in their description, of their actual truth.
   For we must remember that the Logion is true, that "Eye hath not seen,
   nor ear heard, neither hath entered into the heart of man to conceive,
   the things which God hath prepared for them that love Him." "Bosoms" of
   the blessed Patriarchs, and of all the other pious men, are, in my
   judgment, the most divine and blessed inheritances, which await all
   godly men, in that consummation which grows not old, and is full of
   blessedness.

   Section VI.

   But thou mayst, perhaps, say that these things are correctly affirmed
   by us, indeed, but want to know for what reason the Hierarch beseeches
   the supremely Divine Goodness, for the remission of the faults
   committed by the man fallen asleep, and his most glorious inheritance,
   amongst godly men of the same rank. For, if every one shall receive, by
   the Divine justice, equivalents for what he has done in the present
   life, whether it be good or different, and the man fallen asleep has
   finished his own activities in this present life, from what prayer
   offered by the Hierarch will he be transferred to another inheritance,
   than that due to and equivalent for his life here? Now, well do I know,
   following the Oracles, that each one will have the inheritance
   equivalent; for the Lord says, he has closed respecting him, and each
   one shall receive the things done in his body according to that he hath
   done, whether it be good, or whether it be bad." Yea, the sure
   traditions of the Oracles teach us that the prayers, even of the just,
   avail only for those who are worthy of pious prayers during this
   present life, let alone (by no means) after death. What forsooth did
   Saul gain from Samuel? and what did the intercession of the Prophet
   profit the people of the Hebrews? For, as if any one, when the sun is
   shedding its own splendour upon unblemished eyes, seeks to enjoy the
   solar splendour by obliterating his own powers of vision; so does he
   cling to impossible and extravagant expectations, who beseeches the
   intercessions of holy men, and, by driving away the holy efforts
   natural to the same, plays truant from the most luminous and beneficent
   commandments, through heedlessness of the Divine gifts.

   Nevertheless, according to the Oracles, I affirm that the intercessions
   of the pious are, in every respect, profitable in this present life,
   after the following fashion. If any one, longing for holy gifts, and
   having a religious disposition for their reception, as recognizing his
   own insufficiency, approaches some pious man, and should prevail upon
   him to become his fellow-helper, and fellow-suppliant, he will be
   benefitted in every respect, thereby, with a benefit superior to all;
   for he will attain the most Divine gifts he prays for, since the
   supremely Divine Goodness assists him, as well as his pious judgment of
   himself, and his reverence for devout men, and his praiseworthy craving
   for the religious requests requested, and his brotherly and Godlike
   disposition. For this has been firmly fixed by the supremely Divine
   decrees, that the Divine gifts are given, in an order most befitting
   God, to those who are meet to receive them, through those who are meet
   to distribute them.

   If any one, then, should despise this sacred regulation, and betaking
   himself to a wretched self-conceit, should deem himself sufficient for
   the supremely Divine Converse, and look down upon pious men, and if he
   should further request requests, unworthy of God, and not holy, and if
   he should have his aspiration for things divine not sustained, and
   correlative to himself, he will fail in his ignorant request, through
   his own fault. Now, with reference to the prayer mentioned, which the
   Hierarch prays over the man fallen asleep, we think it necessary to
   mention the tradition which has come to us from our inspired leaders.
   The Divine Hierarch, as the Oracles say, is interpreter of the
   supremely Divine awards; for he is messenger of the Lord God
   Omnipotent. He has learned then, from the God-transmitted Oracles, that
   to those who have passed their life piously, the most bright and divine
   life is given in return, according to their due, by the most just
   balances, the Divine Love towards man overlooking, through its
   goodness, the stains which have come to them through human infirmity,
   since no one, as the Oracles say, is pure from blemish.

   Section VII.

   Now, the Hierarch knew these things to have been promised by the
   infallible Oracles; and he asks, that these things may come to pass,
   and that the righteous returns be given to those who have lived
   piously, whilst being moulded beneficently to the Divine imitation, he
   beseeches gifts for others, as favours to himself; and, whilst knowing
   that the promises will be unfailing, he makes known clearly to those
   present, that the things asked by him, according to a holy law, will be
   entirely realized for those who have been perfected in a Divine life.
   For the Hierarch, the expounder of the supremely Divine Justice, would
   never seek things, which were not most pleasing to the Almighty God,
   and divinely promised to be given by Him [278] . Wherefore, he does not
   offer these prayers over the unholy fallen asleep, not only because in
   this he would deviate from his office of expounder, and would
   presumptuously arrogate, on his own authority, a function of the
   Hierarchy, without being moved by the Supreme Legislator, but because
   he would both fail to obtain his abominable prayer, and he, not
   unnaturally, would hear from the just Oracle, "Ye ask, and receive not,
   because ye ask amiss." Therefore, the Divine Hierarch beseeches things
   divinely promised, and dear to God, and which will, in every respect,
   be given, demonstrating both his own likeness to the good loving God,
   and declaring explicitly the gifts which will be received by the
   devout. Thus, the Hierarchs have discriminating powers, as interpreters
   of the Divine Awards, not as though the All-Wise Deity, to put it
   mildly, were slavishly following their irrational impulses, but, as
   though they, as expounders of God, were separating, by the motion of
   the Divine Spirit, those who have already been judged by God, according
   to due. For "receive," he says, "the Holy Spirit, whose faults ye may
   have remitted, they are remitted; whose ye may have retained, they are
   retained." And to him who was illuminated with the Divine revelations
   of the most Holy Father, the Oracles say, "Whatsoever thou shalt have
   bound upon the earth, shall be bound in the heavens; and whatsoever
   thou shalt have loosed on earth, shall be loosed in the heavens,"
   inasmuch as he, and every Hierarch like him, according to the
   revelations of the Father's awards through him, receives those dear to
   God, and rejects those without God, as announcing and interpreting the
   Divine Will. Further, as the Oracles affirm, he uttered that sacred and
   divine confession, not as self-moved, nor as though flesh and blood had
   revealed it, but moved by God Who revealed to him the spiritual meaning
   of Divine things. The inspired Hierarchs then must so exercise their
   separations and all their Hierarchical powers as the Godhead, the
   Supreme Initiator, may move them; and the others must so cling to the
   Hierarchs as moved by God, in what they may do hierarchically, "For he
   who despiseth you," He says, "despiseth Me [279] ."

   Section VIII.

   Let us now proceed to that, which follows the prayer mentioned. When
   the Hierarch has finished it, he first salutes the fallen asleep, and
   next, all who are present; for dear and honoured by all Godlike men is
   he who has been perfected in a Divine life. After the salutation, the
   Hierarch pours the oil upon the man fallen asleep. And remember, that
   during the sacred Birth from God, before the most Divine Baptism, a
   first participation of a holy symbol is given to the man initiated--the
   oil of Chrism--after the entire removal of the former clothing; and
   now, at the conclusion of all, the Oil is poured upon the man fallen
   asleep. Then indeed the anointing with the Oil summoned the initiated
   to the holy contests; and now the Oil poured upon him shews the fallen
   asleep to have struggled, and to have been made perfect, throughout
   those same contests.

   Section IX.

   When the Hierarch has finished these things, he places the body in an
   honourable chamber, with other holy bodies of the same rank. For if, in
   soul and body, the man fallen asleep passed a life dear to God, there
   will be honoured, with the devout soul, the body also, which contended
   with it throughout the devout struggles. Hence the Divine justice gives
   to it, together with its own body, the retributive inheritances, as
   companion and participator in the devout, or the contrary, life.
   Wherefore, the Divine institution of sacred rites bequeaths the
   supremely Divine participations to them both--to the soul, indeed, in
   pure contemplation and in science of the things being done, and to the
   body, by sanctifying the whole man, as in a figure with the most Divine
   Muron, and the most holy symbols of the supremely Divine Communion,
   sanctifying the whole man, and announcing, by purifications of the
   whole man, that his resurrection will be most complete.

   Section X.

   Now, as regards the consecrating" invocations, it is not permitted to
   explain them in writing, nor may we bring their mysterious meaning, or
   the powers from God working in them, from secrecy to publicity; but, as
   our sacred tradition holds, by learning these, through quiet
   instructions, and being perfected to a more Godlike condition and
   elevation, through Divine love and religious exercises, thou wilt be
   borne by the consecrating enlightenment to their highest science.

   Section XI.

   Now the fact that even children, not yet able to understand the things
   Divine, become recipients of the holy Birth in God, and of the most
   holy symbols of the supremely Divine Communion, seems, as you say, to
   the profane, a fit subject for reasonable laughter, if the Hierarchs
   teach things Divine to those not able to hear, and vainly transmit the
   sacred traditions to those who do not understand. And this is still
   more laughable--that others, on their behalf, repeat the abjurations
   and the sacred compacts. But thy Hierarchical judgment must not be too
   hard upon those who are led astray, but, persuasively, and for the
   purpose of leading them to the light, reply affectionately to the
   objections alleged by them, bringing forward this fact, in accordance
   with sacred rule, that not all things Divine are comprehended in our
   knowledge, but many of the things, unknown by us, have causes beseeming
   God, unknown to us indeed, but well known to the Ranks above us. Many
   things also escape even the most exalted Beings, and are known
   distinctly by the All-Wise and Wise-making Godhead alone. Further,
   also, concerning this, we affirm the same things which our Godlike
   initiators conveyed to us, after initiations from the early [280]
   tradition. For they say, what is also a fact, that infants, being
   brought up according to a Divine institution, will attain a religious
   disposition, exempt from every error, and inexperienced in an
   unholy-life. When our Divine leaders came to this conclusion, it was
   determined to admit infants upon the following conditions, viz.: that
   the natural parents of the child presented, should transfer the child
   to some one of the initiated,--a good teacher of children in Divine
   things,--and that the child should lead the rest of his life under him,
   as under a godfather and sponsor, for his religious safe-keeping. The
   Hierarch then requires him, when he has promised to bring up the child
   according to the religious life, to pronounce the renunciations and the
   religious professions, not, as they would jokingly say, by instructing
   one instead of another in Divine things; for he does not say this,
   "that on behalf of this child I make, myself, the renunciations and the
   sacred professions," but, that the child is set apart and enlisted;
   i.e. I promise to persuade the child, when he has come to a religious
   mind, through my godly instructions, to bid adieu wholly to things
   contrary, and to profess and perform the Divine professions. There is
   here, then, nothing absurd, in my judgment, provided the child is
   brought up as beseems a godlike training, in having a guide and
   religious surety, who implants in him a disposition for Divine things,
   and keeps him inexperienced in things contrary.

   The Hierarch imparts to the child the sacred, symbols, in order that he
   may be nourished by them, and may not have any other life but that
   which always contemplates Divine things; and in religious progress
   become partaker of them and have a religious disposition in these
   matters, and be devoutly brought up by his Godlike surety. So great, my
   son, and so beautiful, are the uniform visions of our Hierarchy, which
   have been presented to my view; and from others, perhaps, more
   contemplative minds, these things have been viewed, not only more
   clearly, but also more divinely. And to thee, as I fancy, more
   brilliant and more divine beauties will shine forth, by using the
   foregoing stepping-stones to a higher ray. Impart then, my friend,
   thyself also, to me, more perfect enlightenment, and shew to mine eyes
   the more comely and uniform beauties that thou mayst have been able to
   see, for I am confident that, by what has been said, I shall strike the
   sparks [281] of the Divine Fire stored up in thee.

   Thanks be to God.
