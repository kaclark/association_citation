> SECTION VI.

The theologians, having knowledge of this, celebrate It, both without Name and from every Name.
Without name, as when they say that the Godhead Itself, in one of those mystical apparitions of the symbolical Divine manifestation, rebuked him who said, "What is thy name?" and as leading him away from all knowledge of the Divine Name, said this, "and   why dost thou ask my Name? "and this (Name) "is wonderful," And is not this in reality the wonderful Name, that which is above every Name--the Nameless--that fixed above every name which is named, whether in this age or in that which is to come? Also, as "many named," as when they   again introduce It as saying, "I am He, Who is--the Life--the Light--the God--the Truth.
"And when the wise of God themselves celebrate Him, as Author of all things, under many Names, from all created things--as Good--as Beautiful--as Wise--as Beloved--as God of gods--as Lord of lords--as Holy of Holies--as Eternal--as Being--as Author of Ages--as Provider of Life--as Wisdom--as Mind--as Word--as Knowing--as preeminently possessing all the treasures of all knowledge--as Power--as Powerful--as King of kings--as Ancient of days--as never growing old--and Unchangeable--as Preservation--as Righteousness--as Sanctification -- as Redemption--as surpassing all   things in greatness--and as in a gentle breeze.
--Yea, they also say   that He is in minds, and in souls, and in bodies, and in heaven and in   earth, and at once, the same in the same--in the world--around the   world--above the world--supercelestial, superessential, sun,   star--fire--water--spirit--dew--cloud--self-hewn stone and rock--all   things existing--and not one of things existing.
