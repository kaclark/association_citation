Innate Immune Mechanisms include anti-microbial peptides that lyse the cell open by breaking down membreanes. Lysozymes can also tear away at the protective coating bacteria have. Skin and Mucus are massive parts of the immune system. 

What is Complement?

In the Serum of blood sheep that have been immunized there should be Lysozymes.

> Immunize:Sheep[&lambda;.specimen] &rarr; Lysed Serum

> Null:Sheep[&lambda;.specimen] &rarr; Intact Bacteria

The application of heat to the immunized Serum shows bacterial growth 

> Heat:Serum &rarr; Bacterial Presence

> Immunize&#9702;Heat:Sheep &rarr; Intact Bacteria

> Immunize&#9702;Heat&#9702;Mix Serum:Sheep &rarr; Lysed Serum

This demonstrates that there are two parameters: a heat resistent one and a heat labile factor. That which persists the heat treatment are antibodies. That which does not are compliments.

Of ~50 proteins &sub; Compliment

10-15% of serum is protein compliment

The Compliment Cascade works in Series
1. Link antigen targetting to function
2. Signal Amplification (small &delta; &rarr; large &Delta;)
3. Link adaptive and Innate Immunity

Blood clotting and compliment cascade are similar.
3 Activation Pathways: Classical, Lectin, Alternative
