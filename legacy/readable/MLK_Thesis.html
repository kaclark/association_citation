Newhall. I Working with Newhall and DeWolf, King developed a bibliography, a  preliminary organizational outline, and a short introduction.2 During the summer  of I953 King contacted Wieman and Tillich to ask if thqi knew of any similar  comparisons of their thought.Y Beyond these exploratory letters, though, the newly  married King did not work on the dissertation while serving as pastor in charge of  Ebenezer during the summer. After studying during the fall and winter, King  passed his final comprehensive examination in February 1954 and began working  extensively on the dissertation.4 On 9 April, just a few days after he accepted the  call to Dexter, King’s outline was approved by the Graduate School.  In the first chapter, after explaining his choice of the topic, King reviewed his  sources. In the second chapter he explored the methodologies of the two theologians.  By using a “method of correlation” Tillich soughtfirst to describe the questions  generated by the human condition and then to examine the specifically Christian  symbols used to answer those questions. Wieman appealed to the scientific method,  using “sensory observation, experimental behavior, and rational inference”  to analyze Christian beliefs. In chapters 3 and 4 King described Tillich’s and  Wieman’s conceptions of God. In the fifth chapter he compared and criticized their  ideas.5  King’s initial drafts of the dissertation were marked by the flawed citation  practices that characterized his other academic essays and the final version of the  dissertation. King appropriated virtually all of his first draft of the introduction  I. Jannette E. Newhall (1898-1979) studied at Radcliffe and Columbia and received her  Ph.D. from Boston University in 193 I. After teaching at Wheaton College in Norton, Massachu-  setts, she worked at Andover-Harvard Theological Library and other libraries in Massachusetts.  Newhall was librarian and professor of research methods, as well as Brightman’s longtime assis-  tant, at Boston University’s School of Theology from 1949 until her retirement in 1962. Her  course on research methods covered, among other things, correct citation practices and ethical  use of sources.

King’s faulty citation practices were rooted in the notecards he created while  conducting research on Tillich and Wieman.8 Large sections of the expository  chapters are verbatim transcriptions of these notecards, in which errors he had  made while creating his notes are perpetuated. In one case, although King properly  quoted Tillich on the notecard, he used a section of the quotation in the dissertation  without quotation marks.9 Some of the notecards were adequately paraphrased from  Tillich and Wieman, but many others were nearly identical to the source. King  rarely noted down proper citations as he took notes, particularly from secondary  sources. After reading an author’s interpretation of a Tillich quotation, for  example, King would transcribe the interpretation, the Tillich quotation, and the  footnote to Tillich’s writings but would neglect to mention the secondary source.  One of his most important uncredited sources was a Boston University dissertation  on Tillich that DeWolfhad readjust three years before. In the introduction King  noted his reliance on “valuable secondary sources” and acknowledged Jack  Boozer’s “very fine” dissertation; thereafter, however, King obscured the extent to  which he utilized this secondary source by citing it only twice.1° He also relied  heavily on a review of Tillich’s Systematic Theology by Raphael Demos,  King’s professor at Haruard, and on several essays in a collection entitled The  Theology of Paul Tillich, underreporting these sources in his citations.

It is unclear when King created these notecards. He probably wrote the bulk of them in  Boston the summer of 1954 before moving to Montgomery, since many of his materials, particu-  larly articles in scholarly journals, would not be available in Montgomery. He did, however, con-  tinue to check out library books from Boston University’s library while in Montgomery. See Flor-  ence Mitchell to King, 15 October 1954, MLKP-MBU: Box 117. Tzllzch, ed.

DeWolf and Schilling had mostly praise for King5 draft, pointing out only  minor changes necessary for their approval. In characteristically brief fashion,  DeWolfreturned King’s draft with very few comections or marginal comments,  praising King for succeeding “with broad learning, impressive ability and  convincing mastery of the works immediately involved. ’’ Schilling, evaluating one  of his first dissertations as a professor, provided more extensive comments than  DeWolf. In two instances Schilling noticed that King had improperly cited his  sources by “inaccurately” quoting a Tillich text and omitting quotation marks  around another paragraph. Acknowledging that the first draft was “competently  done, . . . carefully organized and systematically developed,” Schilling promised to  approve the dissertation after the appropriate changes were made.I3 King  incorporated many of these corrections, but made few other changes as he revised  the dissertation.  After submitting the final draft sometime before the 15 April deadline, King  returned to Boston to defend his work before an examining committee. Chaired by  Schilling, the committee included DeWolf, Peter A. Bertocci, John H. Lavely,  Richard M. Millard, and Newhall.I4 On 31 May the graduate school faculty of  Boston University oficially voted to confer the doctorate on King at the university’s  commencement on 5 June. Unable to be present for the service, King received the  Ph.D. in systematic theology in absentia.  Table of Contents  I. INTRODUCTION  1. Statement of problem  2. Sources of data  3.

Statement of problem  The problem of this dissertation is to compare and evaluate the conceptions  of God in the thinking of Paul Tillich and Henry Nelson Wieman.  It was in the year of 1935, at a ten-day seminar on religion, that Paul Tillich  and Henry Nelson Wieman, along with several other distinguished religious  thinkers, gathered at Fletcher Farm, Proctorsville, Vermont, to discuss some  of the vital problems of religion. One of the most heated discussions of the  conference was a discussion on the nature of God, in which all lecturers took  part.’ In this particular discussion, Tillich and Wieman ended up in radically  different positions. Wieman contended that Tillich “was at the same time  more monistic and less realistic than he . . . pluralistic at the human level and  monistic at the transcendent level.” Against this monistic thinking, Wieman  sought to maintain an “ultimate pluralism whereby God was in no way re-  sponsible for evil . . . with no statement as to the ultimate outcome of the  struggle between it and good and as opposed to God, not merely an instru-  ment of God for good.”” Tillich in reply “commented upon Dr. Wieman’s  complete break with the Christian tradition and Greek philosophy, and char-  acterized his position as in direct line with Zoroastrianism . . . the plurality of  powers and the duality of good and evil. . . . God was a duality and at the  same time ultimate, which was a contradiction in terms.”?  It is probable that Wieman and Tillich went away from this conference not  fully understanding each other’s position. The controversy between Wieman  and Tillich arose again a few years later when Wieman, in The Growth of  Religion, grouped Tillich, Barth, Brunner, and Niebuhr together as “neo-  supernaturalists.” In a review of this book, Tillich sought to make it palpably  clear that Wieman was erroneous in his grouping. Tillich writes:  What we have in common is simply the attempt to affirm to explain the majesty  of God in the sense of the prophets, apostles and reformers-a reality which we  feel is challenged by naturalistic as well as the fundamentalistic theology.+ *  * Quoted from Horton, Art.

And so Tillich goes on to affirm:  With respect to myself, I only need point to practically all my writings and their  fight against the “side by side” theology even if it appears in the disguise of a  “super.” The Unconditioned is a qualification of the conditioned, of the world  and the natural, by which the conditioned is affirmed and denied at the same  time.*$  In other words, Tillich is seeking to make it clear that he cannot be labeled a  supernaturalist. The Divine, as he sees it, is not a being that dwells in some  transcendent realm; it is the “power of being” found in the “ecstatic” charac-  ter of &I&  It is clear that in neither of these debates has the real difference between  Wieman and Tillich been defined. Yet there is a real difference which needs  to be defined. This dissertation grows out of an attempt to meet just this need.  The concept of God has been chosen because of the central place which it  occupies in any religion; and because of the ever present need to interpret  and clarify the God-concept. And these men have been chosen because they  are fountainhead personalities; and because each of them, in the last few  years has had an increasing influence upon the climate of theological and  philosophical thought.  2. Sources of data  The primary sources of data are those works of Tillich and Wieman in  which the concept of God is treated. Prominent among Tillich’s writings  which contain discussions of the conception of God are the following in  chronological order: The Religious Situation (1932), The Interpretation of  * Tillich, Rev. (1940). 70.  ‘neo-supernaturalists.’ In his review of this book, Tillich rejected Wieman’s interpretation of all  four, while also objecting to the grouping. ‘What we all have in common,’ he says, ‘is simply the  attempt to affirm and to explain the majesty of God in the sense of the prophets, apostles and  reformers-a reality which we feel is challenged by the naturalistic as well as the fundamentalistic  theology.’ ”  3. Horton, “Tillich’s Role in Contemporary Theology,” p. 37: “This affirmation does not put  God ‘outside’ the natural world, as Wieman claims, even in the case of Barth. . . . ‘With respect to  myself, I only need point to practically all my writings and their fight against the “side by side”  theology even if it appears in the disguise of a “super.” The Unconditioned is a qualification of  the conditioned, of the world and the natural, by which the conditioned is affirmed and denied  at the same time.”’  4. Horton, “Tillich’s Role in Contemporary Theology,” p. 37: “The Divine, as he sees it, does  not inhabit a transcendent world above nature; it is found in the ‘estatic’ character of this world, as  its transcendent Depth and Ground.” 346 </p><div id="pagenum"><p>The Martin Luther King, Jr. Papers Project </p></div><div id="pagenum"><p>History (1936), The Protestant Era (1948), Systematic Theology -.

These  articles may be found listed in the Bibliography.* 15 Apr  1955 The Courage to Be (1952).  3. Review of the work of other  investigators  Since the publication of his magnum opus, Systematic Theology, in 1951,  there has been an upsurge in the number of investigators of Paul Tillich’s  thought. Prior to that time James Luther Adams of the Federated Faculty of  the University of Chicago had been the chief interpreter of Tillich to Ameri-  can readers. Adams selected and translated the essays contained in The Prot-  estant Era which was published in 1948. As a final chapter in this book Adams  wrote an excellent interpretation of Tillich’s thought entitled “Tillich’s Con-  cept of the Protestant Era.” Adams had earlier translated a chapter of Tillichs  Religiose Verwirklichung and published it in the Journal of Liberal Religion.?  W. M. Urban was asked to give a critique of this article which appeared in the  same issue of the journal under the title, “A Critique of Professor Tillich’s  Theory of the Religious Symbol.”$  In 1952 a very fine dissertation was done in this school by Jack Boozer  entitled, The Place of Reason in Tillich’s Conception of God.

Numerous articles have appeared in theo-  logical and philosophical journals dealing with some phase of his thought.  The most obvious evidence for the growing interest in Tillich’s thought is the  fact that the editors of The Library of Living Theology chose him as the sub-  ject for the first volume.* This volume contains fourteen essays on various  aspects of Tillich’s thought by men like W. H. Horton, T. M. Greene, George  F. Thomas, John Herman Randall, Jr., Charles Hartshorne, Reinhold Nie-  buhr and J, L. Adams. At the end of the volume Tillich himself gives a reply  to the interpretations and criticisms of his thought. If the enthusiasm of the  contributors to this volume is an index of what is to come, we may expect even  more extensive investigations of Tillich’s thought in the future.  Wieman’s thought has also been investigated quite extensively. Ever since  he published his first book in 1927, Wieman’s thought has been interpreted  and criticised by thinkers of all shades of opinion. Throughout the nineteen  thirties and early forties theological and philosophical journals abounded with  interpretations of Wieman’s thought, and with the publication of his magnum  opus, The Source of Human Good, in 1946, such interpretations and criti-  cisms continued with tremendous strides. It is probably no exaggeration to  say that hardly a volume has appeared in the last twenty years in the fields of  philosophy of religion and systematic theology, which has not made some ref-  erence to Wieman’s thought, particularly to his conception of God.  The present inquiry will utilize from these valuable secondary sources any  results which bear directly on the problem, and will indicate such use by ap-  propriate footnotes.  4. Methods of investigation  Several methods of procedure will be employed in the investigation of the  problem stated for this dissertation. They are as follows:  * Kegley and Bretal  (ed.), TPT. This series is  consciously imitative of  Paul A. Schilpp’s, The Li-  brary of Living Philoso-  phers. The editors admit  that they are seeking to do  for present-day theology  what Schilpp has done and is continuing to do so  well for philosophy. Each  volume of The Library of  Living Theology, like The  Living Philosophers, will  be devoted to the thinking  of a single living theolo-  gian, and will include  (1) an intellectual autobi- ography; (2) essays on dif-  ferent aspects of the man’s  work, written by leading  scholars; (3) a “reply to his  critic” by the theologian  himself; and a complete  bibliography of his writ-  ings to date.6  6. “Introduction” to Kegley and Bretall, eds., Theology of Paul Tillich, pp. vii-viii: “[Schilpp’s]  idea was original and unique: to devote each volume in the series to the thinking of a single living  philosopher, and to include in each (1) an intellectual autobiography; (2) essays on different  aspects of the man’s work, written by leading scholars; (3) a ‘reply to his critics’ by the philosopher  himself; and (4) a complete bibliography of his writings to date. . . . Our aim, quite simply, is to  do for present-day theology what he has done and is continuing to do so well for philosophy.” 348 </p><div id="pagenum"><p>The Martin Luther King, Jr. Papers Project </p></div><div id="pagenum"><p>(1) Expository. ‘5 *P* </p></div><p id="page">We shall begin by looking at the thought of each man separately.

(3) Critical.  A critical evaluation of their conceptions of God will be given. In seeking to  give this critical evaluation two norms will be employed: (i) adequacy in ex-  pressing the religious values of historic Christianity; and (ii) adequacy in  meeting the philosophical requirements of consistency and coherence. We  shall also seek to discover the extent to which Tillich and Wieman claim to  measure up to the standards by which they are here criticized, thus making  the criticism internal as well as external. As a rule, critical appraisal will be  preserved until a thorough elaboration of Tillich’s and Wieman’s positions has  been made.’  Perhaps it is appropriate at this point to say a word concerning the general  philosophical and theological orientation of Wieman and Tillich. For Wie-  man, God, or “creativity,” or “the creative event,” is the producer, or the pro-  duction of unexpected, unpredictable good. In specifying the nature of the  creative event Wieman is both eloquent and illuminating.  Throughout Wieman’s thought it is very easy to see the influence of White-  head and Dewey. His naturalism and empiricism are quite reminiscent of  Dewey. Like Dewey, he speaks of processes of creation, and also describes the  production of good as issuing from a context of events. On the other hand,  he goes beyond Dewey by insisting that the emergence of value is the work of  God. Wieman sees a great deal of value in Whitehead’s “principle of concre-  tion,’’ but he is generally skeptical of his metaphysical speculations. Disagree-  ing both with Whiteheadian metaphysics and Dewey’s humanistic naturalism,  Wieman’s thought lies between these systems, containing a few features of  both, and some few emphases foreign to both.

The later, post-  Bohme philosophy of Schelling, the various mid-century reactions against the  panlogism of Hegel, like Feuerbach and the early Marx, Nietzsche and the  “philosophy of life,” and the more recent existentialism, especially of Hei-  degger-all these have contributed to Tillich’s formulation of philosophic  problems.8  7.

The structure of the dissertation  The Introduction presents the main problem of this study and presents a  brief summary of what other investigators have contributed to it. The mate-  rials on which this study is based and the methods which it follows are also set  forth.  Since the question of method is of such vital importance in theological and  philosophical construction, it will be necessary to discuss the methodologies  of Tillich and Wieman. This will be done in Chapter 11. In Chapter 111 an  exposition of Tillich’s conception of God is presented. In this Chapter it will  be necessary to devote a few pages to a discussion of Tillich’s ontology as a  whole, since it is his ultimate conviction that God is “being-itself.” In Chap-  ter IV an exposition of Wieman’s conception of God is given. In Chapter V  the conceptions of God in the thinking of Wieman and Tillich will be com-  pared and evaluated. Chapter VI will give the conclusions of the dissertation.  ism of Hegel, like Feuerbach and the early Marx, Nietzsche and the ‘philosophy of life,’ and the  more recent existentialism, especially of Heidegger-all these have contributed to his formula-  tion of philosophic issues and problems.” </p><div id="pagenum"><p>The Martin Luther King, Jr. Papers Project </p></div><div id="pagenum"><p>Chapter I1 </p></div><p id="page">THE METHODOLOGIES OF  TILLICH AND WIEMAN  The question of theological method has been much discussed during the  past century. Many hold that only as one settles this question can one expect  to settle any other, for it underlies every other. Tillich and Wieman agree that  the question of method is of fundamental importance, and both take pains to  elaborate their methodologies.  Since the question of method is of such vital importance in theological con-  struction, it is hardly possible to gain an adequate understanding of a theolo-  gian’s basic thought without an understanding of his methodology. So we can  best begin our study of the conceptions of God held by Tillich and Wieman  by giving an exposition of their methodologies. We turn first to Tillich.  1. Tillich’s method of correlation  Throughout his theology Tillich undertakes the difficult task of setting  forth a systematic theology which is at the same time an apologetic. His aim is  to show that the Christian message actually does answer the questions which  modern man is being forced to ask about his existence, his salvation and his  destiny.  Tillich’s theology is quite frankly a dialogue between classical Christianity  and modern man. In this it is analogous to the work of the second century  apologists who mediated between Christianity and late classical culture.  The method used to effect this apologetic task is the “method of correla-  tion.” In Tillich’s first book entitled, Das System der Wissenschaften nach Ge-  genstanden und Methoden (“The System of Knowledge: Its Contents and Its  Methods”), theology is defined as “theonomous metaphysics.” This definition  was Tillich’s first step toward what he now calls the method of correlation. In  the method of correlation Tillich seeks to overcome the conflict between the  naturalistic and supernaturalistic methods, a conflict which he thinks imperils  real progress in the work of systematic theology and also imperils any possible  effect of theology on the secular world. The method of correlation shows the  interdependence between the ultimate questions to which philosophy is driven  and the answers given in the Christian message.’  Philosophy cannot answer ultimate or existential questions philosophy. If  the philosopher tries to answer them . . . he becomes a theologian. And, con-  1. Paul Tillich, The Protestant Era, trans. James Luther Adams (Chicago: University of Chi-  cago Press, 1948), p. xxvi: “The method of correlation shows, at every point of Christian thought,  the interdependence between the ultimate questions to which philosophy (as well as pre-  philosophical thinking) is driven and the answers given in the Christian message.” 351 </p><div id="pagenum"><p>The Martin Luther King, Jr. Papers Project </p></div><div id="pagenum"><p>‘5 *Pr versely, theology cannot answer these questions without accepting their presup- </p></div><p id="page">‘955 positions and implications.*  In this method question and answer determine each other; if they are sepa-  rated, the traditional answers become unintelligible, and the actual questions  remain unanswered. Philosophy and theology are not separated, and they are  not identical, but they are correlated.‘ Such a method seeks to be dialectical  in the true sense of the word. In order to gain a clearer understanding of this  method of correlation it is necessary to discuss its negative meaning.  i. The negative meaning of correlation  Tillich’s method of correlation replaces three inadequate methods of relat-  ing the contents of the Christian faith to man’s spiritual exi~tence.~ These  inadequate methods are referred to as supranaturalistic, naturalistic or hu-  manistic, and dualistic. We turn first to a discussion of the supranaturalistic  method.  (1) Supranaturalism  The supranaturalistic method sees the Christian message as a “sum of re-  vealed truths which have fallen into the human situation like strange bodies  from a strange world.”? The chief error in this method is found in its failure  to place any emphasis on an analysis of the human situation. According to this  method the truths of the Christian faith create a new situation before they  can be received. At many points the supranaturalistic method has traits of the  docetic-monophysitic heresy, expecially in its valuation of the Bible as a book  of supranatural “oracles” in which human receptivity is completely over-  10oked.~ This method finally ends up seeking to put man in the impossible  position of receiving answers to questions he never has asked.  * Tillich, PE, xxvi.  Tillich, ST, I, 64.  2. Tillich, Protestant Era, p. xxvi: “Question and answer determine each other; if they are  separated, the traditional answers become unintelligible, and the actual questions remain unan-  swered. . . . Philosophy and theology are not separated, and they are not identical, but they are  correlated, and their correlation is the methodological problem of a Protestant theology.”  3. Paul Tillich, Systematic Theology, vol. 1 (Chicago: University of Chicago Press, ig5i), p. 64:  “The method of correlation replaces three inadequate methods of relating the contents of the  Christian faith to man’s spiritual existence.”  4. Tillich, Systematic Theology, p. 65: “In terms of the classical heresies one could say that the  supranaturalistic method has docetic-monophysitic traits, especially in its valuation of the Bible  as a book of supranatural ‘oracles’ in which human receptivity is completely overlooked.” 352 </p><div id="pagenum"><p>The Martin Luther King, Jr. Papers Project </p></div><div id="pagenum"><p>It is chiefly at this point that Tillich criticizes Barth.

It would be a destructive for-  eign substance in culture, a disruptive “non-human” entity within the human  sphere, and could have had no power to shape and direct human history.? 15 Apr  1955  Tillich says in an even sharper criticism of Barth:  The “Grand Inquisitor” is about to enter the Confessional Church, and strictly  speaking, with a strong but tightfitting armor of Barthian Supranaturalism. This  very narrow attitude of the Barthians saved the German Protestant Church; but  it created at the same time a new heteronomy, an anti-autonomous and anti-  humanistic feeling, which I must regard as an abnegation of the Protestant  principle.$  In his Systematic Theology Tillich sets forth his criticism of Barth in still  clearer terms. All theology as he sees it, has a dual function: to state the basic  truth of the Christian faith and to interpret this truth in the existing cultural  situation. In other words, theology has both a “kerygmatic” and an “apolo-  getic’’ function. Barth’s theology performs the first of these tasks admirably.  * Tillich uses the term  heteronomous in relation  to “autonomy” and  “theonomy.” Autonomy  means the obedience of  the individual to the law  of reason, which he finds  in himself as a rational be- ing.6 Heteronomy means  imposing an alien law, re-  ligious or secular on man’s  mind.’ Theonomy is a  kind of higher autonomy.  “It means autonomous  reason united with its own  depth. . . and actualized in obedience to its struc-  tural laws and in the  power of its own inex-  haustible ground.” (ST, I,  85.)S t Tillich, Art. (igyj),  140.  $ Tillich, IOH, 26.  5. Boozer, “Place of Reason,” p. 97: “Tillich is strongly critical of anything of a heteronomous  character.”  6. Tillich, Systematic Theology, p. 84: “Autonomy means the obedience of the individual to the  law of reason, which he finds in himself as a rational being.” This sentence appears in Randall  (“Ontology,” p. 144) without quotation marks.  7. Tillich, Protestant Era, p. 46: “Heteronomy imposes an alien law, religious or secular, on  man’s mind.”  8. Randall, “Ontology,” p. 144: “‘It means autonomous reason united with its own depth . . .  and actualized in obedience to its structural laws and in the power of its own inexhaustible ground  (85).’ ‘Theonomous reason’ is thus for Tillich really a kind of higher autonomy.” Ellipsis in origi-  nal. Randall’s quotation from Tillich is not accurate. Cf. Tillich, Systaatic Theology, p. 85: “It  means autonomous reason united with its own depth. In a theonomous situation reason actualizes  itself in obedience to its structural laws and in the power of its own inexhaustible ground.”  9. Boozer, “Place of Reason,” p. 97: “A completely foreign substance or authority suddenly  thrown at man could have no meaning to man.” The two quotations from Tillich that follow this  sentence also appear in Boozer’s dissertation. 353 </p><div id="pagenum"><p>The Martin Luther King, Jr. Papers Project </p></div><div id="pagenum"><p>15 Apr </p></div><p id="page">1955 By lifting the message above any frozen formula from the past, and above the  very words of the Scripture, Barth has been able to recover the great recur-  rent refrain that runs through all Scripture and Christian teaching. But he  refuses, with the most persistent pertinacity, to undertake the apologetic task  of interpreting the message in the contemporary situation. “The message  must be thrown at those in the situation-thrown like a stone.”” Tillich is  convinced, on the contrary, that it is the unavoidable duty of the theologian  to interpret the message in the cultural situation of his day. Barth persists in  avoiding this function, thus falling into a dogmatic “supranaturalism”. lo  All of this makes it clear that Tillich is adverse to all supranaturalistic meth-  ods. His method of correlation, the basis of his whole theology, is expressly  designed to avoid the pitfalls of supranaturalism without falling back into  idealistic liberalism.”  (2) Naturalism  The method of naturalism is the second method that Tillich rejects as in-  adequate for relating the contents of the Christian faith to man’s spiritual  existence. Naturalism tends to affirm that the answers can be developed out  of human existence itself. Tillich asserts that much of liberal theology fell  victim to this type of naturalistic or humanistic thinking. The tendency was to  put question and answer on the same level of creativity. “Everything was said  by man, nothing to man.”?  Naturalism teaches that there is only one dimension in life, the horizontal  dimension. There is no God who speaks to man beyond human existence.  There is no vertical relationship whatsoever.

Without identifying the message with some  frozen formula from the past, or with the very words of Scripture, Barth has been able to recover  (for a generation that had lost it) the great recurrent refrain that runs through all Scripture and  Christian teaching. . . . But he refuses, as though it were treason, the apologetic task of inter-  preting the message to the contemporary situation. ‘The message must be thrown at those in the  situation-thrown like a stone.’ Tillich is convinced, on the contrary, that it is the unavoidable  duty of the theologian to relate the Christian message to the cultural situation of his day. Barth  persists in dodging this duty, thus falling into a ‘supranaturalism’ that ‘takes the Christian mes-  sage to be a sum of revealed truths which have fallen into the human situation like strange bodies  from a strange world.”’  I 1.

Dualism seeks to build a supranatural structure on a natural substructure. It  divides theology into natural theology and supranatural theology. Tillich ad-  mits that this method, more than any other, is aware of the problem which  the method of correlation tries to meet. It realizes that in spite of the infinite  gap between man’s spirit and God’s spirit, there must be a positive relation  between them. It tries to express this relation by positing a body of theologi-  cal truth which man can reach through so-called “natural revelation”. l5 And  herein lies the falsity of this method; it derives an answer from the form of  the question. Like the naturalistic method, dualism fails to see that the an-  swers must always come from something beyond existence.?  It is essentially at this point that Tillich criticises so-called natural revelation.  There is revelation through nature, but there is no natural revelation. Natural  revelation, if distinguished from revelation through nature, is a contradiction  in terms, for if it is natural knowledge, it is not revelation. Natural knowledge  cannot lead to the revelation of the ground of being. It can lead only to the  question of the ground of being. But this question is asked neither by natural  revelation nor by natural theology. It is the question raised by reason, but  reason cannot answer it. Only revelation can answer it. And this answer is  based on neither natural revelation nor natural theology, but on real revela-  * Tillich, ST, I, 65.  t Tillich, ST, I, 65.  to man from beyond man’s existence. There is no vertical relationship whatsoever. Whatever is is  in man completely.”  13. Boozer, “Place of Reason,” p. 263: “To see everything in terms of the natural is as much  an error as to see everything in terms of the supernatural.”  14. Boozer, “Place of Reason,” p. 263: “Each is partially right in what it affirms, each is par-  tially wrong in what it denies.”  15. Tillich, Systematic Theology, p. 65: “The third method to be rejected can be called ‘dualistic,’  inasmuch as it builds a supranatural structure on a natural substructure. This method, more than  others, is aware of the problem which the method of correlation tries to meet. It realizes that, in  spite of the infinite gap between man’s spirit and God’s spirit, there must be a positive relation  between them. It tries to express this relation by positing a body of theological truth which man  can reach through his own efforts or, in terms of a self-contradictory expression, through ‘natural  revelation.”’ 355 </p><div id="pagenum"><p>The Martin Luther King, Jr. Papers Project </p></div><div id="pagenum"><p>15 Apr </p></div><p id="page">1955 tion. “Natural theology and, even more definitely, natural revelation are  misnomers for the negative side of the revelation of the mystery, for an inter-  pretation of the shock and stigma of nonbeing.””  Tillich is quite certain that the method of correlation solves the historical  and systematic riddle that has been set forth by the method of dualism. It  solves it by resolving so-called natural theology into the analysis of existence  and by resolving so-called supranatural theology into the answers given to the  questions implied in existence.I7  ii. The positive meaning of correlation  We now turn to a discussion of the positive meaning of the method of cor-  relation. The term “correlation” can be used in three ways. It can designate  the correspondence of data; it can designate the logical interdependence of  concepts, as in polar relations; and it can designate the real interdependence  of things or events in structural wholes. In theological construction all three  meanings have important implications. We shall discuss each of these mean-  ings respectively. Then, in order to gain a clearer understanding of the  method of correlation, we may go on to discuss how systematic theology pro-  ceeds in using the method of correlation, and how theology is related to  philosophy.  (1) The correspondence of data  Correlation means correspondence of data in the sense of a correspon-  dence between religious symbols and that which is symbolized by them. It is  * Tillich, ST, I, 120.  16. Tillich, Systematic Theology, pp. 119- 120: ‘“Natural revelation,’ if distinguished from reve-  lation through nature, is a contradiction in terms, for if it is natural knowledge it is not revelation,  and if it is revelation it makes nature ecstatic and miraculous. Natural knowledge about self and  world cannot lead to the revelation of the ground of being. It can lead to the question of the  ground of being, and that is what so-called natural theology can do and must do. But this question  is asked neither by natural revelation nor by natural theology. It is the question of reason about  its own ground and abyss. It is asked by reason, but reason cannot answer it. Revelation can  answer it. And this answer is based neither on a so-called natural revelation nor on a so-called  natural theology. It is based on real revelation, on ecstasy and sign-events.”  17. Tillich, Systematic Theology, pp. 65-66: “The method of correlation solves this historical  and systematic riddle by resolving natural theology into the analysis of existence and by resolving  supranatural theology into the answers given to the questions implied in existence.”  18. Tillich, Systematic Theology, p. 60: “The term ‘correlation’ may be used in three ways. It can  designate the correspondence of different series of data, as in statistical charts; it can designate  the logical interdependence of concepts, as in polar relations; and it can designate the real inter-  dependence of things or events in structural wholes. If the term is used in theology, all three  meanings have important applications.” 356 </p><div id="pagenum"><p>The Martin Luther King, Jr. Papers Project </p></div><div id="pagenum"><p>upon the assumption of this correspondence that all utterances about God’s </p></div><p id="page">nature are made. This correspondence is actual in the  and the nature of man. There is an understandable contact between  God and man because of this common loRos nature.lg  But one cannot stop here because God is always more than ground or rea-  son; God is also abyss. This abyss-nature of God makes it impossible for man  ever to speak about God except in symbolic termszo Since this idea of the  symbol is such a basic facet of Tillich’s thought, we must briefly discuss its  meaning.  Tillich regards every theological expression as being a symbolic utterance.  Since the unconditional is “forever hidden, transcendent and unknowable, it  follows that all religious ideas are symbolical.”* No finite word, form, person  or deed can ever be identified with God. There is an infinite gap between man  and God.tZ1  God, for Tillich, is not an object or being, not even the highest object or  being; therefore, God cannot be approached directly as an object over against  man as subject. The “really Real” grasps man into union with itself. Since for  Tillich the really real transcends everything in the empirical order it is uncon-  ditionally beyond the conceptual sphere. Thus every form or word used to  indicate this awareness must be in the form of myth or symbol. As Tillich  succinctly states: “Offenbarung ist die Form, in welchem das religiose Object  dem religiosen Glauben theoretisch gegeben ist. Mythos ist die Ausdrucks-  form fur den Offenbarungsinhalt.”$zz 15 Apr  nature of God, 1955  * Tillich, RS, X.  t Tillich, ST, I, 65.  $ Tillich, Art. (ig25), 820.  19.

A symbol possesses a necessary  character. It cannot be exchanged. A sign, on the contrary, is impotent and  can be exchanged at will. A religious symbol is not the creation of a subjective  desire or work. If the symbol loses its ontological grounding, it declines and  becomes a mere “thing,” a sign impotent in itself. “Genuine symbols are not  interchangeable at all, and real symbols provide no objective knowledge, but  yet a true awareness.”tZ3 The criterion of a symbol is that through it the un-  conditioned is clearly grasped in its unconditionedness.26  Correlation as the correspondence of data means in this particular case that  there is correspondence between religious symbols and that reality which  * Tillich, Art.

The statements, “all  knowledge of God has a  symbolic character” and  “symbols provide no ob-  jective knowledge, but yet  true awareness” are diffi-  cult to reconcile with each  other. This contradiction  becomes even more pro- nounced in Tillich’s dis-  cussion of the analogia  entis between the finite  andinfinite. On the one  hand he says, “Without  such an analogy nothing  could he said about God.”  On the other hand he  says, “It is not a method  (analogia entis) of discov-  ering truth about  It is very difficult for one  to make much out of such  contradictions.

Urban’s position is that ‘unless  there is “analogy of being” between the “Creator” and the “created,” between being in itself and  being for us, it is perfectly futile to talk of either religious symbolism or religious knowledge.’”  26.

It is polar relationships that fall chiefly under this meaning of correlation.  Correlation, as used here, determines the statements about God and the  world. The world does not stand by itself. Particular being is in correlation  with being-itself. In this second meaning of correlation, then, Tillich moves  beyond epistemological considerations to ontological considerations.‘*  Tillich develops a very elaborate system of ontological elements. These ele-  ments are individualization and participation,* dynamics and form,? and  freedom and destiny.$ Each of these stands in polar relationship with each  other, neither pole existing apart from the other. This ontological polarity is  seen further in being and nonbeing and the finite and infinite. In setting forth  these polar relationships Tillich is attempting to overcome the basic weak-  nesses found in supranaturalism, humanism and dualism. He admits that du-  alism, more than either of the other methods, is aware of the two poles of  reality, but dualism conceives these in a static complementary relationship.  Tillich maintains that these poles are related in dynamic interaction, that one  pole never exists out of relation to the other pole. Herein is one of Tillich’s  basic criticisms of Hegel. Hegel, according to Tillich, transcends the tension  of existential involvement in the concept of a ~ynthesis.9‘~ He identifies exis-  * Tillich, ST, I, 174.  t Tillich, ST, I, 178.  $ Tillich, ST, I, 182.  § Tillich, IOH, 166.  27.

Tillich believes that no existing being can  rise above ambiguity, tension, and -.* Synthesis is reserved for God. Cor-  relation, then, in the sense of logical interdependence of concepts, implies a  polar structure of all existential reality.30  (3) Real interdependence of things  or events  The third meaning of correlation designates the real interdependence of  things or events in structural wholes. The particular relationship which Tillich  is alluding to under this meaning of correlation is the relationship between  God and man, the divine-human relationship. The implication of this view is  clear, viz., that if there is a divine-human correlation God must be partly de-  pendent upon man.31 Such a view has evoked strong protest from theologians  such as Karl Barth. Tillich, in defending his position at this point, has this  significant statement to make:  But although God in his abysmal nature is in no way dependent on man, God  in his self manifestation to man is dependent on the way man receives his  manifestation.?  Here Tillich is apparently saying that God in his essence is to be distinguished  from God revealing himself in e~istence.~’ God as abyss is unconditioned  while God as self-manifesting is conditioned by man’s receipt of the mani-  festation.  Tillich insists throughout that God and man are interdependent.  * Tillich, IOH, 137, 141.  t Tillich, ST, I, 61.  to the other pole. One feels here again that it is upon this issue that Tillich criticizes Hegel. For,  according to Tillich, Hegel transcends the tension of existential involvement in the concept of a  synthesis.”  30. Boozer, “Place of Reason,” pp. 268-269: “Tillich believes that no existing spirit has the  perspective of God, the perspective of synthesis. All existing life is lived in ambiguity, tension,  and s. Correlation in the sense of the logical interdependence of concepts, then, implies a  polar-structure of all existential reality.”  31. Boozer, “Place of Reason,” p. 269: “(3) Real interdependence of things and events. The  third meaning of correlation is the real interdependence of things and events. The particular  relationship about which Tillich speaks under this meaning of correlation is the relationship  between God and man, the divine-human relation. The implication here is clear, that if there is  a divine-human correlation God must be to some extent dependent upon man.” The following  quotation from Tillich appears in Boozer (p. 269).  32. Boozer, “Place of Reason,” p. 269: “Tillich is apparently saying here, that God in his es-  sence is to be distinguished from God revealing himself in existence.” Boozer also quoted the  following passage from Tillich (p. 270). 360 </p><div id="pagenum"><p>The Martin Luther King, Jr. Papers Project </p></div><div id="pagenum"><p>The divine-human relation, and therefore God as well as man within this rela- </p></div><p id="page">tion, changes with the stages of the history of revelation and with the stages of  every personal development. There is a mutual interdependence between “God  for us” and “we for God”. God’s wrath and God’s grace are not contrasts in the  ‘heart’ of God (Luther), in the depth of his being; but they are contrasts in  the divine-human relationship. The divine-human relation is a correlation. The  “divine-human encounter” (Emil Brunner) means something real for both sides.  It is an actual correlation, in the third sense of the term.* 15 Apr  1955  In a real sense, then, God manifests himself in history. This manifestation  is never complete because God as abyss is inexhaustible. But God as loRos is  manifest in history and is in real interdependence with man. The method of  correlation seeks to express this relati~nship.~~  (4) Correlation as existential questions  and theological answers in mutual  interdependence  “The method of correlation,” says Tillich, “explains the contents of the  Christian faith through existential questions and theological answers in mu-  tual interdependence.” t34 In using this method systematic theology first  makes an analysis of the human situation out of which the existential ques-  tions arise, and then proceeds to demonstrate that the symbols used in the  Christian message are the answers to these questions. The analysis of the hu-  man situation is done in terms of “existentialism.” Here the individual be-  comes aware of the fact that he himself is the door to the deeper levels of  reality, and that his own existence reveals something of the nature of existence  generally. Whoever has immediately experienced his own finitude can find  the traces of finitude in everything that exists.35  * Tillich, ST, I, 61.  t Tillich, ST, I, 97.  33.

Philosophy, poetry, drama, the novel, therapeutic psychology, and  sociology all contribute. The theologian organizes these materials in relation  to the answers given by the Christian message. This analysis of existence may  be more penetrating than that of most  philosopher^.^^ Nevertheless the analy-  sis of the “situation” and the development of the “questions” constitute a  “philosophical task.” Though this task is carried out by the theologian, he  does it as a philosopher, and what he sees is determined only by the object as  it is given in his e~perience.~’  After the questions have arisen from an analysis of the human situation,  the Christian message provides the answers. These answers come from be-  yond existence and are taken by systematic theology “from the sources,  through the medium, under the norm.”* Although the answers are spoken to  human existence from beyond it, there is a mutual dependence between ques-  tion and answer. “In respect to content the Christian answers are dependent  on the revelatory events in which they appear; in respect to form they are  dependent on the structure of the questions which they answer.”?  * Tillich, ST, I, 64. A  word might be said con-  cerning Tillich’s concep-  tion of the sources, me-  dium and norm of  systematic theology. Til-  lich sharply rejects the  neo-orthodox claim that  the Bible is the only  source of theology, on the  ground that the Biblical  message could not have  been understood and can-  not be received without  the preparation for it in  religion and culture.  However, the Bible is the basic source, since “it is  the original document  about the events on which  the Christian Church is  founded” (ST, I, 35). In  addition to the Bible, the  sources are church his-  tory, including historical  theology, and the history  of religion and culture.  Experience is the medium  through which the sources  come to us. On this point  Tillich is closer to the  Protestant Reformers  than he is to the theologi-  cal empiricists for whom experience is the main  source of systematic the-  ology. He holds that  “Christian theology is  based on the unique event  Jesus the Christ,” and that  “this event is given to ex-  perience and not derived  from it” (ST, I, 46). The  norm of theology is “the  ‘new Being’ in Jesus as the  Christ.” Here Tillich tran-  scends the norm of both  Roman Catholicism and  traditional Protestantism.  t Tillich, ST, I, 64.  today are called ‘existential.’ . . . And then he has become aware of the fact that he himself is the  door to the deeper levels of reality, that in his own existence he has the only possible approach to  existence itself. . . . Whoever has penetrated into the nature of his own finitude can find the traces  of finitude in everything that exists.”  36. Tillich, Systematic Theology, p. 63: “The analysis of the human situation employs materials  made available by man’s creative self-interpretation in all realms of culture. Philosophy contrib-  utes, but so do poetry, drama, the novel, therapeutic psychology, and sociology. The theologian  organizes these materials in relation to the answer given by the Christian message. In the light of  this message he may make an analysis of existence which is more penetrating than that of most  philosophers.”  37. Thomas, “Method and Structure,” p. 98, quoting Tillich, Systematic Theology, p. 64: “The  analysis of the ‘situation’ and the development of the ‘questions’ constitute a ‘philosophical task.’ 362 </p><div id="pagenum"><p>The Martin Luther King, Jr. Papers Project </p></div><div id="pagenum"><p>We can better understand the method of correlation if we look at an ex- </p></div><p id="page">ample of its application: the “question” of Reason and the “answer” of Reve-  lati~n.~~ After one analyzes man’s rationality, especially his cognitive ratio-  nality, it is revealed that under the conditions of existence reason falls into  “self-destructive conflicts” with itself. The polarity of “structure” and “depth”  within reason produces a conflict between “autonomous” and “heterono-  mous” tendencies, and this conflict leads to “the quest for theonomy.” The  polarity between “static” and “dynamic” elements within reason leads to a con-  flict between “absolutism” and “relativism.” This leads to “the quest for the  concrete-absolute.’’ The polarity between “formal” and “emotional” elements  produces a conflict between “formalism” and “irrationalism,” and this conflict  leads to the “quest for the union of form and mystery.” “In all three cases,”  says Tillich, “reason is driven to the quest for revelation.” * Also a dilemma  arises between “controlling” knowledge and “receiving” knowledge. “Control-  ling knowledge is safe but not ultimately significant, while receiving knowl-  edge can be ultimately significant, but it cannot give certainty.”? This dilemma  leads to the quest for revelation which gives a truth which is both certain and  of ultimate concern. The “final revelation” in Jesus Christ, Tillich argues,  gives the answers to these questions implied in the existential conflicts of rea-  son. It liberates and reintegrates reason and thus fulfills it.39 It overcomes the  conflict between autonomy and heteronomy by re-establishing their essential  unity.40 Says Tillich, 15 Apr  1955  * Tillich, ST, I, 83.  t Tillich, ST, I, 105.

The  polarity of ‘structure’ and ‘depth’ within reason produces a conflict between ‘autonomous’ and  ‘heteronomous’ tendencies, and this conflict leads to ‘the quest for theonomy.’ The polarity be-  tween ‘static’ and ‘dynamic’ elements within reason leads to a conflict between ‘absolutism’ and  ‘relativism.’ This leads to ‘the quest for the concrete-absolute.’ The polarity between ‘formal’ and  ‘emotional’ elements produces a conflict between ‘formalism’ and ‘irrationalism.’ This leads to  ‘the quest for the union of form and mystery.’ ‘In all three cases,’ Tillich remarks, ‘reason is driven  to the quest for revelation’ (83). Also a dilemma arises between ‘controlling’ knowledge and ‘re-  ceiving’ knowledge. ‘Controlling knowledge is safe but not ultimately significant, while receiving  knowledge can be ultimately significant, but it cannot give certainty.’ This ‘dilemma’ leads to the  quest for revelation which gives a truth which is both certain and of ultimate concern (105). The  ‘final revelation’ in Jesus as the Christ, Tillich argues, gives the ‘answers’ to these ‘questions’ by  overcoming the conflicts within reason. It liberates and reintegrates reason and thus fulfills it  ( I~o).”  40.

Again, the final reve-  lation in Christ overcomes the conflict between the formal and the emotional  elements in reason through the participation of the whole of a person’s life in  it and the consequent bringing together of all the elements of reason.41  We have described the “method of correlation” and illustrated its applica-  tion by reference to the correlation of the “question” of Reason with the “an-  swer’’ of Revelation.

It arises out of the philosophical shock,  the tremendous impetus of the questions: What is the meaning of being? Why is  there being and not not-being? What is the character in which every being par-  ticipates?. . . . Philosophy primarily does not ask about the special character of  the beings, the things and events, the ideas and values, the souls and bodies  which share being. Philosophy asks what about this being itself. Therefore, all  philosophers have developed a “first philosophy”, as Aristotle calls it, namely, an  interpretation of being. . . . This makes the division between philosophy and  theology impossible, for, whatever the relation of God, world, and man may be,  it lies in the frame of being; and any interpretation of the meaning and structure  of being as being unavoidably such has consequences for the interpretation of  God, man, and the world in their interrelations.*44 is clearly set forth in the following paragraph:  This rather lengthy quotation reveals that Tillich conceives of philosophy  as basically ontology.? He affirms that the Kantians are wrong in making epis-  temology the true first philosophy, for as later Neo-Kantians like Nicolai Hart-  mann have recognized, epistemology demands an ontological Since  knowing is an act which participates in being, every act of knowing refers at  the same time to an interpretation of being.  The attempt of logical positivism and related schools to reduce philosophy  to logical calculus has also been unsuccessful. Logical positivism cannot avoid  the ontological question.  There is always at least one problem about which logical positivism, like all se-  mantic philosophies, must make a decision. What is the relation of signs, sym-  bols, or logical operations to reality? Every answer to this question says some-  thing about the structure of being. It is ontological.*  * Tillich, PE, 85. syllable “meta” in meta- ings has received the  t Tillich regards the tra- physics, which in spite of meaning of something be-  ditional term “metaphys- the testimony of all text-  ics” as too abused and dis- books on philosophy that  torted to be longer of any it means the book after  service.

In this sense, theology and philosophy converge. Neither  the theologian nor the philosopher can avoid the ontological q~estion.~’  Though both philosophy and theology deal with the structure of being,  they deal with it from different perspectives. Philosophy asks the question of  the structure of being in itself; theology deals with the meaning of being for  “Theology deals with what concerns us inescapably, ultimately, uncon-  ditionally.”* There are two ways in which the ultimate concern can be consid-  ered. It can be looked at as an event beside other events to be described in  detached objectivity; or it can be understood as an event in which he who  considers it is existentially involved. In the first case the philosopher of reli-  gion is at work. In the second the theologian speaks. The philosopher of re-  ligion is only theoretically concerned with the ultimate concern, while the  theologian’s interpretation of the ultimate concern is itself a matter of ultimate  concern .49  Theology at its best unites two elements, viz., the existential and the me-  thodical. Theology is the existential and methodical interpretation of an ulti-  mate concern. Theological propositions, therefore, are those which deal with  an object in so far as it is related to an ultimate concern. On the basis of this  criterion, no object is excluded from theology, not even a piece of stone; and  no object is in itself a matter of theology, not even God.50 Tillich is certain that  this criterion “makes theology absolutely universal, on the one hand, and ab-  solutely definite, on the other hand.”?  So we can see that the first point of divergence between the philosopher  and the theologian is found in their cognitive attitude. The philosopher seeks  * Tillich, PE, 87.  t Tillich, Art.

For the theologian the interpretation of the ultimate concern is itself a  matter of ultimate concern.”  50.

So in this sense the philosopher is like the scientist.  The theologian, quite differently, does not seek to be detached from his  object. He is involved in it. He seeks a personal relationship with it. In other  words, the attitude of the theologian is commitment to its 15 Apr  1955  He is involved-with the whole of his existence, with his finitude and his anxiety,  with his self-contradiction and despair, with the healing forces in him and in his  social situation. . . . Theology is necessarily existential, and no theology can es-  cape the theological circle.*  Another point of divergence between the philosopher and the theologian  is the difference in their sources. The philosopher looks at the whole of reality  and seeks to discover within it the structure of reality. He assumes that there  is an identity between the loRos of reality as a whole and the loRos working in  him, so he looks to no particular place to discover the structure of being. The  place to look is all places.53  The theologian, on the other hand, finds the source of his knowledge not  in the universal m, but in the loaos “who became flesh,” and the medium  through which he receives knowledge of the logos is not common rationality,  but the Church.  A third point of divergence which Tillich finds between philosophy and  theology is a difference in their content. The philosopher deals with the cate-  gories of being in relation to the material which is structured by them, while  the theologian relates the same categories to the quest for a “new being.” The  philosopher deals with causality as it appears in physics, while the theologian  discusses causality in relation to a first cause, i.e. the ground of the whole  series of causes. The philosopher analyzes biological or historical time and  discusses astronomical as well as microcosmic space, but the theologian deals  with time in relation to eternity and space in relation to man’s existential  * Tillich, ST, I, 23.  51.

The philosopher like the theo-  logian is caught in an existential situation and has an ultimate concern,  whether he realizes it or not. Even the most scientific philosopher must admit  this, for if an ultimate concern were lacking, his philosophy would be devoid  of passion, seriousness, and ~reativity.~~ “Every creative philosopher,” says Til-  lich, “is a hidden theologian.”?  The theologian is also confronted with the same burden. In order to estab-  lish the universal validity of what concerns him ultimately, he like the philoso-  pher must seek to be detached from his existential situation and seek obedi-  ence to the universal m. He must take the risk of standing outside of the  theological circle. $  The conclusion that Tillich draws from the duality of divergence and con-  vergence in the relation between theology and philosophy is that there is nei-  ther conflict nor synthesis between theology and philo~ophy.~~ A conflict pre-  supposes a common basis on which to fight. But then there is no common  basis between theology and philo~ophy.~~ When the theologian enters the  philosophical arena, he must enter it as a philosopher; only as a philosopher  can he be in conflict with another philosopher, that is, he must make his ap-  peal to reason al0ne.0~~  There can be no synthesis of philosophy and theology for the same reason:  there is no “common basis” on which they can meet.

Wieman’s scientific method  Throughout his writings Wieman contends that the only way to gain true  knowledge is through the scientific method. He is convinced that all knowl-  edge must depend ultimately upon science, since “science is nothing else than  the refined process of knowing.”? The scientific method is the very center of  Wieman’s thought. As Van Dusen puts it:  Scientific Method is more than a thread running through all Professor Wieman’s  writings; it is not too much to say that it is the central pivot around which every-  thing else must revolve and in relation to which it must take its reference and  obtain its validity.*  In accepting the scientific method as the only way to distinguish between  truth and error, Wieman automatically rejects most traditional “ways of know-  ing.” In order to gain a clearer understanding of Wieman’s use of the scientific  method we may briefly discuss some tests of truth he rejects.  i. Tests of truth which Wieman rejects  It is often claimed that religious knowledge is peculiarly derived from reve-  lation or faith or authority.‘jO Wieman emphatically rejects each of these tests  of truth. We may discuss Wieman’s view of them in order.  * Tillich, ST, I, 28.  t Wieman, RESM, 23.  $ Van Dusen, Art. (igsi), 711  59.

There-  fore there can be no such thing as a ‘Christian philosophy.’ Indeed, the ideal of a ‘Christian  philosophy’ is a self-contradictory one, because it denotes ‘a philosophy which does not look at  the universal logos but at the assumed or actual demands of a Christian theology’ (28). Of course,  any Western thinker may be a ‘Christian philosopher’ in the sense of one whose thinking has been  in some measure shaped by the Christian tradition, but an ‘intentionally’ Christian philosopher  is a contradiction in terms because the philosopher must ‘subject himself’ to nothing but being as  he experiences it.”  60. Henry Nelson Wieman, The Source of Human Good (Chicago: University of Chicago Press,  1946), p. 214: “It is often claimed that religious knowledge is peculiarly derived from revelation 369 </p><div id="pagenum"><p>The Martin Luther King, Jr. Papers Project </p></div><div id="pagenum"><p>‘5 AP- (1) Revelation </p></div><p id="page">‘955  Some things are held to be true because it is claimed that they are revealed  by God to man.fi1 The Barthian theologians would insist, for instance, that the  only avenue for religious truth is through revelation. Even Tillich, as we have  seen, affirms that the final revelation in Jesus Christ gives answers to the ques-  tions implied in the existential conflicts of reason. Wieman, however, seeks to  show that revelation provides no access to truth beyond the bounds of obser-  vation, agreement of observers, and coherence. Revelation in itself is not  knowledge, notwithstanding the fact that revelation may be an avenue to  knowledge.fi2 Revelation for Wieman is “the lifting of the creative event to a  place of domination in the devotion of a continuing fellowship to form one  enduring strand of history.”” This lifting to a place of domination was not  done by man, but by such events as the life and teaching of Jesus, the Cruci-  fixion; the Resurrection; and the forming of the fellowship. The cheif conse-  quence of this revelation is not an unveiling of knowledge, but the release of  creative power to transform the world into richness of value. The immediate  consequence of revelation is faith and salvation, rather than knowledge. In  time, however, the religious man gains a knowledge from revelation that he  could never have gained without. But this knowledge of revelation, if and  when it is attained, demands the same tests of truth as any other kn~wledge.~~  Wieman finds revelation to be an inadequate test of truth because it ulti-  mately has to throw us back to some further test. Even if it be affirmed that  truth is what God reveals, one must still ascertain what is revelation and what  not. One may claim that the Holy Spirit shows what is truly revelation. But  how can one know he has the Holy Spirit? In other words, one cannot know  what is revelation by further revelation from the Holy Spirit.

For Wieman, however, faith is not knowledge pri-  marily, but is a ~elf-giving.~~ Faith is  the act of deciding to live in a way required by the source of human good, to  maintain association with a fellowship practicing that commitment, to follow the  rituals designed to renew and deepen this commitment, to search one’s self for  hidden disloyalties to this devotion, to confess and repudiate these disloyalties.*  “Since faith is an act,” says Wieman, “it is neither a belief going beyond the  evidence nor knowledge.”? It may be guided by the most thoroughly tested  and accurate knowledge. But never does human knowledge plumb the full  depths of the reality commanding religious commitment of faith. Even when  the beliefs directing religious commitment become knowledge of the most  precise and thoroughly tested sort, still the knowledge never exhausts the  reality commanding faith.$66  (3) Authority  Another test of truth which Wieman rejects is that of authority.

It demands that all three enter into the forming, the correcting and  the validating of any belief about any reality. These three tests of truth apply  to every proposition alleged to be true, whether it is in the field of common  sense, science, philosophy, or religion.  Wieman seeks to make it clear at every point that the scientific method is  not to be confused with positivism, the view that we get our knowledge from  sensation alone. Sensation alone can never give knowledge. Neither can ab-  stract reason alone yield knowledge. First observation under the control of  reason must discover some order in the field of sensuous experience. After  discovering such an order, it becomes possible to follow it by pure reason  beyond the reach of sensuous experience. But the starting point is what is  sensible, and it is necessary to be able to come back to what is sensible for  verification. So according to this method, knowledge is not limited to sensa-  tion, but neither can it dispense with sensation.  It might be well at this point to say a few words concerning Wieman’s con-  ception of observation, since it commands such a central position in Wieman’s  methodology. Observation is a series of perceptual events. The perceptual  event is not merely sense data.73 The perceptual event “includes everything  within and without the biological organism, which experiment can demon-  strate makes a difference to conscious awareness when the perceptual reaction  occurs.”? When the perceptual event is so interpreted it is clearly seen that is  is only an infinitesimal part of the total universe. Innumerable happenings  are constantly occurring in the wide reaches of the world which make no  difference whatsoever to the conscious awareness accompanying the percep-  tual reaction of the organism.74  Many structures are present or ingredient in every perceptual event. Far  fewer are common to a sequence of such events. From these that are common,  selective attention picks out one, and that is what is perceived.75  * Wieman, Art. (1936)’, 184.  t Wieman, SHG, 182.  73. Wieman, Source of Human Good, p. 181: “Observation, as here understood, is a series of  perceptual events. The perceptual event is not merely sense data.”  74. Wieman, Source of Human Good, p. 182: “Complex and intricate as the perceptual event is,  when so interpreted, it is only an infinitesimal part of the total universe. Experiment easily shows  that innumerable happenings can occur in the wide reaches of the world, and even in close  proximity to the organism, perhaps also in it, which make no difference whatsoever to the con-  scious awareness accompanying the perceptual reaction of the organism.”  75. Wieman, Source of Human Good, p. 182: “Innumerable structures are ingredient in every  perceptual event. Far fewer are common to a sequence of such events. From these that are com-  mon, selective attention picks out one, and that is what we perceive.” 373 </p><div id="pagenum"><p>The Martin Luther King, Jr. Papers Project </p></div><div id="pagenum"><p>15 Apr </p></div><p id="page">1955 Wieman is convinced that all knowledge is achieved by perception, even  metaphysical knowledge. The only difference between metaphysical knowl-  edge and other forms of knowledge is that the former is achieved “by a more  elaborate analysis of perceptual events to the end of discovering structures  not merely common to a selected series but those essential to all perceptual  events whatsoever.”” Time and space, for example, are essential ingredients  in every perceptual event. This is discovered by an analysis of perceptual  events. Wieman thinks that all categories sought by metaphysical or other  philosophical inquiry can be uncovered by proper analysis of the perceptual  As we shall see subsequently, even God is known by way of percep-  tion. So we can say that, for Wieman, observation enters into all cases of get-  ting genuine knowledge.” Not even reason can gain knowledge without ob-  servation. There must be a working together of the two. In the final analysis  the scientific method means “observation under control of reason, and reason  under the control of observation.”$  Wieman also stresses the point that the scientific method requires the ut-  most use of imagination. Nothing of great importance can be discovered with-  out the great power of imagination. The imagination is needed to construct a  theoretical order. But all such imagination must be constantly under the con-  trol of reason and observation, else it will give us only the constructions of  human fancy and build around us a wall of dreams to shut out objective  reality.  In his book, The Issues of Life, Wieman analyzes the scientific method in  four steps:  (1) Forming an idea of what course of action will produce specified conse-  quences by observing various consequences that have issued from specified  conditions.$  (2) Ascertain as accurately as possible just what are the conditions under  which this course of action can be profitably followed to produce the desired  and anticipated consequences.

Here it is again made  explicit that the only valid test of any belief is observation combined with  reason. In order to gain a clearer understanding of Wieman’s use of the sci-  entific method, we turn to a discussion of the knowledge of God through the  scientific method. 15 Apr  ‘955 idea was tested, namely by steps one, two, and three just described.*78  iii. Knowledge of God through the  scientific method  Wieman rejects the view that knowledge of God is a special kind of knowl-  edge which comes through special faculties like feeling, intuition, faith, and  moral will. It is true that all of these designate a kind of immediate experience  which provides the data that may lead to the knowledge of God. But it is  erroneous to identify knowledge with immediate experience. “Immediate ex-  perience never yields knowledge, althought it is one indispensable ingredient  in knowledge inasmuch as it provides the data from which knowledge may be  derived.” t  All of this leads Wieman to affirm emphatically that we know God just as  we know any other object; that there are no other faculties of knowledge  except those by which we know ordinary objects.  The method by which Wieman seeks to gain knowledge of God is the same  as that used to gain knowledge of any other object, viz., the scientific method.  As we have seen above, Wieman is quite certain that without this scientific  method we have no accurate method of verifying our ideas or of distinguish-  ing between truth and error.79  Wieman admits that because of the exceeding complexity of the data of  * Weiman, IOL, 187-188.  t Wieman, RESM, 22.  78.

But all effort on the part of religious thinkers must be in that  direction.  Only by developing a scientific technique which is fit and able to interpret cor-  rectly the significance of that which is given in immediate experience when im-  mediate experience is at that flood-tide called mysticism can God be known. It is  probable He can never be known completely; but we can increase our knowledge  of Him by contemplation which draws on mysticism from one side and from  scientific method on the other.*  Wieman proceeds to formulate the requirements for a scientific knowledge  In moving toward a more adequate, Le., a more scientific knowledge of God,  even though we approach from afar off, three things are required: (1) a clarifi-  cation of the type of experience which can be called distinctively religious; (2) an  analysis or elucidation of that datum in this experience which signifies the object  being experienced and (3) inference concerning the nature of this object.? of God in the following manner:  In order to assure the success of the scientific method in obtaining knowl-  edge of God men will have to relinquish all claim to knowledge of God except  that obtainable by the combination of observation and reason. Sense experi-  ence of God is the first indispensable step in acquisition of knowledge of God  through the scientific method. But the element of sense experience is only  one side of the pole. The data of sense must be subjected to the scrutiny of  reflection.  For Wieman, the adequacy of one’s concept of God must ultimately be  tested by three questions: 1. Does the concept designate that something in all  being upon which human life must depend and to which humans must adjust,  in order to attain the greatest possibilities of good? 2. Does it deal adequately  with the problem of evil? 3. Is it true to religious experience.$  There can be no doubt, asserts Wieman, that men are persistently meeting  a reality like this. This reality must be God. When men come to the point of  living the contemplative life, they know more about this God.§  Wieman continually affirms that God is an object of perception. He is just  as capable of being perceived as any other object in the physical world.# Per-  * Wieman, RESM,  84-85.  t Wieman, RESM, 33.  $ Wieman, WRT, 198.  8 By the contemplative  life Wieman does not  mean a life of passive re-  flection, but a life which  includes both maximum awareness and appreci-  ation of sense experience.  # Wieman admits that  the perception by which  God is known is “percep-  tion wherein the analysis  and the search are carried  much further than the  automatic and habitual analysis and selection  made by automatic reac-  tions of the organism.”  (SHG, 183) These are suf-  ficient for perceiving hills  and houses, but not for  perceiving God, “the ever-  lasting creative event.”80  3y6 80.

The development of meanings and  perceptual events pertaining to God is the work of that creativity which gener-  ated all meanings.* 15 Apr  ‘955 God provides the preliminary conditions for perception of himself.  But even after these meanings, perceptual events, and structures have been  There are special commitments, discipline, and practices, as well as the general  procedures of all empirical inquiry, to which men must subject themselves to  perceive God after revelation is accomplished, just as they must do this to attain  knowledge of any other complex object of cognition.? provided, men do not necessarily perceive God.  From this interpretation of revelation Wieman seeks to explain why God is  hidden. He sets forth the following four explanations for God’s hiddenness.  (1) God is hidden where and when he has not revealed himself. (2) He is  hidden where and when men will not follow the methods and submit to the  disciplines necessary to achieve true perception. (3) He is hidden when men  hold to myth and revelation as a kind of knowledge. (4) He is hidden when  men’s appreciations and evaluations are so formed and directed that they can-  not appreciate the divine significance of that creativity which generates all real  value.$.81 When the idea of the hiddenness of God is so interpreted, Wieman  is certain that a major stumbling block to the perception of God is removed.  Another misunderstanding which must be removed if God is to be per-  ceived is that concerning the nature and function of myth. “Myth,” says Wie-  man, “is a statement, rather complex as a rule by which conduct, attitude, and  devotion are directed to deal religiously with important reality without intel-  lectual understanding of what they really mean.”§ Wieman admits that myth,  while lacking cognitive proficiency, possesses pragmatic efficacy. It may even  be indispensable in dealing with some of the most important and complex  realities because of the limitations of man’s intellectual understanding. The  * Wieman, Art.

The pragmatic efficacy of the  myth in directing one to important reality is simply a fact. It simply happens  when and if it does happen. These happenings either occur or do not. When  they occur, they are neither true nor false. Only propositions about them can  be true or false.s2  The myth when rightly interpreted is seen to be a valuable way of directing  conduct and devotion to important reality. But when myth is thought to be  knowledge it confuses the mind and makes impossible perceptual knowledge  of God.  A final confusion which Wieman seeks to dissipate in order to make percep-  tual knowledge of God possible pertains to the work of theology.83 He thinks  that the work of theology should be limited to the job of  criticizing and revising the myths so that they will continue to be efficacious and  reliable guides to God within the changing context of the prevailing culture.?  Since myths will always be there, some field of expert scholarship must be  devoted to the task. When theology goes beyond this and pursues the cogni-  tive job of getting knowledge of God, it ends in a morass of confusion and  fu tility.84  * Wieman, Art.

This point of the perception of God is so important to Wieman be-  cause he is seeking to be a thoroughgoing empiricist at every point. That  which cannot be observed does not exist. 15 Apr  1955  3. A comparison and evaluation of the  methodologies of Tillich and Wieman  The methodologies of Tillich and Wieman are quite divergent at many  points. As we have seen, Wieman contends that one only gains true knowl-  edge through the scientific method. All knowledge, whether it is knowledge  of God or knowledge of a stick or stone, is obtained through the scientific  method. With this contention, Tillich is in strong disagreement. He looks  upon this “methodological imperialism” as being as dangerous as political im-  perialism, for, like the latter, “it breaks down when the independent elements  of reality revolt against it.”* It is Tillich’s conviction that the adequacy of a  method cannot be decided a priori; rather it is continually being decided in  the cognitive process itself. For Tillich, method and system determine each  other, making it absolutely erroneous for any method to claim to be adequate  for every subject.85  Another point of disagreement between Tillich and Wieman is on the ques-  tion of existential participation. Wieman’s attempt to be a thoroughgoing em-  piricist causes him to look askance upon anything that smacks of existential-  ism. He seeks to deal with the data of theology through detached objectivity.  Tillich, on the other hand, is convinced that the existential factor cannot be  eliminated from theology. And so he contends, contrary to Wieman, that the-  ology can never be an “empirical science.” The object of theology, asserts Til-  lich, is not an object within the whole of scientific experience. Theology does  not deal with objects that can be “discovered by detached observation,” or  “tested by scientific methods of verification.” In these methods the testing  subject is always outside the test situation. But the object of theology, says  Tillich, can be verified only by a participation in which the testing theologian  risks himself in the ultimate sense of “to be or not to be.”s6 Tillich contends  * Tillich, ST, I, 60.  85. Tillich, Systematic Theology, p. 60: “Whether or not a method is adequate cannot be decided  a priori; it is continually being decided in the cognitive process itself. Method and system deter-  mine each other. Therefore, no method can claim to be adequate for every subject.”  86. Horton, “Tillich’s Role in Contemporary Theology,” p. 39: “Macintosh and Wieman have  claimed that theology is an ‘empirical science’ in this sense; Tillich finds the claim entirely  groundless. Theology does not deal with objects that can be ‘discovered by detached observation’  or ‘tested by scientific methods of verification,’ which always eliminate the personal equation. ‘The 379 </p><div id="pagenum"><p>The Martin Luther King, Jr. Papers Project </p></div><div id="pagenum"><p>15 Apr </p></div><p id="page">1955 that “this test is never finished not even in a complete life of experience. An  element of risk remains and makes an experimental verification in time and  space impossible.” *  Tillich thinks that the demand for existential participation is confirmed by  the results of scientific-experiential theology itself. Without such an existential  participation Wieman’s “creative process,” for instance, is a nonreligious con-  cept: with it, it is no longer a scientific concept.87 Tillich is certain that “in no  case can scientific experience as such produce a foundation and source of  systematic theology.”t  Tillich does not totally eliminate the empirical factor from his theological  method. Like Wieman, he sees the importance of the empirical factor in the-  ology. But he is not willing to carry it as far as Wieman. Tillich prefers to  stand “on the boundary” between Barth and Wieman on the issue of theo-  logical empirici~rn.~~  When it comes to the question of the rational factor in theological method-  ology, both Tillich and Wieman concur on its importance. We have seen how  Wieman applies rational inference to sensory observation and experimental  behavior to achieve the proper results of the scientific method. We have also  seen how Tillich employs semantic, logical, and methodological rationality in  his theological system. Tillich insists that the dialetical character of his method  of correlation does not mean that it is opposed to logic and rationality; for  “dialectics follows the movement of thought or movement of reality through  yes and no, but it describes it in logically correct terms.”$ So for Tillich and  Wieman reason plays an important part in methodological construction.  Tillich goes beyond Wieman, however, by insisting that reason needs reve-  lation. Therefore revelation receives a very prominent place in the method-  ology of Tillich. He holds that the final revelation in Jesus Christ gives answers  to the questions implied in the existential conflicts of reason. Wieman seeks to  * Tillich, ST, I, 44.  t Tillich, ST, I, 44.  $ Tillich, ST, I, 56.  object of theology can be verified only by a participation in which the testing theologian risks  himself in the ultimate sense of “to be or not to be.””’  87. Horton, “Tillich’s Role in Contemporary Theology,” p. 39: “Without such an existential  participation Wieman’s ‘creative process’ and Brightman’s ‘cosmic person’ are nonreligious con-  cepts; with it, they are no longer ‘scientific’ concepts.”  88. King submitted a draft of this chapter that ended with this paragraph. Schilling com-  mented: “Here you should go on to show what you think of Ws criticism.

Til-  lich would agree that revelation adds nothing to the totality of our ordinary  knowledge, i.e., to our knowledge about the subject-object structure of re-  alit~.~’ But he would disagree with Wieman’s assertion that revelation medi-  ates no form of knowledge. Tillich affirms that revelation mediates knowledge  about the mystery of being to us, not about beings and their relation to one  another. There is one other qualification that Tillich makes concerning knowl-  edge of revelation, namely, that it can be received only in the situation of  revelation, and it can be communicated-in contrast to ordinary knowledge-  only to those who participate in this situation. According to this view, reve-  lation cannot interfere with knowledge that is ordinary. Likewise, ordinary  knowledge cannot interfere with knowledge of revelati~n.~~  Several points concerning Wieman’s scientific method and Tillich’s method  of correlation require comment.  1. Wieman insists that the religious inquirer seeking knowledge of God  must stick to what is immediately given within the fluid process of “sensory  experience, experimental behavior and rational inference.” 93 This is what  Wieman means by the requirements of thoroughgoing empiricism. Such a  method seeks to eliminate faith and analogical reference from the quest for  knowledge of God.  But is it possible to eliminate faith and analogical reference from genuine  knowledge of God, or from any knowledge for that matter? The outcome of  such an elimination would be, as Santayana has shown, a “solipsism of the  present moment.”* Without faith and recourse to analogy it is impossible to  develop a working knowledge of the actual world.  Certainly Wieman is not consistent in his attempt to eliminate faith and  analogical reference from the quest for knowledge of God. He says, for in-  stance, that “the terms ‘process’ and ‘interaction’ apply to everything that ex- 15 Apr  1955  * Santayana, SAF, 14-18,  go. King used the previous two sentences earlier in this chapter; see p. 370 in this volume.  91. Tillich, Systematic Theology, p. log: “Nor does [revelation] add anything directly to the to-  tality of our ordinary knowledge, namely, to our knowledge about the subject-object structure of  reality.”  92. Tillich, Systematic Theology,.pp. 129- 130: “Knowledge of revelation is knowledge about the  revelation of the mystery of being to us, not information about the nature of beings and their  relation to one another. Therefore, the knowledge of revelation can be received only in the  situation of revelation, and it can be communicated-in contrast to ordinary knowledge-only to  those who participate in this situation. . . . Knowledge of revelation cannot interfere with ordinary  knowledge. Likewise, ordinary knowledge cannot interfere with knowledge of revelation.”  93. This quotation is from Wieman, “Authority and the Normative Approach,” p. 184. </p><div id="pagenum"><p>The Martin Luther King, Jr. Papers Project </p></div><div id="pagenum"><p>15Apr </p></div><p id="page">1955 ists because everything in existence is a process and interacts with other  things.”” But how is this known? Certainly not by direct observation. In such  affirmations one must assume that what lies beyond observation is analogous  to what is observed. Since it is possible to observe only an infinitesimal portion  of all that has been, is, and will be, it can be truly said that any assertion made  about anything that exists will involve a bold use of analogy.  2. One of the weak points of the scientific method in religion is that this  method omits so much valid experience. Science must inevitably be selective  and exclusive. In a world of such infinite variety and richness, science by the  nature of its instruments and procedures must limit itself to a few items or  elements within that richness. Thus a vast wealth of potential experience is  always deliberately ignored in any scientific endeavor. Whatever may be the  merit of the foregoing, the surprising thing is that Wieman states categori-  cally: “We do not yet have any knowledge of God that we can call scientific.”  This would seem to mean that the purely scientific methodology is a hope and  not a fact.  3. Even if the scientific method were a fact it would hardly be adequate for  religion. The scientific method requires that the investigator maintain a de-  tached objectivity toward his object. He must seek to exclude all personal and  historical conditions which might destroy his longing for objectivity. The theo-  logian, on the other hand, does not seek to be detached from his object. He  seeks a personal relationship with it. In other words, the attitude of the theo-  logian is commitment to his object. Tillich’s criticism of Wieman’s method at  this point is quite sound.  4. It seems that Tillich begs the question as to the relation between philoso-  phy and theology in his contention that the philosopher seeks the truth only  in the whole of reality, and never looks for it in any particular place. There is  nothing to prevent a philosopher from finding the key to the nature of reality  in a particular part of reality. Indeed this is what the creative philosopher has  done all along. He takes as his starting point some particular aspect of reality  which seems to him to provide the clue to an understanding of reality as a  whole.94  Now the philosopher who is a Christian does not differ from other philos-  ophers in starting with a belief which he takes as the key to reality. He finds  the key to reality in the event of God’s revelation in Jesus the Christ. This does  * Wieman, Art. (1936)’, 430.  94. Thomas, “Method and Structure,” p. 101: “But Tillich begs the question as to the relation  between philosophy and theology when he asserts that the philosopher seeks the truth only in  ‘the whole of reality,’ ‘the universal logos of being,’ and never looks for it in any particular place.  For there is nothing to prevent a philosopher from finding the key to the nature of reality in a  concrete manifestation, a particular part of reality. Indeed, every creative philosopher must take  as his starting point some part or aspect of reality which seems to him to provide the clue to an  understanding of reality as a whole.” 382 </p><div id="pagenum"><p>The Martin Luther King, Jr. Papers Project </p></div><div id="pagenum"><p>not mean that having found the key in a particular event, he should cease to </p></div><p id="page">look at the universal structure of being. The fact that he has found the key en-  ables him to look at the structure of being with a clearer understanding of it.95  So it seems that Tillich’s contention that there can be no Christian philoso-  phy is somewhat exaggerated. He thinks that the ideal of a Christian philoso-  phy is impossible because philosophy must approach the structure of being  with detachment and without reference to its meaning for us. Yet Tillich him-  self, admits that every great philosopher has an ultimate concern, and has  been in a sense a theologian. If this is so the distinction between philosophy  and theology is relative, not absolute. Therefore Tillich’s effort to distinguish  between theology and philosophy in the last analysis breaks down.*g6  5. In seeking to distinguish between philosophy and theology it seems that  Tillich leaves a too sharp dualism between the theoretical and existentialism  or “practical.” This is one of the things that both existentialism and American  instrumentalism have sought to break down. As J. H. Randall, Jr. puts it, “The  theoretical interest or ‘pure reason,’ . . . is not something opposed to the prac-  tical and existential. Rather, theory and detached objectivity are moments or  stages in a broader context or matrix of ‘practice’.”t Tillich is quite aware of  this, but he still does not entirely free himself of the old Kantian dualism in  which “pure reason” is set over against “practical reason.” Tillich fails to take  the existential character of theory seriously enough.97 15 Apr  1955  * For a further elabora- t Randall, Art.

But the fact that he has found the key enables him to  look at the structure of being with a clearer understanding of it.”  96. Thomas, “Method and Structure,” p. 102: “The main reason Tillich rejects the possibility  of such a Christian philosophy is that he thinks philosophy must approach the structure of being  with detachment and without existential concern. For it is only on this supposition that philoso-  phy has to be restricted to the purely ‘critical’ task of analyzing the structure of being without  reference to its meaning for us. Yet Tillich himself admits that the creative philosophers have  been moved by an ultimate concern, and hence have been in a sense theologians. If so, the dis-  tinction between philosophy and theology is relative, not absolute.” In the margin on a draft of  this chapter Schilling wrote that King’s “criticism [was] well-grounded & developed.” He asked  next to the last sentence: “What about his @ point of divergence?” (King, Draft of chapter 2).  97.

The question of being  It is impossible to understand Tillich’s conception of God without a prior  knowledge of his ontology as a whole, since it is his ultimate position that “God  is being-iteelf.” To attempt to understand Tillich’s conception of God with-  out an understanding of his conception of being is like trying to understand  the humanistic conception of God without understanding its conception of  man. So we may well begin our study with a discussion of Tillich’s ontological  position.  Tillich insists that the core of philosophy is the ontological question, and  this ontological question is logically prior to every other. Thought must start  with being; it cannot go behind it. Ontology is possible because there are con-  cepts less universal than “being,” but more universal than the concepts that  designate a particular realm of beings. Such ontological concepts have been  called “principles,” “categories” or ultimate notions.* Tillich’s analysis of these  concepts is the very heart of his philosophy.’  These concepts, he holds, are strictly a priori. They are necessary condi-  tions for experience itself. They are present whenever something is experi-  enced, and hence constitute the very structure of experience. Tillich makes it  emphatically clear that this does not mean that the concepts are known prior  to experience; on the contrary, “they are products of a critical analysis of  experience.” 72  Taken seriously this Kantian language implies that the “being” to be ana-  lyzed is to be found only in the knower, and not, except derivatively, in the  known.3 But this is exactly what Tillich seems to be denying, for he says that  * Tillich, ST, I, 166.  t Tillich, ST, I, 165.  1.

Such ontological concepts have been called ‘principles,’ ‘categories,’ or  ‘ultimate notions.’ Tillich’s analysis of these concepts is the heart of his philosophy.”  2. Randall, “Ontology,” p. 151: “Such concepts, he holds, are strictly ‘apriod: they are present  whenever something is experienced, and determine the nature of experience itself. . . . This does  not mean that they can be known prior to experience: they are known rather through the critical  analysis of actual instances of experience.”  3. Randall, “Ontology,” p. 15 I : “Taken seriously, such language implies that the ‘being’ to be  analyzed is to be found only in the knower, and not, except derivatively, in the known; and this  is the essence of an idealistic epistemology.” 384 </p><div id="pagenum"><p>The Martin Luther King, Jr. Papers Project </p></div><div id="pagenum"><p>the structure of experience is discovered experience, by analysis. In other </p></div><p id="page">words Tillich’s language implies the Kantian critical philosophy, while his  analysis implies an epistemological realism.*  Tillich distinguishes four levels of ontological concepts: (1) the basic onto-  logical structure; (2) the “elements” constituting that structure; (3) the char-  acteristics or being which are the conditions of existence, or “existential be-  ing;’’ and (4) the categories of being and kn~wing.~ We shall discuss each of  these in order. 15 Apr  1955  i. The basic ontological structure  The basic starting point for ontology, in Tillich’s thought, is the self-world  correlation. The ontological question, “what is being?” presupposes an asking  “subject” and an object about which the question is asked; it presupposes the  subject-object structure of being. This in turn presupposes the self-world  structure as the basic articulation of being; being is man encountering the  world. This logically and experientially precedes all other struct~re.~  (1) Man, self and world  Man experiences himself as having a world to which he belongs, and it is  from the analysis of this polar relationship between man and the world that  the basic ontological structure is derived. Since man is estranged from nature,  and is unable to understand it in the way he understands man-he does not  know what men’s behavior means to men-the principles which constitute the  universe must be sought in man himself. Following Heidegger’s Sein und Zeit,  Tillich finds “being there” (Dasein)-the place where the structure of being is  manifest-given to man within himself. “Man is able to answer the ontological  * In criticizing Tillich at compatible with it.

Randall, “Ontology,” p. 152: “Tillich distinguishes four levels of ontological concepts:  (1) the basic ontological structure; (2) the ‘elements’ constituting that structure; (3) the character-  istics of being which are the conditions of existence, or ‘existential being’; and (4) the categories  of being and knowing.”  5. Randall, “Ontology,” p. 152: “The ontological question, ‘What is being?’ presupposes an  asking ‘subject’ and an ‘object’ about which the question is asked; it presupposes the subject-object  structure of being.

It means rather  that man is aware of the structures which make cognition possible. Being is  revealed not in objects, but in “the conditions necessary for knowing.” “The  truth of all ontological concepts is their power of expressing that which makes  the subject-object structure possible. They constitute this structure.” t6  Being a self means that man is both subject and object. He is a subject in  the sense that he is so separated from everything as to be able to look at it and  act upon it. He is object in the sense that he so belongs to the world, that he  is an intimate part of the process. But each factor determines the other. It is  wrong to assume that the environment wholly explains beha~ior.~  The mistake of all theories which explain the behavior of a being in terms of  environment alone is that they fail to explain the special character of the envi-  ronment in terms of the special character of the being which has such an envi-  ronment. Self and environment determine each other.$  Moreover, because man has an ego-self,§ he transcends every possible spatio-  temporal environment.

He writes, “selfhood or  self-centeredness must be  attributed in some mea-  sure to all living beings,  and in terms of analogy,  to all individual Gestalten  even in the inorganic realm. . . . Man is a fully  developed and completely  centered self. He ‘pos-  sesses’ himself in the form  of self-consciousness. He  has an ego-self.” (ST, I,  169, 170).  6. Randall, “Ontology,” p. 152: “Man experiences himself as having a world to which he be-  longs, and it is from the analysis of this polar relationship between man and the world that the  basic ontological structure is derived. Since man is estranged from nature, and is unable to un-  derstand it in the way he understands man-he does not know what the behavior of things means  to them, as he does know what men’s behavior means to men-the principles which constitute  the universe must be sought in man himself. Following Heidegger’s Sein und Zeit, Tillich finds  ‘being there’ (Duein)-the place where the structure of being is manifest-given to man within  himself. ‘Man is able to answer the ontological question himself because he experiences directly  and immediately the structure of being and its elements’ within himself. This does not mean that  it is easier to get a knowledge of man ‘sufficient for our purposes’ than a knowledge of nonhuman  objects. . . . It means that man is aware of ‘the structure that makes cognition possible,’ the  conditions of knowing. Being is revealed, not in objects, but in ‘the conditions necessary for  knowing.’ ‘The truth of all ontological concepts is their power of expressing that which makes  the subject-object structure possible. They constitute this structure’ (169).”  7. Roberts, “Tillich’s Doctrine of Man,” p. I 15: “Being a self means that man is both over  against the world, as a subject, and in the world, as an object. He is so separated from everything  as to be able to look at it and act upon it; he so belongs to the world that he is an episode in the  process. But each factor determines the other.

At other  times he holds that the  structure of being is  found by man in his en-  counters with the world.’*  This, Randall contends, is  a quite different ontology  from that of idealism it is something of an empirical  naturalism. And so Ran-  dall concludes that “it  would be clarifying to  have Tillich decide which  position he is really main-  taining-idealism; or an  experiential and func-  tional realism.”  $ Tillich, ST, I, 165.  11.

It is  only in the communion of personal encounter that persons can grow. Partici-  pation is essential for the individual. l9 “Without individualization nothing  would exist to be related. Without participation the category of relation would  have no basis in reality.”*20  It is clear from the foregoing that Tillich is not interested in slanting such  statements either in the idealistic or in the naturalistic direction. But it is es-  pecially important to recognize that he does not regard them as being derived  from empirical observation concerning contingent facts.

The reciprocal relationship between “personal” and ‘‘communal’’-for  example, one cannot become fully a self except in relation with other selves-  is a structural characteristic of being. In the polarity of individualization and  participation Tillich finds a solution to the endless problem of nominalism  and realism.21 Individuals are real, but they participate in the universal struc-  ture, which, however, is not some sort of second reality lying behind empirical  reality. t  (2) Dynamics and form  Being something means having a form. Whatever loses its form loses its  being. But every form forms something, and this something Tillich calls  “dynamics.” The concept of dynamics is a very complex one with many con-  notations. Its complexity is due to the fact that it cannot be thought of as  something that is; and yet it cannot be thought of as something that is not.  * Tillich, ST, I, 177.  t Tillich, ST, I, 178.  ig.

Delib-  eration points to an act of weighing motives. The person doing the weighing  is always above the motives that are weighed.33 “To say that the stronger mo-  tive always prevails is an empty tautology, since the test by which a motive is  proved stronger is simply that it prevails.” * The self-centered person does the  weighting and then reacts with his whole self. This reaction is called decision.  Etymologically the word “decision” like the word “incision” involves the image  of cutting. In this context decision means cutting off possibilities. The person  who does the cutting is always beyond what he cuts Responsibility is the  obligation that every individual has to give an answer for the decision he has  made. Hence the self is responsible in so far as its acts are determined, not by  something external or by some dissociated segment or function, but by the  centered totality of the person’s being.  Freedom, as thus defined, goes hand and hand with destiny.35 Destiny is the  basis of freedom and freedom participates in destiny.? The concrete self out  of which decisions arise must not be thought of merely as a center of self-  consciousness.

Being and finitude  The third level of ontological concepts expresses the characteristics of being  which are conditions of existence, and the difference between “existential be-  ing” and “essential being.” This duality of essential and existential being is  found both in experience and in analysis.39  There is no ontology which can disregard these two aspects, whether they are  hypostasized into two realms (Plato), or combined in the polar relation of poten-  tiality and actuality (Aristotle), or contrasted with each other (Schelling 11, Kier-  kegaard, Heidegger), or derived from each other, either existence from essence  (Spinoza, Hegel), or essence from existence (Dewey, Sartre).t40  Freedom as such is not the basis of existence, but rather freedom is unity with  finitude. “Finite freedom is the turning point from being to existence.”$ Fi-  nitude is hence the center of Tillich’s analysis, for it is the finitude of existent  being which drives men to the question of God.41  * Tillich, ST, I, 185.  t Tillich, ST, I, 165.  $ Tillich, ST, I, 165.  strivings, moral and spiritual character, communal relations, past experiences (both remembered  and forgotten), and the total impact of the environment.

Those philosophers who emphasize  the negative element  point to the movement of time from a past that is no more toward a future that  is not yet through a present which is nothing more than the moving boundary  line between past and present.*  Those who emphasize the positive element in time “have pointed to the cre-  ative character of the temporal process, to its directness and irreversibility, to  the new produced within it.”?.

It also means a social “space”-a vocation, a sphere of  influence, a group, a historical period, a place in rememberance and anticipa-  tion, a place within a structure of values and meanings.?  Not to have a place is not to be. Thus the continual striving for spatiality is an  ontological necessity.66  On the negative side, however, it must be observed that no place is defi-  nitely one’s “No finite being can rely on space, for not only must it face  losing this or that space because it is a ‘pilgrim on earth,’ but eventually it must  face losing every place it has had or might have had.”$ This awareness of  * Tillich, ST, I, 194.

It accepts its ontological insecurity and reaches a security in this  acceptance.”  (3) Causality  The affirmative interpretation of causality points to the power from which  things proceed, the power which can produce and maintain realities despite  the resistance of nonbeing. The negative interpretation notes, however, that  finite things do not possess their own power of coming into being. They are  contingent: as Heidegger says, they have been “thrown” into being.70  The question, “Where from?” is universal. Children as well as philosophers ask  it. But it cannot be answered, for every answer, every statement, about the cause  of something is open to the same question in infinite regression. It cannot be  stopped even by a god who is supposed to be the answer to the entire series. For  this god must ask himself, “Where have I come from?”?  So it turns out that causality and contingent being are the same thing.’l The  anxiety in which man is aware of this situation is anxiety about his lack of  aseity (the self-sufficiency possessed by God alone). Tillich’s discussion of cau-  sality supports the thesis that human existence is not necessitated. If the latter  were the case, man would be incapable of anxiety, and he could not ask ques-  tions based upon awareness of the fact that he “might not” be.

The answer to this question is furnished by revelation and by  the existential decision which enters into faith in  2. God as being itself  Tillich defines God in diverse ways. God is spoken of as “the name of this  infinite and inexhaustible depth and ground of all being,”” as the name of the  ground of history,”t as “the answer to the question implied in being,”$ as “the  power of being in which every-being participates,”$ as “the power in every-  thing that has power,”II as “the name for that which concerns us ultimately,”#  and as “being itself.”**77 Out of all of these definitions, it seems that Tillich’s  most persistent definition of God is “being-itself,” esse ipsum. Let us therefore  turn to a discussion of Tillich’s meaning of being-itself.  i. God’s transcendence of finite being  In affirming that God is being-itself, Tillich is denying that God is a being  besides other beings. He is also denying that God is a “highest being” in the  sense of the “most perfect” and “most powerful” being. If God were a being  He would be subject to the categories of finitude, especially to the categories  of space and substance. Therefore if such confusions are to be avoided, says  Tillich, God must be understood as being-itself or as the ground of being.78  * Tillich, SOF, 57. 11. ** Tillich, ST, I, 189,  $ Tillich, ST, I, 163. 11.

The answer to this question is furnished by revelation and by the existential decision which enters  into faith in God.”  77. Boozer, “Place of Reason,” p. 151: “Though [Tillich] speaks of God in such diverse ways  as ‘the answer to the question implied in being,’ ‘the name of this infinite and inexhaustible depth  and ground of all being,’ as ‘the name of the ground of history,’ ‘the basis and abyss of all meaning  which surpasses all that is conceivable,’ ‘the power of being in which every being participates,’ ‘the  power in everything that has power,’ ‘the name for that which concerns man ultimately,’ as ‘being  itself,’ and as ‘Lord’ and ‘Father,’ he is jealous to safeguard the non-existential status of God.”  King’s footnotes are similar to Boozer’s. In another section of his dissertation Boozer also wrote  about God as being-itself (p. 256) and included a footnote listing the additional page numbers  from Systematic Theology and The Protestant Era that King cites here.  78. Tillich, Systematic Theology, p. 235: “If God is a being, he is subject to the categories of  finitude, especially to space and substance. Even if he is called the ‘highest being’ in the sense of 404 </p><div id="pagenum"><p>The Martin Luther King, Jr. Papers Project </p></div><div id="pagenum"><p>Tillich often speaks as though “absolute,” “unconditional,” “infinite,” “eter- </p></div><p id="page">nal” were synonyms for “being-itself”; but he insists that being-itself, or God,  is “beyond finitude and infinity,” “relative” and “absolute,” * “temporal” and  “eternal,” and even “spatial” and “spaceless.”  In saying that God is being-itself Tillich intends to convey the idea of power  of being. God is the power of being in everything and above everything.$  Tillich is convinced that any theology which does not dare to identify God  and the power of being as the first step in its doctrine of God relapses into  monarchic monotheism.80  The traditional category of omnipotence is included in the concept of God  as being-itself. God as power of being resists and conquers nonbeing.8 In the  Christian belief of an “almighty God,” there is the assurance of the inexhaust-  ible power of being to resist nonbeing. This is why God warrants man’s ulti-  mate concern. The omnipotence of God does not mean that God has the  power to do anything he wishes.81 Nor does it mean omni-activity in terms of  physical causality. Such conceptions of omnipotence, asserts Tillich, are ab-  surd and irreligious. Tillich uses the symbol of omnipotence to express the  religious experience “that no structure in reality and no event in nature and  history has the power of preventing us from communion with the infinite and  inexhaustible ground of meaning and being.”II This idea of omnipotence is  expressed in the Pauline assertion that neither natural nor political powers,  neither heavenly nor earthly forces can separate us from the love of God.82 15 Apr  1955  * Tillich, ST, I, 144. sonal monism of power.  t Tillich, ST, I, 138. 0 Tillich, ST, I, 272.  $ Tillich, ST, I, 236.

Tillich, Systematic Theology, p. 236: “He is the power of being in everything and above  everything, the infinite power of being.

Boozer, “Place of Reason,” p. 189: “The traditional category of omnipotence is included  in the concept of God as being-itself. God as power of being resists and conquers non-being. In  the Christian belief in an ‘almighty God,’ Tillich sees a confidence in the inexhaustible power of  being to resist nonbeing. Only the ‘almighty’ God can warrant man’s ultimate concern. . . . The  omnipotence of God does not mean that God is able to do whatever he wishes.”  82. Paul Tillich, “The Idea of the Personal God,” Union Review 2 (1940): 9: “Or what ‘omnipo-  tence’ means must be found in the words Paul (Rom. 8) speaks to the few Christians in the slums 405 </p><div id="pagenum"><p>The Martin Luther King, Jr. Papers Project </p></div><div id="pagenum"><p>15 Apr </p></div><p id="page">1955 All of this leads Tillich to the conclusion that omnipotence means “the power  of being which resists nonbeing in all its expressions.”*  In this conception of God as being-itself or power of being, Tillich seeks to  solve the problems of the immanence and the transcendence of God. God is  transcendent in the sense that he, as the power of being, transcends every  being and also the totality of beings-the world. God is beyond finitude and  infinity; otherwise he would be conditioned by something other than him-  self.83 Tillich makes it palpably clear that “being itself infinitely transcends  every finite being. There is no proportion or gradation between the finite and  the infinite. There is an absolute break, an infinite ‘jump’.”?  On the other hand God’s immanence is expressed in the fact that every-  thing finite participates in being itself and in infinity. If this were not the case  everything finite would be swallowed by nonbeing, or it never would have  emerged out of nonbeing.SE4  So we can see that all beings have a double relation to being-itself. This  double relation that all beings have to being-itself gives being-itself a double  character is ti^.^^ Being-itself is both creative and abysmal. Its creative character  is found in the fact that all beings participate in the infinite power of being.  Its abysmal character is found in the fact that all beings are infinitely tran-  scended by their creative ground.§  ii. God’s transcendence of the contrast  of essential and existential being  As being-itself God is beyond the contrast of essential and existential being.  The transition of being into existence which involves the possibility that being  will contradict and lose itself, is excluded from being-itself.[[ Logically being-  itself is prior to the split which characterizes finite being.86  * Tillich, ST, I, 273. $ Tillich, ST, I, 237. viz., the christological  t Tillich, ST, I, 237.

This is what pantheism means.”?  On the other hand, it is a grave error to speak of God as exi~ting.~’ Tillich  affirms that the Scholastics were right in their claim that in God there is no  difference between essence and existence. But they perverted this whole truth  by proceeding to talk of the existence of God and even attempting to prove  such existence.88 “It is as atheistic to affirm the existence of God,” asserts Til-  lich, “as it is to deny it. God is being-itself, not a being.”$ Again Tillich writes:  It would be a great victory for Christian apologetics if the words “God” and  “existence” were very definitely separated except in the paradox of God becom-  ing manifest under the conditions of existence, that is in the Christological para-  dox. God does not exist. He is being-itself, beyond essence and existence. There-  fore, to argue that God exists is to deny him.§  Tillich is convinced that the usual discussions of the existence of God com-  pletely miss the essential nature of God. Such discussions start out with the  assumption that God is something or someone.89 But God is not a being, not  even the most powerful or the most perfect being. The objectification or the  “thingification” (to use J. L. Adams’ term) of God is blasphemy.g0 Whenever  God is made an object besides other objects, the existence of which is a matter  * Tillich, ST, I, 205.  t Tillich, ST, I, 236.  $ Tillich, ST, I, 237.

This transition is excluded from being-  itself (except in terms of the christological paradox), for being-itself does not participate in  nonbeing. . . .

The invalidity of all arguments for  the existence of God  Since God does not exist, Tillich finds the various arguments for the exis-  tence of God both futile and invalid. Theologians and philosophers, contends  Tillich, should have said something about the ontological implications of fi-  nitude rather than present elaborate arguments for the existence of God. The  analysis of finitude shows that finitude witnesses to something beyond the  finite.gz “The arguments for the existence of God neither are arguments nor  are they proof of the existence of God. They are expressions of the question  of God which is implied in human finitude.”? It is in this sense that Tillich  seeks to interpret the traditional arguments for the existence of God.  The so-called ontological argument points to the ontological structure of  finitude.g5 The marks of man’s existence are separation, self-contradiction and  estrangement.

What Tillich is really seeking to say  is that God is presupposed in the question of God. Even to deny God is to  affirm him. Says Tillich:  Die Frage nach der Wahrheit der Religion ist beantwortet durch die metalogisch  Erfassung des Wesens der Religion als Richtung auf den unbedingten Sinn. Es  ist sinnlos, ausserdem zu fragen, ob das Unbedingte “ist,” ob also der religiose  Akt sich auf Wirkliches richtet und insofern wahr ist oder nicht.tloO  Tillich, like Augustine, is convinced that God neither needs nor can receive  “proof.” He is that ultimate-Tillich’s term is das Unbedingte-which is a  certain quality of the world man encounters and which analysis reveals as  “presupposed” in all his encountering. Whereas Augustine’s Platonism led  him to an intellectual emphasis on the truth or Logos implied in all knowl-  edge, Tillich has expanded it to the “power of being” implied in all men’s  varied participation in the world in which they are grasped by an ultimate  concern.  God as the “power of being,” as Seinsmachiakeit, is the source of all power.  Thus the power of thought is derived from the Ground of power, yet that  Ground is not accessible to thought.I0’  So far as one has power he cannot escape God. To doubt, to feel, to think,  to know, indeed to exist affirms God. For God as “power of being” is that  power by which one doubts, feels, thinks, knows, exists.  Being itself, as present in the ontological awareness, is power of Being but not  the most powerful being: it is neither ens realissimum nor ens singularissimum.  It is the power in everything that has power, be it a universal or an individual, a  thing or an experience.$lo2  * Tillich, ST, I, 210. $ Tillich, Art. (1946)~.  t Tillich, Art.

Therefore,  if anything beyond this bare assertion is said about God, it no longer is a direct  and proper statement. It is indirect and points to something beyond itself.  The statement that God is being-itself is the only literal statement that can be  made concerning God. It does not point beyond itself. It means what it says  directly and properly. God is not God if he is not being-itself.  However after this has been said, nothing else can be said about God which  is not  Glaube ist Richtung auf das Unbedingte als solchen Gegenstand sein, sondern  nur das Symbol, in dem das Unbedingte anschaut und gewallt wird.

Tillich, Systematic Theology, pp. 238-239: “The statement that God is being-itself is a  nonsymbolic statement. It does not point beyond itself. It means what it says directly and  properly. . . . However, after this has been said, nothing else can be said about God as God which  is not symbolic.

Therefore, if anything  beyond this hare assertion is said about God, it no longer is a direct and proper statement, no  longer a concept. It is indirect, and it points to something beyond itself.”  104. Boozer also quoted the previous two passages from Tillich. He introduced them with the  sentence, “God as ground and abyss cannot be an object of thought or language” (“Place of  Reason,” p. 160). 411 </p><div id="pagenum"><p>The Martin Luther King, Jr. Papers Project </p></div><div id="pagenum"><p>15 Apr </p></div><p id="page">1955 symbol is its innate power. A sign is impotent in itself. Because the sign has  no inner power, it does not arise from necessity. It is interchangeable at will.  The symbol, however, does possess a necessary character. It cannot be ex-  changed.* IO5  But the question arises, can a segment of finite reality become the basis for  an assertion about that which is infinite? Tillich’s answer is that it can, because  that which is infinite is being-itself, and because everything participates in  being-itself.  Religious symbols use a finite reality in order to express our relation to the infi-  nite. But the finite reality they use is not an arbitrary means for an end, some-  thing strange to it; it participates in the power of the ultimate for which it  stands.?  This leads Tillich to affirm that religious symbols are doubled-edged. They  express not only what is symbolized but also that through which it is symbol-  ized.Io6 They are directed toward the infinite which they symbolize and to-  ward the finite through which they symbolize it. They open the finite and the  human for the infinite and divine, and the infinite and divine for the finite  and human. The symbol “Father,” for instance, when applied to God, brings  God down to the human relationship of father and child. But at the same  time it lifts the human relationship up to its theonomous sacramental depth.  If God is called king, something is said not only about God but also about the  sacredness of kinghood. If the work of God is spoken of as “making whole”  or “healing,” something is said not only about God but about the holiness of  all healing. Any segment of reality that is used as a symbol for God is at that  moment elevated to the realm of the sacred. It becomes theonomous.flo7  * Tillich, Art.

Paul Tillich, “The Religious Symbol,” Journal of Liberal Relipon 2 (1940): 13-14: “The  third characteristic of the symbol is its innate power. This implies that the symbol has a power  inherent within it that distinguishes it from the mere sign which is impotent in itself. This char-  acteristic is decisive for the distinction between a sign and a symbol. The sign is interchangeable  at will. It does not arise from necessity, for it has no inner power. The symbol, however, does  possess a necessary character. It cannot be exchanged.”  106. Tillich, Protestant Era, p. 61: “A religious symbol is double edged.

But at the same time this human relationship is consecrated into a pattern of the divine-human  relationship.

In the first case,  theology can point out the religious and theological errors embedded in cer-  tain symbols; in the second case, theology can become prophecy, contributing  to a change in the revelatory situation.*lo8  Tillich revolts vehemently against the idea that the symbol is nonreal. He  contends that this erroneous idea stems partly from the confusion between  sign and symbol, and partly from the identification of reality with empirical  reality. He sees an even greater source of the confusion stemming from the  tendency of some theological movements, such as Protestant Hegelianism and  Catholic modernism, to interpret religious language symbolically in order to  dissolve its realistic meaning and to weaken its seriousness, its power, and its  spiritual impact. Such a view fails to see that the intention of most theologians  who have spoken of God in symbolic terms has been to give to God more  reality and power than a nonsymbolic and therefore easily superstitious inter-  pretation could give them.? In this sense, asserts Tillich, symbolic interpreta-  tion is proper and necessary.1°9 15 Apr  1955  3.

He is not any particular being  beside other beings, not even the highest being.$ This complete lack of par-  ticularity in God is expressed in Tillich’s idea of God as das Unbedingte, the  Unconditioned or the Unconditional.§ Since Tillich has written at length  about the unconditioned the idea may profitably be considered.L1o  Tillich’s thought concerning the Unconditioned is not at all clearly stated.  At times Tillich speaks of the unconditional as a quality; at other times he  speaks as if the unconditioned were being-itself, i.e. God.”’  In a very interesting lecture on “Kairos,” Tillich speaks of the unconditional  as a quality.112  In every symbol of the divine an unconditional claim is expressed, most power-  fully in the command: “Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy soul and  with all thy mind.” No partial, restricted, conditioned love of God is admitted.  The term “unconditioned” or the adjective made into the substantive, “the un-  conditional,” is an abstraction from such sayings which abound in the Bible and  in great religious literature. The unconditional is a quality, not a being. It char-  acterizes that which is our ultimate and, consequently unconditional concern,  whether we call it “God” or “Being as such,” or the “God as such” or the “true as  such,” or whether we give it any other name. It would be a complete mistake to  understand the unconditional as a being the existence of which can be discussed.  He who speaks of the “existence of the unconditional” has thoroughly misun-  derstood the meaning of the term. Unconditional is a quality which we experi-  * Tillich, IOH, 222; PE, Tillich’s thought, says that 300).

Boozer, “Place of Reason,” pp. 154- 155: “A persistent idea in Tillich’s writing about God  is that God is not an object for us as subjects. God is not any particular meaning to be placed  ~ beside other meanings, not even the highest meaning. God is not any particular value beside  other values, not even the highest value. God is not any particular being beside other beings, not  even the highest being. The complete lack of particularity in God led Dr. Harkness to write: ‘The  one element in our knowledge of God which is literal fact, and not symbol, is God’s character as  the Unconditioned.’ As Tillich has written at length about the unconditioned, though without  consistent clarity, the idea may profitably be considered.” The quotation is from Georgia Hark-  ness, “The Abyss and the Given,” Christendom 3 (1938): 512.  111.

But even here the issue is clouded when Tillich  says that the unconditional “characterizes that which is our ultimate and,  consequently, unconditional concern, whether we call it ‘God’ or ‘Being as  such.”’ 114 This seems to contradict the insistence in the immediately preced-  ing passage that the unconditional is a quality.  There are passages in which Tillich seems to identify the unconditional with  being-itself. For instance, Tillich writes:  The unconditional meaning . . . toward which every act of meaning is directed  is implicit faith, and which supports the whole, which protects it from a plunge  into a nothingness void of meaning, itself has two aspects: it bears the meaning  of each single meaning as well as the meaning of the whole. That is, it is the basis  of meaning.? 115  Tillich goes on in the same book to speak of the unconditional simultaneously  as basis of meaning and abyss of meaning.S1I6 Both of these passages seem to  set forth the unconditional as identical with being-itself. Again Tillich writes:  “But the really real is not reached until the unconditional ground of every-  thing real, or the unconditioned power in every power of being, is reached.”  Here again, unconditional seems to refer to the ground of being or being-  itself. Other passages could be added to these to indicate Tillich’s tendency to  speak of the unconditional as being-itself, in spite of his insistence that the  unconditional is a quality of being-itself. However despite these ambiguities  it seems to be consistent with Tillich’s intention to say that the unconditional  is a quality of being-itself; which quality man experiences in the encounter  * Tillich, PE, 32n.

Boozer, “Place of Reason,” p. 158: “Again Tillich writes: ‘But the really real is not  reached until the unconditional ground of everything real, or the unconditioned power in every  power of being, is reached.’ Here again, unconditional refers to the ground of being or being-  itself. Other passages could be added to these to indicate that in spite of Tillich’s assertion that  the unconditional is a quality and not a being.” The quotation is from Paul Tillich, The Protestant  Era, trans.

L. Adams also interprets Tillich’s idea of the uncondi-  tional as a quality of being-itself. Of Tillich’s unconditional he writes:  Hence, as the depth or the infinity of things, it is both the ground and abyss of  being. It is that quality in being and truth, in goodness and beauty, that elicits  man’s ultimate concern; thus it is the absolute quality of all being and meaning  and value, the power and vitality of the real as it fulfills itself in meaningful  creativity.* 119  In his idea of God as the unconditional, Tillich is attempting to impress the  point that God is not an object which we as subjects perceive or think about.’20  He insists that the term unconditional is not to be confused with the Absolute  of German idealism, with the eternal essence of Platonism, with the superes-  sential One of mysticism, with the Supreme Being of rational deduction, or  with the “Wholly Other” of Barthian theology.? In all these terms that which  should be thought of as Being itself tends to be looked upon as a particular  being about whose existence there might be an argument. One can argue  neither for nor against the existence of the unconditional. To argue about it  is to presuppose it, for the very argument presupposes some unconditional  demand and reality. The unconditional is not a section of reality; it is not an  object among objects, not even the highest “object.” The unconditional tran-  scends the distinction between subject and object. The unconditional is not a  “Neither ‘the Unconditioned’ nor ‘something unconditioned,’ is meant  as a being, not even the highest being, not even God. God is unconditional,  that makes him God: but the ‘unconditional’ is not God.”$ To draw God down  into the world of objects and beings is to indulge in the basest idolatry. And  atheism is justified when it protests against the existence of a being.  * Adams, Art. (1948), 300, 301. $ Tillich, Art. (1946)2, 11.  Italics mine.  t Tillich, Art. (1946), 2, io.  i 18.

As  we shall see later in the discussion, this prius of separation is not a person. It  is power, power of being. Tillich is greatly influenced by existential philoso-  phy at this point. He interprets existential philosophy as an attempt to find a  level which precedes the contrast between subject and object. “It aims to cut  under the ‘subject-object distinction’ and to reach that stratum of Being which  Jaspers, for instance, calls the ‘Ursprung’ or Source,” 7 122  Tillich’s existential leaning leads him to affirm that one has awareness of the  unconditional. The term “awareness” is used because it is a neutral term and  may be distinguished from knowledge and experience. The term “experi-  ence” should not be used because it ordinarily describes the observed pres-  ence of one reality to another reality, and because the unconditioned is not a  matter of experiential observation. The term “knowledge” presupposes the  separation of subject and object, and implies a discrete theoretical act, which  is just the opposite of awareness of the unconditioned.lZ3 Schleiermacher rec-  ognized the inappropriateness of “knowledge” as the basis of religious con-  sciousness, but he conditioned the awareness by assigning it to “feeling.” The  awareness of the unconditional involves the whole being. “Man, not his cog-  nitive function alone, is aware of the Unconditioned.”$ It is therefore possible  to call this awareness existential in the sense that man as a whole participates  in the cognitive 15 Apr  1955  * Tillich, Art.

To argue about it is to presuppose  it, for the very argument must itself presuppose some unconditional demand and reality. . . . The  unconditional is not a section of reality; it is not a thing or an ‘existing’ entity; it is not an object  among objects, not even the highest ‘object.’ . . . The unconditional transcends the distinction  between subject and object. . . . The unconditional is not u being.”  122. Boozer, “Place of Reason,” pp. 102- 104: “Believing that God ‘is no object for us as sub-  jects,’ Tillich moves behind the separation to the prius of the separation into subject and object,  to that.which precedes this division. . . . But Tillich does not think of God as a person. . . . The  prius of separation, then, is power, power of being. Tillich follows existential philosophy at this  point. For he interprets existential philosophy as an attempt to find a level which precedes the  contrast between subject and object. ‘It aims to cut under the “subject-object distinction” and to  reach that stratum of Being which Jaspers, for instance, calls the “Ursprung” or “Source.””’  I 23. Paul Tillich, “The Two Types of Philosophy of Religion,” Union Seminary Quurterly Review  I, no. 4 (May 1946): io: “Neither should the word ‘experience’ be used, because it ordinarily  describes the observed presence of one reality to another reality, and because the Unconditioned  is not a matter of experiential observation. ‘Knowledge’ finally presupposes the separation of  subject and object, and implies an isolated theoretical act, which is just the opposite of awareness  of the Unconditioned.”  124. Tillich, “Two Types of Philosophy,” p. io: “It would, therefore, be possible to call this  awareness ‘existential’ in the sense in which the Existential philosophy has used the word, namely  the participation of man as a whole in the cognitive act.” 4l7 </p><div id="pagenum"><p>The Martin Luther King, Jr. Papers Project </p></div><div id="pagenum"><p>15 Apr </p></div><p id="page">1955 From the above we can see that there is a close relationship between the  unconditional and man’s ultimate concern. This passage, in which Tillich de-  fines “ultimate concern,” clearly expresses the similarity:  Ultimate concern is the abstract translation of the great commandment: “The  Lord, our God, the Lord is one; and you shall love the Lord your God with all  your heart, and with all your soul and with all your mind, and with all your  strength.” The religious concern is ultimate; it excludes all other concerns from  ultimate significance; it makes them preliminary. The ultimate concern is uncon-  ditional, independent of any conditions of character, desire, or circumstance.  The unconditional concern is total: no part of ourselves or of our world is ex-  cluded from it; there is no “place” to flee from it. The total concern is infinite:  no moment of relaxation and rest is possible in the face of a religious concern  which is ultimate, unconditional, total, and infinite.*  In an even clearer analysis of the nature of the ultimate concern, Tillich  says: “Our ultimate concern is that which determines our being or not-  being.”? That which does not have the power of threatening or saving our  being$ cannot be of ultimate concern for us. Man is ultimately concerned  about his being and meaning, about that which conditions his being beyond  all the conditions in him and around him, about that which determines his  ultimate destiny beyond all preliminary necessities and accidents.§ lP6  So in Tillich’s usage the unconditional is a philosophical symbol for the  ultimate concern of man. God is the name for that which concerns man un-  conditionally or ultimately.  4. God as ground and abyss of power  and meaning  We have seen that, according to Tillich, all beings have a double relation to  being-itself.

But the term ‘being’ means the whole of human reality,  the structure, the meaning, and the aim of existence.”  126. Tillich, Systematic Theology, p. 14: “Nothing can be of ultimate concern for us which does  not have the power of threatening and saving our being. . . .

In this definition Tillich is seeking to establish two polar  concepts ontologically. “The divine life,” says Tillich, “is the dynamic unity of  depth and form.”$’28 15 Apr  1955  In a passage in his Interpretation of History, Tillich writes:  The unconditional meaning . . . is the basis of meaning. Yet it is never to be  grasped as such in any one act of meaning. It is transcendent in regard to every  individual meaning. We can therefore speak of the unconditional simultaneously  as basis of meaning and abyss of meaning (Sinngrund und abgrund). We call this  object of the silent belief in the ultimate meaninglessness, this basis and abyss  of all meaning which surpasses all that is conceivable, God. . . . Unconditional  meaning has the quality of inexhaustibility. . . . The concept “meaning” is sup-  posed to express all aspects of the human mind and therefore is just as valid in  application to the practical as to the theoretical. The basis of meaning is just as  much the basis of personality and community as of being and significance; and  it is simultaneously the abyss of all. . . . The unconditioned appears as that which  does not admit any conditioned fulfillment of its commandments, as that which  is able to destroy every personality and community which tries to escape the  unconditioned demand. We miss the quality of the unconditioned meaning, of  being basis and abyss, if we interpret it either from an intellectual point of view  or from a moral point of view alone. Only in the duality of both does the uncon-  ditioned meaning manifest itself.§’zy  This rather lengthy passage sets forth the two ideas that God is basis (ground)  of being and meaning, and that God is the depth (abyss) of being and mean-  ing. Here we see correlation lifted to the very nature of God. Moreover, we  see that the tensions in existence between form and formlessness find their  basis in the nature of In order to get a clearer conception of these two  aspects of the divine life, we shall discuss them separately.  * Tillich, ST, I, 237. $ Tillich, ST, I, 156.  t Tillich, ST, I, 21, 250; § Tillich, IOH, 222, 223,  IOH, 222. 224.  127.

God as ground  Tillich has a twofold purpose for emphasizing God as the ground of all  being and reality. On the one hand, the concept establishes the dependence  of “being” upon the source of being, all meaning upon the source of meaning.  This emphasis saves man from the arrogance of thinking he is an autonomous  being with no dependence on God, the source of being. On the other hand,  the concept of ground is a basis of continuity between God and the world, of  man and nature. This is the creativity of  In the idea of ground, Tillich seems to be setting forth the idea of the  rationality of God. Concerning the ground, Tillich writes:  The ground is not only an abyss in which every form disappears; it also is the  source from which every form emerges. The ground of being has the character  of self-manifestation; it has @ character. This is not something added to the  divine life; it is the divine life itself. In spite of its abysmal character the ground  of being is “logical”; it includes its own m.*lsz  In this passage Tillich seems to be saying that the ground of being has a  logos character. Tillich’s usual assertion is that God is ground of being and  meaning. But here he says that ground has a - character. In other words  the ground is logical and rational. Here it seems that the ground takes on  character and meaning, and God becomes more than the amorphous “being-  itself” which is the ground of everything, without itself being anything. The  nature of God as ground implies the rationality of  But the issue is not totally clear. As one continues to read Tillich he discov-  ers that it is difficult to determine whether Tillich’s God is logos or the ground  of W. In the paragraph following the difficulty is set forth clearly:  * Tillich, ST, I, 157, 158.  ing. . . . The tensions in existence between form and the formless, good and evil, the sacred and  the secular, find their basis in the nature of God.”  13 1. Boozer, “Place of Reason,” p. 17 1 : “In emphasizing God as the ground of all being and  meaning, Tillich wishes to establish the dependence of all ‘beings’ upon the source of being, all  meanings upon the source of meaning. . . . But the major idea which Tillich strives to express in  the concept of ‘Ground’ is a basis of continuity between God and the world of man and nature.  This is the creativity of God.”  132. Boozer quoted this passage from Tillich (“Place of Reason,” p. 172).  133. Boozer, “Place of Reason,” p. 174: “Tillich’s basic and usual assertion is that God is the  ground of being and meaning. But here he says that the ground has a character, that the  ground is therefore logical and rational. . . . In this case the ground itself takes on character and  meaning, and it supersedes the amorphous ‘being itself’ which is the ground of everything that  is, without itself being anything.

This is one of the difficulties that the  interpreter of Tillich continually confronts. Is God a ground somehow behind  every form and structure or is he a ground which has a form?’35  It seems that Tillich comes to realize the difficulties of his indeterminant  “being itself” which is the ground of everything, without itself being anything.  And so he emerges to the point of emphasizing God as not only the ground  of structure, but as structure; not only as the ground of reason, but as rea-  God is no longer merely that from which reason proceeds, but he him-  self is rational.

God is not only the source from which every form  emerges, but also the abyss in which every form disappears.tI3’ If one says  that God is rational he must also say that God is abysmal.$  ii. God as abyss  In the concept of the abyss Tillich is endeavoring to protect the inexhaust-  ibility of God. God as ground forms creation.

Bright-  man’s “Given” in God.  The abyss for Tillich is in-  exhaustible power, infinite  ~ita1ity.l~~ The “Given” of  Brightman consists of the  eternal uncreated laws of  reason, including logic,  mathematical relations,  and Platonic Ideas, and  also of equally eternal un-  created nonrational as-  pects, “which exhibit all  the ultimate qualities of  sense objects, disorderly impulses and desires, such  experiences as pain and  suffering, the forms of  space and time, and what-  ever in God is the source  of surd evil.” (POR,  337).143 For Brightman  God not only eternally  finds “the Given” in his  experience, but he also  eternally controls it. Til-  lich asserts that God as  form is always in control  of the abyss so far as  God’s relation with exis-  tential man is concerned.  Yet he nevertheless em- phasizes the abyss as the  primary essence of God.  The abyss is “that which  makes God God” (ST, I,  250). For Brightman  God’s essence is meaning,  will, value and rationality.  God’s reason controls the  “given” at every  There is a very interesting  comparison of Bright-  man’s “Given” with Til-  lich’s “abyss” written by  Georgia Harkness (Hark-  ness, Art.

Brightman, Philosophy of Religzon, p. 337: “The Given consists of the eternal, uncreated  laws of reason including logic, mathematical relations, and Platonic ideas, and also of equally  eternal and uncreated processes of nonrational consciousness which exhibit all the ultimate quali-  ties of sense objects . . .” The rest of the quotation from Brightman is accurate.  144. Boozer, “Place of Reason,” pp. 193- 194: “So far as God’s revealing activity is concerned,  that is God’s relation with existential man, God as form is always in control of the abyss. As there  are similarities between Tillich’s ‘abyss’ and E. S. Brightman’s ‘given’ in God, there is also a simi-  larity between Tillich’s idea that God’s form controls his power and Brightman’s idea that God’s  reason controls the given. . . . For Brightman God in his essence is meaning, will, purpose, value  and rationality.”  145. Boozer, “Place of Reason,” p. 192: “Is the abyss of being-itself an abyss of inexhaustible  meaning (the richness of God’s personality) with which man’s ‘meanings’ are analogous?

It can mean “nothing  at all,” i.e. the absolute negation of being (ouk on), or it can mean the relative  negation of being (me on). If it means me on, it cannot be the origin of the  creature. The term ex nihilo, nevertheless says something fundamentally im-  portant about the creature, namely, that it must take over “the heritage of  nonbeing.” $ Creatureliness implies both the heritage of nonbeing and the  heritage of being.158 Its heritage of being stems from its participation in being-  itself, in the creative ground of being.§  God’s originating creativity is also expressed in the Nicene Creed which  states that God is creator of “everything visible and invisible.” Like the for-  mula just discussed, this phrase also has a protective function. It is directed  against the Platonic view that the Creator-God is dependent on the eternal  essences or ideas. The essences are not independent of God, standing in some  transcendent realm as models for his creative activity. They are, as Neo-  Platonism taught, in the divine mind. They are themselves dependent on  God’s eternal creativity.159 “The essential powers of being,” affirms Tillich,  * Tillich, I, 252.  7 Tillich, I, 252.  j: Tillich, ST, I, 254.  § Tillich, ST, I, 254.  157. Tillich, Systematic Theology, p. 253: “The classical Christian doctrine of creation uses the  phrase creatio ex nihilo. . . . Their obvious meaning is a critical negation. God finds nothing ‘given’  to him which influences him in his creativity or which resists his creative telos. The doctrine of  creatio ex nihilo is Christianity’s protection against any type of ultimate dualism. . . . This negative  meaning of creatio ex nihilo is clear and decisive for every Christian experience and assertion.”  158. Tillich, Systematic Theology, p. 253: “The question arises, however, whether the term ex  nihilo points to more than the rejection of dualism. The word ex seems to refer to the origin of  the creature. ‘Nothing’ is what (or where) it comes from. Now ‘nothing’ can mean two things. It  can mean the absolute negation of being (ouk on), or it can mean the relative negation of being  (me on). . . . If ex nihilo meant the absolute negation of being, it could not be the origin of the  creature. Nevertheless, the term ex nihilo says something fundamentally important about the crea-  ture, namely, that it must take over what might be called ‘the heritage of nonbeing.’ . . . [Creature-  liness] includes both the heritage of nonbeing (anxiety) and the heritage of being (courage).”  159.

But it also means that “man  has left the ground in order to ‘stand upon’ himself, to actualize what he  essentially is in order to be finite freedom.”? This is the point at which cre-  ation and the fall join.$ Tillich admits that this is the most difficult and the  most dialectical point in the doctrine of creation. It says that fully developed  creatureliness is fallen creatureliness. Man is not only “inside” the divine life,  but also “outside” it. Being outside the divine life means to stand in actualized  freedom, in an existence which is no longer united with essence. Seen from  one side, this is creation. Seen from the other side, this is the fall.QLG1 Creation  is fulfilled in the creaturely self-realization which simultaneously is freedom  and destiny.[lL6*  From this background we gain the meaning of what is called “human crea-  tivity.” Man is creative in the sense of “bringing the new into being.” But this  human creativity differs sharply from God’s creativity which consists of “bring-  ing into being that which had no being.” Man creates new syntheses out of  given material.# But God creates the material out of which the new syntheses 15Apr  ‘955 everything he is ‘through himself.”’*  * Tillich, ST, I, 254.  t Tillich, ST, I, 255.  $ In identifying creation  with the fall, Tillich seems  to be implying, against his  own intentions, that there  is a destructive principle  within God.

God’s sustaining creativity  We have seen that man has left the ground of his being in order to stand  upon himself, to actualize what he essentially is.164 But this actualized free-  dom remains continuously dependent on its creative ground. It is only in the  power of being-itself that the creature is able to resist nonbeing.

God’s directing creativity  When one thinks of God’s directing.creativity, he usually thinks of the pur-  pose of creation. But Tillich finds that the concept of “the purpose of cre-  ation” is at best an ambiguous concept. Creation, contends Tillich, has no  purpose beyond itself. Looked at from the point of view of the creature, the  purpose of creation is the creature itself, the actualization of its potentiali-  ties.16s Looked at from the point of view of the creator, “the purpose of cre-  ation is the exercise of his creativity, which has no purpose beyond itself be-  cause the divine life is essentially creative.”$ Tillich rejects both the Calvinistid  doctrine, which designates the purpose of creation as “the glory of God,” and  the Lutheran doctrine, which affirms that God creates the world in order to  have a communion of love with his creatures. In both of these theologies God  needs something that he could not have without creation.§ Such an idea Til-  lich rejects as pagan.  So the ambiguity of the concept “the purpose of creation” leads Tillich to  replace the concept by “the & of creativity”-the inner aim of fulfilling in  actuality what is beyond potentiality and actuality in the divine life. One of  * Tillich, ST, I, 262.  t Tillich, ST, I, 262.  $ Tillich, ST, 263, 264.  I Tillich, ST, I, 264.  of eternity creates things and time together. . . . God is essentially creative, and therefore he is  creative in every moment of temporal existence.”  167. Tillich, Systematic Theology, p. 262: “The latter refers to the given structures of reality, to  that which continues within the change, to the regular and calculable in things. Without the static  element, finite being would not be able to identify itself with itself or anything with anything.  Without it, neither expectation, nor action for the future, nor a place to stand upon would be  possible; and therefore being would not be possible. The faith in God’s sustaining creativity is the  faith in the continuity of the structure of reality as the basis for being and acting.”  168. Tillich, Systematic Theology, p. 263: “Creation has no purpose beyond itself. From the  point of view of the creature, the purpose of creation is the creature itself and the actualization  of its potentialities.” 429 </p><div id="pagenum"><p>The Martin Luther King, Jr. Papers Project </p></div><div id="pagenum"><p>15 Apr </p></div><p id="page">1955 the basic functions of the divine creativity is to drive every creature toward  such a fulfillment. This is the directing creativity of God in addition to his  originating and sustaining creativity. This is the side of the divine life which  is directed toward the future. The traditional term for God’s directing crea-  tivity is “providence.” * 169  The term providence means a fore-seeing (pro-videre) which is a fore-  ordering (“seeing to it”). Different interpretations of the concept of provi-  dence have resulted from this definition. There are those who have empha-  sized the element of foreseeing, making God an omniscient spectator who  knows what will happen but who does not interfere with the freedom of his  creatures. On the other hand there are those who have emphasized foreor-  dering, making God a planner who has ordered everything that will happen  “before the foundation of the world.” In the first interpretation the creatures  make their world, while God is a distant spectator. In the second interpreta-  tion, God is the only active agent, making the creatures mere cogs in a univer-  sal mechanism.t170  Tillich is emphatic in affirming that both of these interpretations of provi-  dence must be rejected. He sees providence as a permanent activity of God.  God is never a spectator; he is forever directing everything toward its fulfill-  ment.”l “Yet God’s directing creativity always creates through the freedom of  man and through the spontaneity and structural wholeness of all creatures.” *  Providence works through the polar elements of being, through conditions of  individual, social and universal existence, and through finitude, nonbeing,  and anxiety. All existential conditions are included in God’s directing crea-  tivity.I72 “Providence,” says Tillich, “is not interference; it is creation.

One function of the divine creativity is to drive every creature  toward such a fulfilment. Thus directing creativity must be added to originating and sustaining  creation. It is the side of the divine creativity which is related to the future. The traditional term  for directing creativity is ‘providence.”’  170.

In the first inter-  pretation the creatures make their world, and God remains a spectator; in the second interpre-  tation the creatures are cogs in a universal mechanism, and God is the only active agent.”  17 1.

He believes with the courage of faith that no condition  whatsoever can frustrate the fulfillment of his ultimate destiny.? In Pauline  terms it means that nothing can separate him from the love of God which is  in Christ Jesus.$173  Tillich discusses the question of theodicy under the concept of the directing  creativity of God. Faith in God’s directing creativity is continually challenged  by the presence of meaninglessness and futility in the universe. The question  forever arises, how can an almighty God be justified (theos-dike) in view of  realities in which no meaning whatsoever can be discovered? 174  In his discussion of the question of theodicy, Tillich divides evil into three  classes. First there is physical evil, pain and death-which, according to him,  offer no real problem because they are natural implications of creaturely fi-  nitude.§ Secondly, there is moral evil which is the tragic implication of crea-  turely freedom. Tillich contends that as creator, God cannot create what is  opposite to himself; he must create creative beings, beings which are free, and  in so far as they are free, independent and therefore estranged from the  ground of being.11 Finally, there is the (apparent) fact of meaninglessness and  futility. This, according to Tillich, is the sort of evil which offers genuine dif-  ficulties for theological belief. Examples cited by Tillich are “early death, de-  structive social conditions, feeble-mindedness and insanity, the undiminished  horrors of historical existence”-all of these being cases of entities which “are  excluded from any kind of fulfillment, even from free resistance against their  fulfillment.”# Tillich’s solution of the problem of evil of this third sort is very  difficult to understand, partly because of its excessive conciseness. Such evils  are described as “the negativities of creaturely existence.” But God himself  may be said to participate in the negativities of creaturely existence. God in-  cludes within himself “the finite and, with it, non-being.” “Nonbeing is eter-  nally conquered and the finite is eternally reunited within the infinity of the 15 Apr  1955  * Tillich, ST, I, 267.  t Tillich, ST, I, 267. the fact that they are im- the creator of evil.  $.

Tillich, Systematic Theology, p. 267: “The man who believes in providence does not believe  that a special divine activity will alter the conditions of finitude and estrangement. He believes,  and asserts with the courage of.faith, that no situation whatsoever can frustrate the fulfilment of  his ultimate destiny, that nothing can separate him from the love of God which is in Christ Jesus  (Romans, chap. S).”  174.

The confidence of every creature, its cour-  age to be, is rooted in faith in God as its creative ground.”t  6. The ontological elements  applied to God  How are the polar elements of everything that has being related in being-  itself? Tillich answers this question by asserting that the proper sense of the  concepts must be distinguished from their symbolic sense. The symbols taken  from finite relationships must be qualified when applied to God. In order to  symbolize divine life, the concepts must be stripped of certain existential con-  notation~.’~~ This is what Tillich proceeds to do in applying each of the onto-  logical elements to God.  i. Individualization and participation  Individualization is that self-centered character of everything in the light of  which a thing is a definite thing. In the case of man individualization means  * Tillich, ST, I, 270.  t Tillich, ST, I, 270.  175. Demos, Review of Systematic Theology, p. 702: “In these two pages the author divides evil  into three classes: (a) Physical evil, pain, and death-which, according to him, offer no real prob-  lem because they are natural implications of creaturely finitude. Yet surely they are evils, and the  fact that they are implicated in the finitude of all creaturely being does not help at all. For if  creation is of finitude, and finitude be evil, then God is the creator of evil. (b) Then there is moral  evil which is the tragic implication of creaturely freedom. Professor Tillich makes what seems to  me a wholly valid point, that, as a creator, God cannot create what is opposite to himself; he must  create creative beings, beings which are free, and in so far as they are free, independent and  therefore estranged from the ground of being. . . . (c) Finally, there is the (apparent) fact of  meaninglessness and futility-and this, according to the author, is the only sort of evil which  offers genuine difficulties for theological belief.

The element of participation is in polar relation with individu-  alization. 178  When applied to God, these elements must be qualified. God is the “prin-  ciple” of individualization and participation; God as being-itself is the ground  of both. This does not mean that there is something alongside God in which  he participates. God’s participation and individualization are symbolical. God  is not subject to the polarities of the ontological elements.179  If one asks the question, in what sense can God be called an individual,  Tillich would answer that this question is only meaningful in the sense that  God be called the “absolute participant.” And, according to Tillich, “this  can only mean that both individualization and participation are rooted in the  ground of the divine life and that God is equally “near” to each of them while  transcending them both.”* 15 Apr  1955  ii. Dynamics and form  The dynamic-form polarity gives rise to several symbols which are central  for any present day doctrine of God. Terms such as potentiality, vitality, and  self-transcendence are indicated in the term “dynamics,” while the term “form”  embraces actuality, intentionality, and self-preservation.’s1  Potentiality and actuality appear in the famous Aristotelian-Thomistic for-  mula that God is actus-purus.

In the case of man individualiza-  tion means the indivisible unity of consciousness, selfhood. But man’s individualization is not  absolute or complete. The element of participation is in polar relation with individualization.”  179. Boozer, “Place of Reason,” p. 245: “God is the ‘principle’ of individualization and par-  ticipation; God as being-itself is the ground of both. This does not mean that there is something  alongside God in which God participates. . . . God’s participation and his individualization are  symbolical. . . . God is not subject to the polarity of the ontological elements.”  180. Tillich, Systematic Theology, p. 244: “The question arises in what sense God can be called  an individual. Is it meaningful to call him the ‘absolute individual’? The answer must be that it is  meaningful only in the sense that he can be called the ‘absolute participant.”’  181. Tillich, Systematic Theology, pp. 245-246: “The polarity of dynamics and form supplies  the material basis for a group of symbols which are central for any present-day doctrine of God.

Actuality free from any element of potentiality is not alive.  The God who is actus-purus, affirms Tillich, is not the living God.*18*  This situation has induced many thinkers to emphasize the dynamics in  God “and to depreciate the stabilization of dynamics in pure actuality.” This  first element is called the Ungrund by Bohme, the first potency by Schelling,  the “given” in God by Brightman, me-onic freedom in Berdyaev, and the  contingent in Hartshorne.? Each of these cases points symbolically to a quality  of the divine life which is analogous to what appears as dynamics in the on-  tological structure. 183  Tillich’s symbolic application of the dynamics-form polarity to the divine  life causes him to reject a nonsymbolic, ontological doctrine of God as becom-  ing. Being, contends Tillich, is not in balance with becoming.184  Being comprises becoming and rest, becoming as an implication of dynamics and  rest as an implication of form. If we say that God is being-itself, this includes  both rest and becoming, both the static and the dynamic elements. However, to  speak of a “becoming” God disrupts the balance between dynamics and form  and subjects God to a process which has the character of a fate or which is com-  pletely open to the future and has the character of an absolute accident.$  What Tillich is getting at is now clear. In man there is a tension between  dynamics and form. Vitality or dynamics is the power of life, open in all di-  rections toward channels of expression. But man’s vitality is conditioned by  his form.1s5  The dynamics-form polarity, when applied to God, takes on a different  * Tillich, ST, I, 246.  t Tillich, ST, I, 246.  $ Tillich, ST, I, 247.  182.

Freedom and destiny  In finite life freedom and destiny are in a polar relation of interdepend-  ence. In finite life destiny is the basis of freedom and freedom participates in  shaping destiny. But when the elements of freedom and destiny are applied  to divine life their meaning is altered.187 Tillich affirms that if we speak of  God as free in a non-symbolic sense, we are confronted with the unanswerable  question of whether the structure of freedom is not itself something given in  relation to which God has no freedom. Because of this difficulty, Tillich as-  serts that freedom in God, like the other ontological concepts must be under-  stood symbolically.188 When it is so understood,  freedom means that that which is man’s ultimate concern is in no way dependent  on man or on any finite concern. Only that which is unconditional can be the  expression of unconditional concern. A conditional God is no God.$  Likewise, the term destiny cannot be applied to God if the connotation of a  “destiny-determining’’ power above God is given. But both freedom and des-  tiny can be applied symbolically to the divine life if one affirms that in God  freedom and destiny are identical. God is his destiny. God’s freedom does not  shape his destiny. There is an absolute unity and identity of freedom and  destiny in God.§  * Tillich, ST, I, 247.  ?.

The traditional attributes of God </p></div><p id="page">‘955  One of the most illuminating sections in Tillich’s discussion of the question  of God is his analysis of the traditional attributes of God. Tillich feels that  theologians have too long interpreted the attributes of God quantitatively.  This type of interpretation has led to both illogical and irrational ideas about  the nature of God. So Tillich proceeds to give a qualitative interpretation to  the attributes of God rather than a quantitative one. We have already dis-  cussed Tillich’s interpretation of the omnipotence of God. Now we may turn  to a discussion of the eternity, the omnipresence, and the omniscience of God.  i. God is eternal  The concept of eternity is a genuine religious concept. It takes the place of  something like omnitemporality, which would be the analogy to omnipotence  and omnipresence. In his interpretation of the concept of eternity, Tillich  contends that the concept must be protected against two misinterpretations.  The first misinterpretation is the tendency to look upon eternity as timeless-  ness. The meaning of & in Hebrew and of aiones in Greek does not in-  dicate timelessness. Rather than meaning timelessness, eternity means “the  power of embracing all periods of time.”” If God is a living God, asserts Til-  lich, he must include temporality and with this a relation to the modes of time.  Philosophers throughout the ages have realized that eternity includes tem-  porality. Plato, for instance, called time the moving image of eternity. For  Plato eternity included time, even though it was the time of circular move-  ment. Hegel pointed to a temporality within the absolute. These theories, says  Tillich, point to the fact that eternity is not timelessness.1Eg  Another misinterpretation that Tillich finds surrounding the concept of  eternity is the tendency to look upon it as the endlessness of time. The concept  of endless time, called “bad infinity” by Hegel, means the endless reiteration  of temporality. Tillich looks upon this tendency to elevate the dissected mo-  * Tillich, ST, I, 274.  not itself something given in relation to which God has no freedom. The answer can only be that  freedom, like the other ontological concepts, must be understood symbolically.”  189. Tillich, Systematic Theology, pp. 274-275: “‘Eternity’ is a genuine religious word. It takes  the place of something like omni- or all-temporality, which would be the analogy to omnipotence,  omnipresence, etc. . . . The concept of eternity must be protected against two misinterpretations.  Eternity is neither timelessness nor the endlessness of time. The meaning of ohm in Hebrew and  of aiones in Greek does not indicate timelessness. . . . If we call God a living God, we affirm that  he includes temporality and with this a relation to the modes of time. Even Plato could not  exclude temporality from eternity; he called time the moving image of eternity. . . . For Plato  eternity included time, even though it was the time of circular movement. . . .

Now the question arises: “What is the relation of eternity to the modes of  time?” Tillich answers this question in terms of an analogy which is found in  human experience, that is, the unity of remembered past and anticipated fu-  ture in an experienced present. This analogy implies a symbolic approach to  the meaning of eternity. Eternity is symbolized as an eternal present (nunc  eternum).? But this nunc eternum is not simultaneity. Simultaneity would  erase the different modes of time. The eternal present is moving from past to  future but without ceasing to be present.lgL  It is through faith in the eternity of God that one finds the courage to  conquer the negativities of the temporal process. Both the anxiety of the past  and that of the future pass away. The dissected moments of time are united  in eternity. Here, and not in the doctrine of the human soul, Tillich finds the  certainty of man’s participation in eternal life.Ig2 “The hope of eternal life,”  asserts Tillich, “is based not on a substantial quality of man’s soul but on his  participation in the eternity of the divine life.” $ 15 Apr  1955  ii. God is omnipresent  God’s relation to space, as his relation to time, is interpreted by Tillich in  qualitative terms. God, avers Tillich, is neither endlessly extended in space, as  * Tillich, ST, I, 275.  t Tillich, ST, I, 275.  $ Tillich, ST, I, 276.  190. Tillich, Systematic Theology, p. 275: “Endless time, correctly called ‘bad infinity’ by Hegel,  is the endless reiteration of temporality.

For God it would mean his subjection to a superior power, namely, to the structure of dissected  temporality.”  191. Tillich, Systematic Theology, p. 275: “‘What is the relation of eternity to the modes of time?’  An answer demands use of the only analogy to eternity found in human experience, that is, the  unity of remembered past and anticipated future in an experienced present. Such an analogy  implies a symbolic approach to the meaning of eternity. . . . Eternity must first be symbolized as  an eternal present (nunc eternum). But this nunc eternum is not simultaneity or the negation of an  independent meaning of past and future. The eternal present is moving from past to future but  without ceasing to be present.”  192. Tillich, Systematic Theology, p. 276: “Faith in the eternal God is the basis for a courage  which conquers the negativities of the temporal process. Neither the anxiety of the past nor that  of the future remains. . . . The dissected moments of time are united in eternity.

The tendency  to interpret omnipresence as an extension of the divine substance through all  space subjects God to dissected spatiality and puts him alongside himself sac-  rificing the personal centers of the divine life.* The tendency to interpret  omnipresence as meaning that God is present “personally” in a circumscribed  place is equally inadequate. The spatial symbols of above and below should  never be taken literally. The statement “God is in heaven,” for instance, does  Lot mean that he “lives in” or “descends from” a special place; it means,  rather, that his life is qualitatively different from creaturely existence.? Ig3  It is also improper to interpret omnipresence as spacelessness. Tillich holds  that punctuality in the divine life must be rejected as much as simultaneity  and timelessness. Extension is found in the ground of the divine life in which  everything spatial is rooted. But God is not subject to this spatial existence; he  transcends it and participates in it.194 “God’s omnipresence is his creative par-  ticipation in the spatial existence of his creatures.” $  The religious value of God’s omnipresence is immense. It overcomes the  anxiety of not having a space for one’s self. It means that wherever man is he  is “at home” in the ground of God. One is always “in the sanctuary” when he  experiences God’s omnipresence. In such a presence of God every place is a  “holy place.” There is in that situation no difference between the sacred and  the secular.§195  * Tillich, ST, I, 277.  t Tillich, ST, I, 277. * Tillich, ST, I, 277.  8 Tillich, ST, I, 278.  193. Tillich, Systematic Theology, pp. 276-277: “God’s relation to space, as his relation to time,  must be interpreted in qualitative terms. God is neither endlessly extended in space nor limited  to a definite space; nor is he spaceless. A theology inclined toward pantheist formulation prefers  the first alternative, while a theology with deistic tendencies chooses the second alternative. Om-  nipresence can be interpreted as an extension of the divine substance through all spaces. This,  however, subjects God to dissected spatiality and puts him, so to speak, alongside himself sacrific-  ing the personal center of the divine life. . . . Further, omnipresence can be interpreted to mean  that God is present ‘personally’ in a circumscribed place (in heaven above) but also simultaneously  present with his power every place (in the earth beneath). But this is equally inadequate. The  spatial symbols of above and below should not be taken literally in any respect. . . . ‘God is in  heaven’; this means that his life is qualitatively different from creaturely existence.

God is omniscient ‘5 *Pr </p></div><p id="page">‘955  In traditional theology omniscience is the faculty of a highest being who is  supposed to know all objects, past, present, and future, and beyond this, ev-  erything that might have happened if what has happened had not happened.  But Tillich looks upon this interpretation of omniscience as illogical and ab-  surd. The absurdity of such an interpretation is due to the impossibility of  subsuming God under the subject-object scheme. If one speaks of the uncon-  ditional character of divine knowledge, therefore, one must speak symboli-  cally, indicating that God is not present in an all-permeating manner but that  he is present spirit~a1ly.l~~ It means that  nothing is outside the centered unity of his life; nothing is strange, dark, hidden,  isolated, unapproachable. Nothing falls outside the structure of being. The  dynamic element cannot break the unity of the form; the abysmal quality cannot  swallow the rational quality of the divine life.*  This has tremendous implications for man’s personal and cultural exis-  tence. In personal life it means that there is no absolute darkness in one’s  being. Faith in God’s omniscience overcomes the anxiety of the dark and the  hidden. The divine omniscience is ultimately the logical foundation of the  belief in the openness of reality to human knowledge. We are able to gain  knowledge because we participate in divine knowledge. We are able to reach  truth because the divine life in which we are rooted embodies all truth.lg7  8. Divine love and divine justice  Love and justice have often been looked upon as two distinct attributes of  God. But Tillich feels that such a position is due to a misconception of the  * Tillich, ST, I, 279.  196.

The absurdity of such an  image is due to the impossibility of subsuming God under the subject-object scheme, although  this structure is grounded in the divine life. If one speaks, therefore, of divine knowledge and of  the unconditional character of the divine knowledge, one speaks symbolically, indicating that God  is not present in an all-permeating manner but that he is present spiritually.”  197. Tillich, Systematic Theology, p. 279: “This certainty has implications for man’s personal  and cultural existence. In personal life it means that there is no absolute darkness in one’s  being. . . . And, on the other hand, the anxiety of the dark and the hidden is overcome in the  faith of the divine omniscience. . . . Therefore, the divine omniscience is the logical (though not  always conscious) foundation of the belief in the openness of reality to human knowledge.

Justice, contends Tillich, is a part of love. Love  is the ontological concept. Justice has no independent ontological standing.  Justice is dependent on love. It is a part of love’s activity. With this statement  of the complementary nature of love and justice we may examine them  separately. lg8  i. The divine love  Love, for Tillich, is an ontological concept. He finds the ontological nature  of love expressed in the tendency of every life-process to unite a trend toward  separation with a trend toward reunion. Such a tendency is based on the po-  larity of individualization and participation. Love is absent where there is no  individualization, and love can be fully realized only where there is full indi-  vidualization, in man. But the individual also longs to return to the unity to  which he belongs, in which he participates by his ontological nature.*Ig9 This  is what Tillich means when he says that love is not the union of the strange  but the reunion of the estranged.?  To say that God is love literally is to apply the experience of separation and  reunion to the divine life. This, however, is impossible since God is not subject  to the ontological elements. Therefore one must speak symbolically of God as  love. When God is spoken of as love, the meaning is that the divine life has  the character of love but beyond the distinction between potentiality and  actuality.$.200  In order to gain a clearer meaning of the divine love, Tillich distinguishes  between several different types of love.§ In each type of lo-ve there is a quest  * Tillich, ST, I, 279. more recent work Tillich elaborating these lectures,  t Tillich, LPJ, 25. affirms that it is improper that there are not types  + Tillich, ST, 1, 280. to speak of types of love. but qualifications of love.”  ology Tillich refers to love, but qualities of love.  types of love.

Tillich, Systematic Theology, pp. 279-280: “Love is an ontological concept. . . .

There is love as libido which is the movement of the needy to- </p></div><p id="page">ward that which fulfills the need. There is love as philia which is movement  of the equal toward union with the equal. There is love as 9 which is the  movement of that which is lower in power and meaning to that which is  higher. In all three of these forms of love the element of desire is present.  But there is a from of love which transcends these, namely, the desire to fulfill  the longing of the other being. This is love as agape. All love, except agape, is  dependent on contingent characteristics which change and are partial, such  as repulsion and attraction, passion and sympathy.” Agape is independent of  these states. It affirms the other unconditionally. It is agape that suffers and  forgives. It seeks the personal fulfillment of the other.  It is this type of love that is the basis for the assertion that God is love.201  “God works toward the fulfillment of every creature and toward the bringing-  together into the unity of his life all who are separated and disrupted.”? It is  in this sense, and in this sense only that God is called love. None of the other  types of love can be applied to God. Certainly not libido, because God is not  in need of anything. Philia cannot properly symbolize God’s love, because  there is no equality between man and God. Moreover, 9 cannot properly  synbolize God’s love, because God in his eternity transcends the fulfillment  and non-fulfillment of reality. The basic and only adequate symbol for God’s  love is agape.$  We may raise the question of the possibility of divine self love at this point.  Tillich is reluctant to speak of self-love on the human level, since he sees love  as the drive towards the reunion of the separated. He contends that within  the unity of self-consciousness there is no real separation, comparable to the  separation of self-centered being from all other being.$ But although Tillich  is reluctant to speak of self-love on the human level, he is quite willing to  speak of divine self-love. He says in one instance that “man’s love of God is  the love with which God loves himself.”(l This is an expression of the truth  that God is a subject even when he seems to be an object. It is a statement 15 Apr  1955  * Tillich, ST, I, 280. )I Tillich, ST, I, 282.

Love as er8s is the movement of that which is lower in power and meaning to that which  is higher. It is obvious that in all three the element of desire is present. . . . But there is a form of  love which transcends these, namely, the desire for the fulfilment of the longing of the other  being, the longing for his ultimate fulfilment. All love, except agape?, is dependent on contingent  characteristics which change and are partial. It is dependent on repulsion and attraction, on  passion and sympathy. Agape? is independent of these states. It affirms the other uncondi-  tionally. . . . It suffers and forgives. It seeks the personal fulfilment of the other. . . .

As we shall see subsequently, the trinitarian distinc-  tions (separation and reunion) make it possible to speak of divine self-love.*02  Without separation from one’s self, self-love is impossible. . . . Through the sepa-  ration within himself God loves himself and through separation from himself  (in creaturely freedom) God fulfills his love of himself-primarily because he  loves that which is estranged from himself.*  ii. The divine justice  As we have seen, justice has no independent ontological standing. Justice is  dependent on love. Justice is really an act of love protesting against that which  violates love. Whenever an individual violates the structure of love, judgment  and condemnation follow. But they do not follow by an act of divine retribu-  tion; they follow by the reaction of God’s loving power against that which  violates l~~e.~~~ “Condemnation is not the negation of love but the negation  of the negation of love.”? It is the way in which that which resists love, i.e.  that which resists being reunited to that from which it is separated, is left to  separation, with an implied and inescapable self-destru~tion.~~~  Tillich feels that the ontological character of love not only solves the prob-  lem of the relation of love and retributive justice, but also provides theology  with the possibility of using the symbol “the wrath of God.” The wrath of God  is not an affect alongside God’s love nor is it a motive for action alongside his  providence;Z05 “it is the emotional symbol for the work of love which rejects  and leaves to self-destruction what resists it.”$ In this sense the metaphorical  symbol “the wrath of God” is necessary and unavoidable.206  Tillich finds the final expression of the unity of love and justice in the sym-  * Tillich, ST, I, 282.

The trinity  For Tillich the trinity is not the illogical and irrational assertion that three  are one and one is three. It is a qualitative rather than a quantitative charac-  terization of God. It is an attempt to express the richness and complexity of  the divine life.zo*  The first person of the trinity is abyss. It is the abysmal character of God,  the element of power which is the basis of the Godhead, “which makes God  God.”t209 As we have seen, this first principle is the root of God’s majesty, the  unapproachable intensity of his being.

But Tillich does not stop with this polar concept of God’s  nature. There is a third principle, that of spirit.213  Spirit is that principle in which power and meaning, abyss and ground are  united. Spirit stands for the unity of all the polar opposites: of power with  meaning, of the static with the dynamic, even of mind with body.* God is no  nearer one “part” of being than he is to another. He is as near the creative  darkness of the unconscious as he is to the critical light of cognitive reas0n.2~5  “Spirit is the power through which meaning lives, and it is the meaning which  gives direction to power.” f  It is through the concept of the Spirit that Tillich explains the self-  separating and self-returning activity of God. Through the Spirit God goes  out of himself, the Spirit proceeds from the divine ground. He gives actuality  to that which is potential in the divine ground.*16 “Through the Spirit the  divine fullness is posited in the divine life as something definite, and at the  same time it is reunited in the divine ground.”$  Tillich emphasizes the point that a consideration of the trinitarian principles  is not the Christian doctrine of the Trinity. It is preparation for it. The doc-  trinal formulation of the Trinity can be discussed only after the Christological  dogma has been elaborated.§ But in order to speak meaningfully of the living  God it is necessary to discuss the trinitarian principles.217  * Tillich seems to be  abusing language here,  for if religious common  sense means anything in  saying that God is a spirit,  it means that God is @  material.

Demos, Review of Systematic Theology, p. 700: “Spirit, he says, stands for the unity of all  the polar opposites: of power with meaning, of the static with the dynamic, even of mind with  body (pp. 849-251). Surely he is abusing language here, for if religious common sense means  anything in saying that God is a spirit, it means that God is immaterial. I think that the responsi-  bility for such unnatural changes of meaning must be charged to the dialectical principle, which  necessitates that a given meaning should embrace its opposite. I doubt that any precision of  meaning-indeed any meaning-is possible under such conditions.”  2 15. Tillich, Systematic Theology, p. 250: “God is not nearer to one ‘part’ of being or to a special  function of being than he is to another. As Spirit he is as near to the creative darkness of the  unconscious as he is to the critical light of cognitive reason.”  216. Tillich, Systematic Theology, p. 251: “It is the Spirit in whom God ’goes out from’ himself,  the Spirit proceeds from the divine ground. He gives actuality to that which is potential in the  divine ground and ‘outspoken’ in the divine logos.”  2 I 7.

The question of the </p></div><p id="page">personality of God ‘5 Apr  ‘955  We have seen throughout the discussion that Tillich continually talks of  God in terms of power. Now the question arises whether Tillich’s God is an  unconscious reservoir of power or whether he is a conscious person. An an-  swer to this question is crucial for any adequate interpretation of Tillich’s  God-concept.  We have seen that Tillich considers all statements about God as being of a  symbolic nature, except the statement that God is being-itself. We cannot say,  for instance, that God is living in the literal sense of the word because life is  literally “the process in which potential being becomes actual being,” and God  “transcends” the distinction between potential and actual. But God does live  in the sense that He is the ground of life. Tillich carries this same method of  thinking over into the question of the personality of God. He insists that the  symbol, “personal God,” does not mean that God is a person. “It means that  God is the ground of everything personal and that he carries within himself  the ontological power of personality.” *218 Tillich thinks that the tendency to  speak of God as “a person” was a nineteenth century creation, brought into  being through the Kantian separation of nature ruled by physical law from  personality ruled by moral law.21g Under this influence theism made God “a  heavenly, completely perfect person who resides above the world and man-  kind.”? But there is no evidence for the existence of such a highest person.  At best Tillich finds the symbol “personal God” quite confusing.  In answering a criticism which Einstein raised against the idea of a personal  God, Tillich admitted that most concepts of a personal God contradicted the  scientific interpretation of nature. He writes:  The concept of a “Personal God,” interfering with natural events or being an  independent cause of natural events makes God a natural object besides others,  an object amongst objects, a being amongst beings, maybe the highest, but any-  how a being. This, indeed, is the destruction, not only of the physical system, but  even more the destruction of any meaningful ideas of God.$  * Tillich, ST, I, 245.  t Tillich, ST, I, 245.  8 Tillich, Art.

In a sense God is the supra-personal.  The supra-personal is not an “It,” or more exactly, it is a “He” as much as it is  an “It,” and it is above both of them. But if the “He” element is left out, the “It”  element transforms the alleged supra-personal into sub-personal, as it usually  happens in monism and pantheism.*  Now we can clearly see that there is a basic inconsistency in Tillich’s thought  at this point. On the one hand Tillich’s thought suggests the sub-personalism  of Oriental Vedantism. On the other hand Tillich recognizes personality as a  precious symbol denoting the unconditional, the ground and abyss of all be-  ing. He contends that this kind of symbolsim is indispensable and must be  maintained against pantheistic and naturalistic criticism, lest religion fall back  to the level of a primitive-demonic pre-personalism.tzzl Certainly this is a fla-  grant contradiction. It seems that Tillich both wants a personal God and does  not want a personal God.222  At any rate, all of Tillich’s conclusions tend to point to an impersonal God.  Despite his warning that God is not less than personal, we see traits through-  out Tillich’s thinking that point to a God that is less than personal. Even those  things which Tillich says about God with personalistic implications are finally  given impersonal explanations. For instance, Tillich speaks of God as love.  But on closer scrutiny we discover that love, for Tillich, is just the dialectical  principle of the union of opposites. Tillich’s use of the word love inevitable  reminds one of the love (and strife) of Empodocles, who meant by “love” no  more than the attraction of the elements for one another.z23 At one point  * Tillich, Art.

But even this is distorted through Tillich’s insistence that the  abyss is what makes God God.  So Tillich ends with a God who is a sub-personal reservoir of power, some-  what akin to the impersonalism of Hindu Vedantism. He chooses the less than  personal to explain personality, purpose, and meaning. 15 Apr  1955  1 1. Is Tillich an absolute quantitative  monist?  We come to a question at this point which has been cropping up throughout  our discussion of Tillich’s God-concept, viz., the question of whether Tillich  holds to an absolute quantitative monism. Certainly there is much in Tillich’s  conception of God which suggest that he does. For instance, his emphasis on  God’s participation in every life as its ground and aim is monistic.* Also he  can talk of God’s going out of himself and resting in himself. “The finite is  posited as finite within the process of divine life, but it is reunited with the  infinite within the same process.”? Again he says: “God is infinite because he  has the finite within himself united with his infinity.”+ Still again he says: “The  divine life is creative, actualizing itself in inexhaustible abundance.” 0 The  similarity of Tillich’s view at this point to Hegel’s philosophy of spirit and  Plotinus’ philosophy of the One inclines one to interpret Tillich as an absolute  Perhaps Tillich’s most explicit statement of monism is his contention that  “man’s love of God is the love with which God loves himself. . . . The divine  life is the divine self-love.”ll Tillich makes the same assertion about divine  knowledge. “If there is knowledge of God, it is God who knows himself  through man.”# Passages such as these cited indicate an absolute monism.z25  There are some passages, on the other hand, which imply a quantitative  * Tillich, ST, I, 245. 0 Tillich, ST, I, 282.  t Tillich, ST, I, 251.

Boozer, “Place of Reason,” p. 61: “The similarity of Tillich’s theology with Hegel’s phi-  losophy of spirit and Plotinus’ philosophy of the One inclines one to interpret Tillich as an  absolute monist. God goes out from himself. He rests in himself. ‘The finite is posited as finite  within the process of the divine life, but it is reunited with the infinite within the same process.’  ‘God is infinite because he has the finite within himself united with his infinity.’ ‘The divine life is  creative, actualizing itself in inexhaustible abundance.”’  225. Boozer, “Place of Reason,” p. 62: “But perhaps the most convincing statement of monism  is in terms of love, that ‘man’s love of God is the love with which God loves himself. . . . The  divine life is the divine self-love.’ . . . Passages such as these certainly indicate an absolute mo-  nism.” Ellipsis in quotation from Tillich is in the original text of Boozer’s dissertation. Boozer’s  footnote to the quotation reads: “Actually Tillich makes the same assertion about divine knowl-  edge. ‘If there is a knowledge of God, it is God who knows himself through man.”’ 447 </p><div id="pagenum"><p>The Martin Luther King, Jr. Papers Project </p></div><div id="pagenum"><p>15 Apr </p></div><p id="page">1955 pluralism. Tillich insists, for instance, that man is free. In fact he defines the  nature of man as “finite freedom.”” Tillich affirms that there would be no  history unless man were to some degree free; that is, to some extent, indepen-  dent from God. Tillich goes on to insist that one of the basic characteristics of  existence is a separation of man and God. Man in existence is conscious of  being separated from what he ought to be. He is to some extent “outside” the  divine life.2z6 This means that he stands “in actualized freedom, in an exis-  tence which is no longer united with essence.”tzZ7  It is obvious that this represents a basic contradiction in Tillich’s thought,  and he nowhere seeks explicitly to resolve the contradiction. Is any resolution  of these seeming contradictions possible? 2z8 Boozer, in interpreting Tillich’s  thought at this point, thinks that the contradiction can be resolved on the basis  of Tillich’s distinction between essence and existence. Boozer writes:  Essentially God is all in all; God is one, and man is not actual as a separate being.  Man is a part of God. But in existence, in the realm of God’s creation there is a  partial separation of man from God through the actualization of man’s finite  freedom. The sustaining structure of existence is still unity with God. But the  unity is not complete in existence. In existence, then, God and man are separate  to an extent, and there is pluralism.$  It is probably an oversimplification to say that this resolves the contradiction  completely, for a contradiction cannot be resolved merely by denying one  term of it (in this case pluralism), Moreover, even if it is gratned that Tillich  holds to an ultimate ontological monism there is the further contradiction of  how man can be free in such a monistic system. Freedom implies metaphysical  otherness, and it is hardly possible to hold to an ultimate ontological monism  and the freedom of man simultaneously. This is a contradiction that Tillich  never seems to resolve.  In spite of the foregoing, however, Boozer is basically sound in his inter-  pretation of Tillich’s God as the only metaphysical reality; a God who goes out  of himself into existence and returns to himself. At least three quotations  from Tillich give weight to this conclusion.  * Tillich, Art. (ig3g),  t Tillich, ST, I, 255.  $ Boozer, PRTCG, 62. 202.  226.

He is to some extent ‘outside’  the divine life.”  227. Boozer quoted this passage from Tillich (“Place of Reason,” pp. 62-63).  228.

Selfseparating is the abbreviation  for separating itself from itself towards the complete individualization of the self  having itself. Selfreturning is the abbreviation of the return of life to itself in the  power of returning 10~e.p  In a very informative article on the nature of man, Tillich asserts that man  has a threefold nature, viz., an essential nature, an existential nature, and an  eschatological nature. It becomes clear now that Tillich applies this same  threefold nature to God. It is through such an interpretation that we can un-  derstand Tillich’s statement that God “is the eternal process in which separa-  tion is posited and is overcome by reunion.” When one considers the fullness  of God in the three natures, many contradictions are reconciled.  The conclusion is that Tillich holds to an ultimate ontological monism both  qualitative and quantitative. God is ultimately the only metaphysical reality.  The life of man is a phase of the actualization of God and not a separate  metaphysical reality.z3z  * Tillich, ST, I, 234.  t Tillich, ST, I, 242.  $ Tillich, Art. (ig4g)2,  ‘5.  229.

The basic position around which Tillich’s thought is oriented is that of an  ultimate ontological monism, both quantitative and qualitative. . . .

His emphasis is theocentric throughout. He never wearies of pointing  out that God (creative good) must be dominant over all created good in the  devotion of man. Wieman plainly states that his purpose in the field of reli-  gion is to promote a theocentric religion over against the prevalent anthropo-  centrism. In this endeavor he stresses the fact that men must worship the  actuality of God and not their ideas about God. Further, it is imperative that  men not allow their wishes and needs to shape their ideas of God but rather  that the ideas of God be shaped solely in the light of objective evidence.  It is the success of this approach that constitutes the significance of Wieman.  “One of the most persuasive reconstructed forms of theism that has appeared  in this country,” says Bernard Meland, “is the philosophy of religion devel-  oped by Henry Nelson Wieman.”” D. C. Macintosh in a more definite but no  less laudatory statement says:  No one has gone as far as Professor Henry N. Wieman in suggesting a variety of  ways in which the divinely functioning reality may be characterized and defined  and at the same time known, strictly speaking, to exist. His definitions of God,  insofar as God may be undeniably affirmed to exist, have a more curious interest,  aiming to formulate the irreducible minimum of religious knowledge, they gen-  erally succeed sufficiently to have positive value for reasonable reassurance in  religion.?  As we shall see throughout this chapter, Wieman’s conception of God is  quite different from that of traditional theism. He has classified his view as  “theistic naturalism.” This means that he would avoid any ultimate separation  of God from nature; that he views God as one natural process or structure of  processes among others which can be apprehended in clearly defined ways  with predictable results. Such a process or structure of processes may be su-  perhuman but cannot be “supernatural,” because nature is defined by him as  “what we know through the interaction between the physiological organism  and its environment,” while the supernatural is unknowable by definition. *  * Meland, MMW, 139.  t Macintosh, PRK, 165.  1.

The nature of God  Wieman contends that it has been his purpose “so to formulate the idea of  God that the question of God’s existence becomes a dead issue.”” To accom-  plish this he has offered as a “minimal” definition of God the following: “God  is that something upon which human life is most dependent for its security,  welfare, and increasing abundance . . . that something of supreme value  which constitutes the most important condition.” t But Wieman has devel-  oped this minimal definition in various ways. At one point in his intellectual  pilgrimage he suggested that God as so defined is “that interaction between  individuals, groups, and ages which generates and promotes the greatest  mutuality of good . . . the richest possible body of shared experience.”$ In  another volume he speaks of God as “that interaction which sustains and  magnifies personality . . . the process of progressive integration”;§ while in  another place he undertakes to defend Whitehead’s view of God as “the prin-  ciple of concretion.”)13 In his most mature work, The Source of Human Good,  Wieman defines God as the “creative event.” He feels that this latter definition  most adequately expresses the nature of God.  * Wieman, Art.

God as the creative event  True to his naturalistic predilections Wieman defines God as the “creative  e~ent.”~ God as creative event is that process of reorganization which gener-  ates new meanings, integrates them with the old, and endows each event as it  occurs with a wider range of reference.* God as creative event is actually cre-  ative good, standing in contrast to both kinds of created good, one of which  is instrumental and the other intrinsic. It is by means of this creative good that  systems of meaning having intrinsic value, previously so disconnected that the  qualities of the one could not get across to the other, become so united that  each is enriched by qualities derived from the other.6  The total creative event is made up of four subevents. This does not mean  that there are four distinct subevents working apart from each other which  constitutes the creative event. Wieman makes it clear that the distinctions are  made only for the purpose of analysis, and must never obscure the unitary  character of the creative event.’  The four subevents are: emerging awareness of qualitative meaning through  communication with other persons; integrating new meanings with ones pre-  viously acquired; expanding and enriching the appreciable world by a new  structure of interrelatedness; a widening and deepening of community.8 We  shall examine each of these separately.  * This is quite reminis- (Morgan, Alexander); tague); “the value-actual-  cent of the thought of a “holistic evolution” izing function of human  long line of naturalistic (Smuts); “a thrust toward imagination within the to-  thinkers.

On a draft of the dissertation Schilling suggested that King “avoid repetition” of Wieman’s  definition of God as the creative event (King, Draft of chapter 4, 1954-1955, MLKP-MBU:  5. Wieman, “Authority and the Normative Approach,” p. 190: “Some call it the ‘principle of  concretion’ (Whitehead); ‘the progression of emergents’ (Morgan, Alexander, Calhoun); ‘holistic  evolution’ (Smuts); . . . ‘a thrust toward concentration, organization, and life’ (Montague); . . .  ‘the value-actualizing function of human imagination within the total cosmic-social matrix that  sustains it’ (Dewey).”  6. Wieman, Source of Human Good, p. 56: “When good increases, a process of reorganization  is going on, generating new meanings, integrating them with the old, endowing each event as it  occurs with a wider range of reference. . . . It is creative good, standing in contrast to both kinds  of created good we have been considering. By means of this creative good, systems of meaning  having intrinsic value, previously disconnected so that the qualities of the one could not get across  to the other, are so unified that each is enriched by qualities derived from the other.”  7.

Qualitative meaning consists of  actual events so related that each acquires qualities from the other. Every  living organism so reacts as to break the passage of existence into units called  “events” and to relate these to one another in the manner called “qualitative  meaning.”* This may be done by the organism without the aid of linguistic  communication. In such a case the range and richness of qualitative meaning  is very limited. But the world of meaning and quality expands to its greatest  compass when the single organism is able to acquire the qualitative meanings  developed by other organisms and add them to its own. Therefore the first  subevent in the total creative event is this emerging awareness in the indi-  vidual of qualitative meaning communicated to it from some other organism.  Wieman admits that interaction between the organism and its surroundings,  by which new qualitative meaning is created without communication, is cer-  tainly ~reative.~ But it is the creative event as it works through intercommu-  nication in human society and history that the miracle happens and “creativity  breaks free from obstacles which elsewhere imprison its power.” lo  (2) The second subevent  One of the chief sources of the growth of personality appears when these  new meanings derived from others are integrated with meanings previously  * Wieman, SHG, 58  t Wieman, SHG, 59.  meanings with others previously acquired; expanding the richness of quality in the appreciable  world by enlarging its meaning; deepening the community among those who participate in this  total creative event of intercommunication.”  9. Wieman, Source of Human Good, p. 58: “Let us remember that qualitative meaning consists  of actual events so related that each acquires qualities from the others. Every living organism so  reacts as to break the passage of existence into units or intervals called ‘events’ and to relate these  to one another in the manner here called ‘qualitative meaning.’ So long as this is done by the  organism without the aid of linguistic communication, the range and richness of qualitative  meaning is very limited. Not until the single organism is able to acquire the qualitative meanings  developed by other organisms and add them to its own can the world of meaning and quality  expand to any great compass. Therefore the first subevent in the total creative event producing  value distinctively human is this emerging awareness in the individual of qualitative meaning  communicated to it from some other organism. Interaction between the organism and its sur-  roundings, by which new qualitative meaning is created without communication or prior to com-  munication, is certainly creative.”  io. On a draft of the dissertation Schilling underlined “it is the creative event” and “that the  miracle happens” and wrote in the margin, “Revise faulty construction” (King, Draft of chapter 4).  King did not correct the error. 453 </p><div id="pagenum"><p>The Martin Luther King, Jr. Papers Project </p></div><div id="pagenum"><p>15 Apr </p></div><p id="page">1955 acquired. These new meanings integrated with the old both deepen and en-  rich the thoughts and feelings of the individual. Wieman emphasizes the point  that this integration does not occur in every case of communicated meaning,  since there is much noncreative communication in our modern world by way  of radio, newspapers, and casual interchange between individuals.” “The  mere passage through the mind of innumerable meanings,” says Wieman, “is  not the creative event.”” Before the creative event can occur the newly com-  municated meanings must be integrated with meanings previously acquired.  To make sure that this integrating is not the work of the individual, Wie-  man contends that it is largely subconscious, unplanned and uncontrolled  by the individual, save only as he may provide conditions favorable to its  occurrence. l3  The supreme achievement of this second subevent seems to occur in soli-  tude, sometimes quite prolonged. After the many meanings have been ac-  quired through communication, there must be time for them to be assimi-  lated. If one does not for a time withdraw himself from the material world  and cease to communicate with others, the constant stream of new meanings  will prevent the deeper integrati~n.’~ “A period of loneliness and quiet pro-  vides for incubation and creative transformation by novel unification. If new  meanings are coming in all the time, the integration is hindered by the new  impressions. t  Examples of creative integration in solitude are Jesus in the wilderness of  temptation and in Gethsemene, Buddha alone under the Bo tree, Paul in the  desert on the way to Damascus, and Augustine at the time of his conversion.  It seems that the individuals through whom the creative event has done most  to transform and enrich the world with meaning have spent more time in  lonely struggles.15  * Wieman, SHG, 50.~2  t Wieman, SHG, 60.  11.

If one does not for a time draw apart and cease to  act on the material world and communicate with others, the constant stream of new meanings  will prevent the deeper integration.”  15.

This intercommunication  took place with such depth and potency that the organization of the disciples’  personalities were broken down and they were remade.29 “They became new  men, and the thoughts and feelings of each got across to the other. . . . There  arose in this group of disciples a miraculous awareness and responsiveness  toward the needs and interests of one another.*  But this intercommunication was not all; something else followed.

It is a structure whereby some events derive from other  events, through meaningful connection with them, and abundance of quality  that events could not have had without this connection.§ 27 15 Apr  1955  * Wieman, SHG, 39,40.  t Wieman, SHG, 40.  $ Wieman, SHG, 41.  0 Wieman, SHG, 65.  23.

God as growth  In his earlier works Wieman sought to define the nature of God under the  God is the growth of meaning and value in the world. This growth consists of  increase in those connections between activities which make the activities mutu-  ally sustaining, mutually enhancing, and mutually meaningful.* concept of growth. He says:  He goes on to affirm that “growth is creative synthesis. It is the union of  diverse elements in such a way that the new relation transforms them into a  whole that is very different from the mere sum of the original factors.”t  Chemical elements unite in this way. Flowers grow by absorbing such elements  as sunshine, air, water, and minerals, however, these are transformed in the  new synthesis so that the original elements are no longer recognizable. The  human mind grows by absorbing ideas and sentiments from the social envi-  ronment, which are in turn transformed in the new synthesis. The culture of  a community grows by absorbing the ideas, techniques, sentiments of the past  and adding to these the newer developments of the present, but the gifts from  the past and the present transform one another into a new kind of whole.$28  This is what Wieman means by growth.  Wieman makes it clear that this process of growth is not evolution as science  uses the term. Growth is only one form of evolution. Much of the decompo-  sition, conflict, and mutual destruction going on throughout nature science  would call evolution. But through it all we also find the formation of connec-  tions of mutual support, mutual control, and mutual fulfillment between di-  verse activities forming new systems in which each part supports the whole  and the whole operated to conserve the parts.§ 29 This is growth.  * Wieman, NPOR, 137. “experience” in Dewey’s $ Wieman, GOR, 325,  Wieman’s definition of familiar use of the word. 326.

It is a  structure whereby some events derive from other events, through meaningful connection with  them, an abundance of quality that events could not have had without this new creation.”  28.

A flower grows by absorbing such elements as sunshine, air, water,  and minerals, but these are transformed in the new synthesis so that the orginial elements are no  longer recognizable.

He is the creative synthesis at work in the  immediate concrete situation. In both cases God is that something that brings  about a new structure of interrelatedness whereby events are related in a  manner not possible before. 15 Apr  1955  iii. God as supra-human  One of the persistent notes that runs the whole gamut of Wieman’s writing  is the affirmation that God is supra-human. Wieman is adverse to anything  that smacks of humanism. His emphasis is theocentric through and through.  He never wearies of pointing out that it is not the intelligence and purpose  of man that is responsible for the creation and increase of good. “God,” he  contends, “is that which sustains, promotes and constitutes the greatest good,  operating with men and in men, but also over and above the conscious and  intelligent purpose of men.”* Again he says:  When men try to construct an order of good and superimpose it upon existence,  they will fail. But when they seek out in existence the growing good with all its  possibilities, near and remote, so far as they can, and minister to it with every  ability, love it, give their lives to it, their living will be effective. But when they  do this they are depending upon God, living for God and with God.?  Still again Wieman writes:  We feel there is no more dangerous misinterpretation of religious experience  than to represent it as “subjective.” Our whole point has been to show that it is  an experience of something not ourselves.$  Wieman is convinced that the chief tragedies that befall man and his his-  toric existence stem from man’s tendency to elevate created good to the rank  of creative good (God). The best in Christianity, contends Wieman, is the re-  versing of the order of domination in the life of man from domination of  human concern by created good over to domination by creative good (God).p0  * Wieman, Art.

Much of this would be called  evolution by science. But through it all we also find the formation of connections of mutual  support, mutual control, and mutual fulfillment between diverse activities forming new systems  in which each part supports the whole and the whole operates to conserve the parts.”  30. Wieman, Source of Human Good, pp. 268-269: “The best in Christianity . . . is revelation  of God, forgiveness of sin, and salvation of man. . . . These three are different strands woven 459 </p><div id="pagenum"><p>The Martin Luther King, Jr. Papers Project </p></div><div id="pagenum"><p>15 APr </p></div><p id="page">’955 (1) God and man  Wieman’s aversion to humanism is clearly expressed in his affirmation that  the work of God is totally different from the work of man. The difference is  not merely of degree or magnitude. It is a difference of kind.31 For Wieman  there is a qualitative difference between God and man.  Wieman contends that the work of God is the growth of organism, while  the work of man is the construction of mechanism.32 In setting forth an ex-  ample of this distinction, Wieman says:  God rears a tree by growth of organic connections. Man constructs a house by  putting the parts together mechanically. Man can choose the place for the tree  to grow. But the actual growing he cannot do.*  The same applies to all growth, of flowers, friendships, cultures, self-devel-  opment, and meanings.  Wieman looks upon mechanisms and organisms as two different kinds of  systems which enter into the existence of almost e~erything.~~ “A mechanism  is a system of external relations. An organism is a system of internal relations  or, as I prefer to say, of organic connection.”t Internal relations are creative.  Therefore, when things are internally related, they undergo transformation  and mutually control one another. All through the world is found organism,  that is, systems of internal relations. But we also find mechanism. Organism  cannot develop without mechanism to support it.  God’s work is the growth of organic connections, that is, “the growth of  meaning and value.” This is not and can never be the work of man. However,  * Wieman, Art. (1g32)~, 441.”  t Wieman, Art. (1936)2, 442.  together into a single complex event, the character of which can be simply stated: the reversing  of the order of domination in the life of man from domination of human concern by created good  over to domination by creative good.”  31. Henry Nelson Wieman, “God Is More than We Can Think,” Christendom I (1936): 441:  “Man’s work can be clearly distinguished from that of God. . . . The difference is not merely a  matter of magnitude and power. It is a difference in kind.”  32. Wieman, “God Is More,” p. 441: “The work of God, which man never does, is the growth  of organism. The work of man is the construction of mechanism.”  33. The correct citation should read Wieman, Art. (1936)~, 441. There are two additional  sentences in the original before “Man can choose the place for the tree to grow” (Wieman, “God  Is More,” p. 441).  34. Wieman, “God Is More,” pp. 441-442: “The same applies to all growth, to growth of  flowers, friendships, cultures, self-development, meanings.

But it is only God that produces a structure which  could not be intended by the human mind before it emerges, either in imagi-  nation or in the order of actual events. The structure of value produced by  the creative event (God) cannot be caused by human intention and effort,  because it can by produced only by a transformation of human intention and  effort.*37  So God is superhuman because he operates without the conscious intent  of man. God is superhuman, furthermore, because he generates personality.  Wieman seeks to explain how this takes place. He begins with the theory  of social psychology that personality can exist only in society. Personality is  something that develops only when there is some interaction between individ-  uals. Therefore, human personality does not create this kind of interaction.  Rather this interaction creates pers~nality.~~ This interaction is the God of the  universe.?  Even God’s purpose is different from purpose as found in man. Wieman  writes: 15 Apr  1955  But we must understand purpose in two different senses. First, the kind of pur-  pose which we see in minds, namely, the purpose involved in constructing mech-  anisms.

Rather this interaction creates personality.” 46 1 </p><div id="pagenum"><p>The Martin Luther King, Jr. Papers Project </p></div><div id="pagenum"><p>‘5 Apr </p></div><p id="page">‘955 volved in generating and promoting the growth of organic connections directly.  This last we call simply by the name of growth.*  In an even more emphatic passage, Wieman declares:  God, I have come to see with increasing clarity, is not merely man lifted to the  nth dimension of perfection, any more than he is horse or any other animal so  glorified. God is different from man. God works concretely. Man cannot possibly  do that. Man must work abstractly . . . That is to say, man’s plans, his ideals, his  purposes, are necessarily abstractions by reason of the very nature of the human  mind. God alone is concrete in his workings. God is creator. Man cannot be  creator. The production of unpredictable consequences through the forming of  “internal relations” is creation. A common word for it is growth. It is God’s work-  ing not mankt  These rather lengthy passages are rich in ideas. They express in no uncertain  terms Wieman’s strong conviction that there is a qualitative difference be-  tween God and man. God operates in ways over and above the plans and  purposes of man, and often develops connections of mutual support and mu-  tual meaning in spite of, or contrary to, the efforts of men.  In stressing the fact that God is supra-human, Wieman does not mean that  God works outside of human life. Rather he means that God creates the good  of the world in a way that man can never do. Man cannot even approximate  the work of the creative event.$39  (2) God not supernatural  Wieman’s persistent affirmation that God is supra-human might easily give  the impression that he also holds that God is supernatural. But nothing is  farther from Wieman’s intention. He is as opposed to supernaturalism as he  is to humanism. Both humanism and supernaturalism fail to get at the true  nature of the universe.  As we have seen, Wieman’s position is naturalistic. This means that he sees  nothing in reality accessible to the human mind more basic than events and  their qualities and re1ati0ns.S~~ The basic things in the world are events, hap-  * Wieman, Art.

Wieman, Source of Human Good, p. 76: “The creative event is supra-human, not in the  sense that it works outside of human life, but in the sense that it creates the good of the world in  a way that man cannot do. Man cannot even approximate the work of the creative event.”  40. Wieman, Source of Human Good, p. 6: “There is nothing in reality accessible to the human  mind more basic than events and their qualities and relations. (‘Relations’ is another word for  ‘structure.’)” 462 </p><div id="pagenum"><p>The Martin Luther King, Jr. Papers Project </p></div><div id="pagenum"><p>penings, or processes. They are the “stuff” or substance of experience. There </p></div><p id="page">is nothing more fundamental or elemental than events. There is nothing tran-  scending or undergirding events. Events do not happen to something which  or someone who is not an event. Everything that exists is either an event, an  aspect of an event, or a relation between or within events. Therefore, Wie-  man’s naturalistic philosophy is opposed to substance philosophy. All philo-  sophical categories are descriptive of events, and events of various kinds are  the primary data for all inquiry.*  Wieman’s naturalistic position also leads him to affirm that all things are  “somewhere,” and “somewhere” refers to events. There are no events without  structures, and there are no structures or forms existing or subsisting apart  from events.? There is no disembodied or nonincarnate order as Logos.  This principle also means that the world of our experience is self-explana-  tory. There are no floating transcendental principles which explain the world  in terms of something outside the world. As we shall see subsequently, Wie-  man totally denies the traditional doctrine of creation. Principles, descriptions,  and explanations refer to events and their relations (structures). Therefore,  the ultimate in explanation is simply the most general concrete description  possible.$  Wieman is quite emphatic on the point that the limits of knowledge are  defined by the limits of the experienceable, and the limits of the experience-  able are defined by the limits of relationships. What we are not related to we  cannot experience. What is unrelated to us is unknowable, and the unknow-  able is unknown. “Nature” comprises the experienceable. Therefore, in this  case by definition, a purely transcendental or noumenal realm is regarded as  unknown and superfluous. Everything that exists has the power either to af-  fect other things or to be affected by them.§  All of this leads to the principle that God must be found within the natural  order. Like everything else that exists, God is a material being, a process with  an enduring structure which distinguishes his character from that of other  processes. Whatever may be his several other attributes, his transcendence is  not of the noumenal or completely independent variety. Whatever transcen-  dence he has will be seen to arise out of his very immanence in the world of  events. I I  Wieman contends further that God is directly experienceable, and experi-  enceable in the same basic way that other processes are directly perceivable.  Contrary to most schools of thought, Wieman holds that the God he is talking  about is observable, and observable in a fundamentally physical manner.  From this point of view the meaning of “revelation” is to be understood as a  disclosure of one process to another resulting from their relationship or con-  frontation. So all theology is natural theology for Wieman.  Although God is not supernatural for Wieman, he insists that God is hid-  den. God’s hiddenness derives from three factors: (a) man’s sin makes him 15 Apr  1955  * Wieman, SHG, 6. 8 Wieman is following fected by past events and  t Whitehead calls this the Whitehead at this point. then, subsequently, affects  $ Wieman, SHG, 7. ery event is first of all af- 11 Wieman, SHG, 33, 35. “ontological principle.” In Whitehead’s system, ev- other future events. 463 </p><div id="pagenum"><p>The Martin Luther King, Jr. Papers Project </p></div><div id="pagenum"><p>15 Apr </p></div><p id="page">1955 blind to that upon which he is most dependent; (b) God’s inexhaustible rich-  ness of creative power and goodness is such that man’s appreciative awareness  is only dimly alive to the creative and dynamic depth that confronts him; (3)  man’s consciousness appears to be such that it does not easily perceive those  elements of our experience which are always present. We more easily observe  those factors which are sometimes absent. Thus it is exceedingly difficult to  analyze and describe what we mean by “time.” At a deeper level it is still more  difficult to perceive God because it is by the working of that very process in  us that our minds are recreated.  However, in spite of God’s “hiddenness,” Wieman insists that God’s stan-  dard of value is compatible with ours. So when Wieman says that God is the  creative source of all value, he means that the source of all value must have a  structure or character that is compatible with, or supportive of, the structure  which characterizes values in general. The notion that God is the “wholly  other” needs to be qualified by this general consideration.  So for Wieman, nature includes all that is knowable, actually or potentially,  by normal processes of knowing. Nature includes mind, personality, and  value. According to this view, the “supernatural” is the semantically meaning-  less. Wieman sees the idea of the “supernatural” as not only unnecessary to  religion but confusing and frustrating in any genuine attempt to achieve ad-  justment to the word of God in the world.  So Wieman would answer the question, Where is God found? by saying that  God is within the cosmic whole. He is one aspect of it. He is here in nature,  present, potent, and widely operative. Wieman says further that God is not  the pervading purpose of the cosmic whole, as Protestant liberalism would  say. God is not to be identified with the cosmic whole in any way. Neither is  he the creator of the cosmic whole as the supernaturalists say. God is found  in nature all about us; he must be known by the same cognitive procedure by  which other realities in nature are known.  (3) The functional transcendence of God  Wieman’s naturalistic position leads him to the conclusion that nothing can  make the slightest difference in our lives unless it be an event or some pos-  sibility carried by an event. This means that that which is considered meta-  physically transcendent literally has nothing to do, since all value, all meaning,  and all causal efficacy are to be found in the world of events and their pos-  sibilities. So Wieman finds it necessary to deny the metaphysical transcedn-  ence of God as set forth by traditional Christianity. But there is a sense in  which God is transcendent, viz., functionally. Concerning Gods transcen-  dence Wieman says:  Since creativity is not readily accessible to awareness, we can speak of creativity as  transcendent. But it is not transcendent in the sense of being nontemporal, non-  spatial, and immaterial. It can be discovered in the world by proper analysis.*  464 * Wiernan, SHG, 77. </p><div id="pagenum"><p>The Martin Luther King, Jr. Papers Project </p></div><div id="pagenum"><p>Although Wieman rejects the metaphysical transcendence of God, he is </p></div><p id="page">quite certain that God’s functional transcendence serves all of the vital and  saving functions performed by the “myth” of a metaphysically transcendental  reality.41 He lists six saving functions of the metaphysical myth of transcen-  dence and seeks to demonstrate how a functionally transcendent God meets  all these conditions.  The six saving functions of the “metaphysical myth of supernaturalism” are  as follows: (1) The Christian myth has directed the absolute commitment of  faith away from all created good and thus delivered man from bondage to  any relative value. (2) It has established a demand for righteousness far be-  yond the socially accepted standards of a given time and place. (3) It has es-  tablished a bond between men vastly deeper and more important than per-  sonal affection, mutual interest, and racial identity. (4) It has revealed that evil  is deeper than any wrong done to society, or to any person, because in the last  analysis evil is against the transcendental reality. (5) It has revealed any obli-  gation laid upon man which overrides an obligation derived from society, tra-  dition, ideal, or loyalty to persons. (6) It has opened the possibility for cre-  ative transformation beyond anything that could be accomplished by human  God as creative event fulfills every one of these functions. However, the  creative event (God) cannot accomplish these services unless men by faith give  themselves to its control and transforming Wieman also contends  that God is functionally transcendent in the sense that he is the uncompre-  hended totality of all that is best. “God is both immanent and transcendent.  Consider first the transcendence, meaning by transcendence not necessarily  what is far away but what is too loftily good to be comprehended by us.”? 15 Apr  1955  * Wieman, SHG, 264, 265.  t Wieman, Art.

What else can be inferred from the  following passages?  We are inert and unresponsive to the specific forms of God’s presence. We  cannot know save to an infinitesimal degree, these specific forms. But we can  know that the reality is there, even when the specific forms of that reality are  unknown.?  But the fullness of God’s being, and the richness of value in God, are immeas-  urable beyond the weak little fluttering attempts of human imagination to  comprehend.$  Here Wieman is saying that God can never be known in his fullness and rich-  ness. In this sense God is transcendent. He is more than we can think.  iv. God as absolute good  Wieman contends that creative good (God) is the only absolute good. He  seeks to defend this claim by defining absolute in a fivefold sense. First of all,  absolute good refers to that which is good under all circumstances and con-  ditions. It is a good that is not relative to time or place or race or class or need  or desire. It is good that remains changelessly and identically the same. It is  good that remains even if it runs counter to human desire. It is a good that  continues to be identically the same good even when it works with microscopic  cells prior to the emergence of any higher organism.44  Creative good meets all these requirements. Its goodness is not relative to  time or place or desire or even human existence.45 It is good that would con-  tinue even if human existence ceased to be.  * Wieman, Art.

This passage can never know certain be known.  seems to contradict Wie-  man’s assertion that God is $ Wieman, Art. (i937), aspects of God.  44. Wieman, Source of Human Good, p. 79: “When we speak of ‘absolute good’ we shall mean,  first of all, what is good under all conditions and circumstances. It is a good that is not relative to  time or place or person or race or class or need or hope or desire or belief. It is a good that  remains changelessly and identically the same. . . . It is a good that retains its character even when  it runs counter to all human desire. It is good that continues to be identically the same good even  when it works with microscopic cells prior to the emergence of any higher organism.”  45. Wieman, Source of Human Good, p. 79: “Creative good meets all these requirements per-  taining to absolute good. Its goodness is not relative to human desire, or even to human  existence.” 466 </p><div id="pagenum"><p>The Martin Luther King, Jr. Papers Project </p></div><div id="pagenum"><p>This is what distinguished God’s goodness from all types of created good. </p></div><p id="page">Created good is relative in all the senses that stand in contrast to the absolute  as just described. Created good does not retain the same character of good-  ness under all circumstances and conditions. The creative good, however,  does retain its character of goodness under all circumstances and is therefore  the only absolute good.*46  A second mark of absolute good is that its demands are unlimited. A good  is absolute if it is always good to give oneself, all that one is, possesses, and  desires into its control to be transformed in any way that it may require.47  Creative good is absolute in this sense because it demands wholehearted  surrender.?  A third mark of absolute good is its infinite value. This mark is somewhat  inseparable from the second. Absolute good is unlimited in its demands be-  cause it is infinite in val~e.~8  Its worth is incommensurable by any finite quantity of created good. No additive  sum of good produced in the past can be any compensation for the blockage of  that creativity which is our only hope for the future.$ 15 Apr  1955  Fourth, absolute good is unqualified good. There must be no perspective  from which its goodness can be modified.

Wieman, Source of Human Good, pp. 79-80: “On the other hand, created good-the struc-  ture of meaning connecting past and future that we feel and appreciate-is relative value in all  the senses that stand in contrast to the absolute as just described. . . . Thus created good does not  retain the same character of goodness under all circumstances and conditions. . . . The creative  good which does retain its character of goodness under all these changing conditions is, then, the  only absolute good.”  47. Wieman, Source of Human Good, p. 80: “A second mark of absolute good is that its demands  are unlimited. A good is absolute if it is always good to give myself, all that I am and all that I  desire, all that I possess and all that is dear to me, into its control to be transformed in any way  that it may require.”  48. Wieman, Source of Human Good, p. 80: “Thus in a third way, inseparable from the second,  creative good is absolute. It is unlimited in its demands because it is infinite in value.”  49. Wieman, Source of Human Good, pp. 80-81: “Fourth, absolute good is unqualified good.  There must be no perspective from which its goodness can be modified in any way. Always, from  every standpoint, its good must remain unchanged and self-identical, whether from the worm’s  view or the man’s view, whether under the aspect of eternity or under the aspect of time, . . .  whether viewed as means or as end.” 467 </p><div id="pagenum"><p>The Martin Luther King, Jr. Papers Project </p></div><div id="pagenum"><p>15 Apr </p></div><p id="page">1955 the best possible under the conditions, even when it may seem to be other-  wise.50 Concerning the trustworthiness of the creative event, Wieman says:  Even when it so transforms us and our world that we come to love what now we  hate, to serve what now we fight, to seek what now we shun, still we can be sure  that what it does is good. Even when its working re-creates our minds and per-  sonalities. we can trust it.*  Creative good will always be with us, even when other good is destroyed. So  in this dual sense creative good is absolutely trustworthy: it always produces  good; it never fails.t5’  Wieman makes it clear that his claim that God is absolute good does not  imply that absolute good means all powerful good. Such a view would conflict  with Wieman’s empiricistic position. He insists that the claim that any kind of  good is almighty cannot be defended.$52  We see here an emphasis in Wieman’s thought concerning God which is  found throughout his writings. Most thinkers are impressed with the power  of God. Wieman, on the contrary, is more impressed with the goodness of  God. His interest concerning God is axiological rather than ontological. The  ever-recurring words in Wieman’s concept of God are goodness and value.  He says: “I maintain . . . that the basic category for God must be goodness or  value.” 5  2. God and value  The one word that appears throughout Wieman’s discussion of God is the  word value. Indeed he defines God as “growth of living connections of value  in the universe,”II and as “the growth of meaning and value in the world.” He  feels that values are the “primary data for religious inquiry,” including inquiry  concerning God. So we can see that his theory of value is all-important for an  understanding of his conception of God. A summary of his value-theory is  thus in order at this point.  * Wieman, SHG, 81. 5 Wieman, Art. (1943)3,  t Wieman, SHG, 81. 267.  $ Wieman, SHG, 82. 11 Wieman, GOR, 363.  50. Wieman, Source of Human Good, p. 81: “Finally, creative good is absolute in that it is entirely  trustworthy. We can be sure that the outcome of its working will always be the best possible under  the conditions, even when it may seem to us to be otherwise.”  51. Wieman, Source of Human Good, p. 81: “We can also be sure that creative good will always  be with us. When all other good is destroyed, it springs anew; it will keep going when all else fails.  In this dual sense creative good is absolutely trustworthy: it always produces good; it never fails.”  52.

His refusal to separate values from nature is clearly in line with Dewey’s  position. And this refusal to make a sharp ontological distinction between the  realms of value and of fact leads him also to reject the preferential treatment  given to “ideals” in metaphysics by Brightman and other ethical idealists.$ If  one defies conceptual ideals, he says, then all concepts must share this status  indiscriminately, and the resulting chaos can only be overcome through a fur-  ther appeal to experience; ideals, in other words, are functional guides in the  interpretation of experience but are not “transcendental.”9 54  * Wieman, NPOR, 137.

We shall begin by glancing  at some of the value-theories that he rejects. Then we will turn to a discussion  of Wieman’s positive theory of value.  (1) Value theories rejected by Wieman  Wieman holds that any substantial theory of value must be based on some-  thing that transcends the subjective. He finds that most value-theories are  lacking at this very point. Thus he finds it necessary to reject most theories of  value. Most of these theories that Wieman rejects are quite familiar.  Emotion or feeling has been selected by some as giving the essence of value.  Also specific emotions like love, satisfaction, liking, pleasure and happiness  have been taken as guiding threads. But no amount of observation and analy-  sis and interrelating of subjective emotions, cut off from the personalities hav-  ing them and from the situation calling them forth, can be made to yield a  rational structure or principle helpful in solving the important practical prob-  lems of life. Emotions are certainly involved in all experiences. But one could  scarcely bring all values into the category of either of the above-mentioned  emotions.55  Love, for instance, is a very vague term. It must be analyzed into forms that  can give us some guidance. Satisfaction of desire, or liking, does enter into  any direct experience of value, but it is precisely when we mistrust our own  likings and satisfactions that we need and want a guiding theory. Happiness  has in it all the ambiguities of liking and sati~faction.~~  A second theory that Wieman rejects is the contention that intelligence is  the substance of all value. Such a contention seems to overlook the fact that  there are flagrant cases of evil intelligence. If it is admitted that evil is negative  value, that is the criterion which distinguishes the positive from the negative  value of intelligence.57  55. Henry Nelson Wieman, “Values: Primary Data for Religious Inquiry,” Journal of Religion  16, no. 4 (October 1936): 381: “Emotion, or that more general term, feeling, has been selected  by some as giving us the essence of value. Emotions and feelings are certainly involved in all  experiences of value. But no amount of observation and analysis and interrelating of feelings,  cut off from the personalities having them and from the situations calling them forth, can be  made to yield a rational structure or principle helpful in solving the important practical problems  of life. . . . Love is certainly one kind of value, but one could scarcely bring all values into this  category.”  56. Wieman, “Values,” p. 382: “Love is a very vague term. It must be analyzed into forms or  relations that can give us some guidance and light. . . . Satisfaction of desire, or liking, does enter  into any direct and appreciative experience of value. But is is precisely when we mistrust our own  likings and satisfactions that we need and want a guiding theory. . . . Happiness has in it all the  ambiguity of liking and satisfaction.”  57. Wieman, “Values,” p. 382: “Intelligence has sometimes been honored as the substance of  all value. . . . Apparently that is meant, and yet there seem to be flagrant cases of evil intelligence.  If one says evil is negative value, then what is the criterion which distinguishes the positive from  the negative value of intelligence?” 47O </p><div id="pagenum"><p>The Martin Luther King, Jr. Papers Project </p></div><div id="pagenum"><p>A third theory that Wieman rejects is the assertion that biological patterns, </p></div><p id="page">such as survival or adjustment or life, determine the mark of value. It is easy,  says Wieman, to find instances of evil that has survived and good that has  perished. The same general principle applies to adjustment and life. There is  good adjustment and bad, and good life and bad. Hence these terms give us  no guidance.58  A fourth theory that Wieman dismisses as false is the contention that per-  sonality is the distinctive mark of value. Sheer observation reveals that person-  alities are good and bad to the extreme. Hence it is not mere personality, but  something about personality which is the value.5g  A fifth theory that Wieman rejects is the assertion that the criterion of value  is found in patterns in the physical world, such as order and purpose. It is  true that value implies order of a kind. But what kind of order is better and  what kind worse? More order is not necessarily more value unless it is the  right kind of order. The same is true of purpose. Neither order nor purpose  in itself gives us a clear distinction between better and worse.6o  All of these theories are emphatically rejected by Wieman. They are not  rejected because they are alien to value, for he quite readily admits that all of  these elements enter into any experience of value. They are rejected as con-  structive theories of value. For such a theory one must go to something else. 15 Apr  1955  (2) Value as appreciable activity  Wieman thinks that the factor in value which lends itself most readily to a  guiding pattern by which to formulate a value theory is appreciable activity.  He is determined to base his theory of value on something that transcends the  shaky foundations of subjectivity. So it is in activity that he find something  objective. It can be observed, computed, foreseen. Activities can be connected  in meaningful and supporting ways.61  Since the words, activity and meaning, are of first importance in Wieman’s  58. Wieman, “Values,” p. 383: “Biological patterns have been said to be the determining mark  of value, such as survival or adjustment or life. But it is easy to find instances of evil that have  survived and good that has perished. . . . The same general principle applies to adjustment and  life. There is good adjustment and bad, and good life and bad. Hence these terms give us no  guidance at all.”  59. Wieman, “Values,” p. 383: “Personalities are good and bad to all extremes. Hence it is not  mere personality, but something about personality which is the value.”  60. Wieman, “Values,” p. 384: “Patterns in the physical world, such as order and purpose,  have been selected as criteria of value. Doubtless value implies order of a kind, but what kind of  order is better and what kind worse? More order is not necessarily more value unless it is the  right kind of order. The same is true of purpose. . . . At any rate, purpose of itself does not give  us a clear distinction between better and worse.”  61. Wieman, “Values,” p. 385: “We believe the factor in value which lends itself most readily  to a guiding pattern or principle by which to discover, appraise, and appreciate values is appre-  ciable activity. Activity is objective. It can be observed, computed, foreseen. . . . Activities can be  connected in meaningful and supporting ways.” 471 </p><div id="pagenum"><p>The Martin Luther King, Jr. Papers Project </p></div><div id="pagenum"><p>15 Apr </p></div><p id="page">1955 theory of value, we may profitably pursue their meaning. An activity is first  of all a change. But not all changes are activities. A change is an activity only  when it is so related to other changes that they mutually modify one another  in such a way as to meet the requirements of a system to which they belong.  For instance, many of the changes that transpire in a cell are so related to  many other changes of the physiological organism that they all mutually  modify one another to the end of meeting the requirements of the living  system. Or, again, gravitational changes mutually modify one another in such  a way as to meet the requirements of the gravitational system.*62  It is possible for a change to be an activity with respect to one system and  not in relation to another. As was stated above, gravitational changes are ac-  tivities with respect to the gravitational system, but they are not necessarily  activities with respect to the system of a living organism. Actually changes  which sustain one system may be destructive of others.63  Wieman stresses the fact that an activity is a value only when it is appre-  ciable. If it is not appreciable activity, it is not the datum in which value can  be “Activity may be a mechanical routine or a spasmodic impulse or  a dizzy whirl.” t To be appreciable means that some living consciousness may  be affected by it with joy or suffering. But this does not mean that the con-  sciousness must have some knowledge of this activity. Many activities qualify  consciousness without being objects of consciousness. Oxidation of the blood  in one’s lungs, for instance, qualifies one’s consciousness when one is not at all  conscious of what is going on. These changes pertain, however, if their re-  moval or Cessation would destroy the system which yields the experience of  ~a1ue.S~~  * Wieman, Art. (1936)4, 388.  t Wieman, Art. (1936)4, 386.  $ Wieman, Art. (1936)4, 387.  62. Wieman, “Values,” p. 387: “Since these two, activity and meaning, are of first importance  in our interpretation of value, we must try to make plain the idea we wish to express by each. An  activity is, first of all, a change. But it is not every change. A change is an activity when it is so  related to other changes that they mutually modify one another to the end of meeting the re-  quirements of a system to which they belong. For example, gravitational changes mutually modify  one another in such a way as to meet the requirements of the gravitational system. . . . Or, again,  many of the changes that transpire in a cell are so related to many other changes in the physio-  logical organism that they all mutually modify one another to the end of meeting the require-  ments of the living system.”  63. Wieman, “Values,” p. 388: “We have shown that gravitational changes are activities with  respect to the gravitational system. But they are not activities, necessarily, with respect to the  system of a living organism. . . . It is plain that a change may be an activity with respect to one  system and not in relation to another. . . . Changes which sustain one system are often destructive  of others.”  64. Wieman, “Values,” pp. 386, 388: “The activity must be appreciable. Otherwise it is not the  datum in which value can be found. . . . An activity is a value only when it is appreciable.”  65. Wieman, “Values,” pp. 388-389: “To be appreciable means that some living consciousness  sometime, somewhere, some way, may be affected by it with joy or suffering. This does not re- 472 </p><div id="pagenum"><p>The Martin Luther King, Jr. Papers Project </p></div><div id="pagenum"><p>With this explanation of activity let us now turn to a discussion of Wieman’s </p></div><p id="page">view of meaning. He affirms that activity and meaning are closely related but  not identical.66  One change means another change when the first represents the second to an  actual or possible experiencing mind. One change can mean another most effec-  tively if the two changes so connected that, when certain modification occur in  the one. certain other correlative modifications occur in the other.* 15 Apr  1955  So the connection between changes which makes them to be activities within  a system in a connection which is best fitted to make them carriers of meaning  by virtue of the fact that they can represent one another to a mind that un-  derstands the connection between them. A throbbing pulse, for instance,  means the presence of life to a mind that is able to understand the connection  between these throbs and that system of co-ordinated changes in the organism  which makes it a living thing. Rising smoke in the distance means the presence  of fire to the mind that understands the connection between smoky changes  in the atmosphere and correlative changes called combustion.t 67 This leads  Wieman to say:  Meaning is that connection between the here-and-now and the far-away which  enables a mind that understands the connection to experience the far-away  through the mediation of the here-and-now. This ability to transmit the far-away  to the experience of a mind by way of representation is what. we call meaning.  This ability depends on two things: (I) The right connections and (2) the mind’s  understanding of these connections.$  Wieman insists that meaning as set forth in his philosophy is not subjective.  The experience of the meaning is subjective, but the meaning which is expe-  * Wieman, Art. ( 1936)4, 389.  t Wieman, Art. (1936)4, 390.  $ Wieman, Art. (1936)~, 391.  quire that the consciousness have any knowledge of this activity. . . . They qualify consciousness  without being objects of consciousness. Oxidation of the blood in my lungs qualifies my conscious-  ness when I am not at all conscious of what is going on. These changes pertain to value, however,  if their removal or cessation would destroy the system which yields the experience of value.”  66. Wieman, “Values,” p. 389: “With this understanding of activity let us now turn to the  interpretation of meaning. Activity and meaning are closely related but not identical.”  67. Wieman, “Values,” pp. 389-390: “So we see that the connection between changes which  makes them to be activities within a system is a connection which is best fitted to make them  carriers of meaning by virtue of the fact that they can represent one another to a mind that  understands the connection between them. A throbbing pulse means the presence of life to a  mind that is able to understand the connection between these throbs and that system of co-  ordinated changes in the organism which makes it a living thing. Rising smoke in the distance  means the presence of fire to a mind that understands the connection between smoky changes in  the atmosphere and correlative changes called combustion.” 473 </p><div id="pagenum"><p>The Martin Luther King, Jr. Papers Project </p></div><div id="pagenum"><p>15 Apr </p></div><p id="page">1955 rienced, namely, the connection of mutual control or correlation between  changes is not subjective. It is true, moreover, that meaning is dependent on  understanding and appreciation which are themselves subjective, but that  which is understood and appreciated is no more subjective than a mountain  or a city.*6s Now that we have discussed Wieman’s “meaning of meaning” we  can move on to his contention that value is a kind of connection.  It was stated above that value is not enjoyment. Enjoyment is too subjective  to constitute the essence of value. What is enjoyable for one person may not  be for another. What one person enjoys at one time is something loathsome  to him under other conditions. But no matter how diverse may be the enjoy-  ments of different people, one thing seems plain.69 “The enjoyable activities,  utterly different thought they may be, can be had only when they are so con-  nected that they do not destroy one another.”t Therefore, when we have any  enjoyment, what we are actually experiencing is a great system of activities all  connected in such a way as to yield that sort of enjoyment.’O  Now since value is what makes an experience enjoyable, this analysis seems  to indicate that value consists of the way activities are connected with one  another.  All of this leads Wieman to the conclusion that value is not enjoyment, but  it is that connection between activities which makes them enjoyable. In mo-  ments when we experience enjoyment, it is not merely our enjoyment that we  enjoy; rather it is a certain connection between activities that we enjoy.71 Out  of this grows Wieman’s definition of value. He says:  Value is that connection between appreciable activities which makes them  mutually sustaining, mutually enhancing, mutually diversifying, and mutually  meaningful.$  * Wieman, Art.

Eating wholesome food is  more valuable than eating unwholesome food because it is an activity which  supports many other appreciable activities. The same is true of honesty over  against dishonesty, good music over against bad, and the like.75  The second principle of value is mutual enhancement. Wholesome food not  only supports other enjoyable activities, but it makes those others more ap-  preciable. Honesty not only supports but may enhance the value of many  other a~tivities.?~  Mutual diversification is a third characteristic of that connection between  activities which makes them appreciable and gives them value. “Activities  must be connected in such a way as to permit increase in their diversification  and number without permanently destroying their mutual support.”?

Wieman, “Values,” pp. 394-395: “There is a further reason for speaking of appreciable  rather than of enjoyed or even enjoyable connections. . . . Such terms as enjoyed, enjoyment, and  enjoyable may blind us to the fact that there are high austere values which can be experienced at  times only through great pain and suffering.”  73.

It  is the principle of mutual support, mutual enhancement, mutual diversifica-  tion, mutual meaning, and transformation of suffering into an experience  which is positively appreciated. This fivefold principle is the principle of  value, lifting it above the immediate subjective feeling of enjoyment. One ac-  tivity is better when it is more appreciable by virtue of its connection with  other activities. The connection is that of support, enhancement, diversifica-  tion, meaning, and transmutation.’g \  ii. God as supreme value  In one of his writings Wieman defines God as “that structure which sus-  tains, promotes and constitutes supreme value.”-$ This structure of supreme  value enters into existence, and it also extends far beyond existence into the  realm of possibility. The terrible magnitude of evil makes it plain that the  whole of existence is by no means conformant to this structure of God.8o  * Wieman, Art. (1936)~, 396.  t Wieman, Art.

God is not merely the possibility of highest value, but he is actu-  ality which carries those possibilities.** “He is present, potent, operative, exist-  ing actuality.”)[ In this claim Wieman is seeking to refute outright the theory  that the most important reality which can concern human life is not anything  that exists, but rather some non-existent possibility. Wieman emphatically  states:  When we cut off the possibility from the process which makes it a possibility, and  prize the possibility as more important than the process that carries it, we are  assuming a self-defeating and self-contradictory attitude . . . To say that the  process is mere means and therefore of less value than the possibility which is  the end, is to set up a wholly vicious dichotomy between means and ends. The  highest possibilities of value can never be attained except by way of process  which leads to them.#  Again he writes:  God is not merely possibility to be achieved. That is the ideal. But God is that  order of existence and possibility by virtue of which the greatest possible good is  truly a possibility and can be achieved by human effort.**  * Wieman, Art.

Such men  as R. B. Perry, Bertrand Russell, Herman Randall, and George Santayana  have affirmed that if men are to be faithful to the best, they must not supinely  yield to the vulgarity of existence, either actual or possible, but must give their  highest devotion to that nonexistent impossibility that never can be. But for  one to adore the impossible, affirms Wieman, implies that his adoring of it is  of great value. This adoring is itself a process of existence because he who  adores is an existing personality. Therefore, if the value be a value, even when  impossible of existence, that process of existence which enables one to value  it as such, cannot be ignored or excluded from the high esteem we give to the  impossibility of itself. Thus, some process of existence must be combined with  some possibility (or impossibility) to make up the object of one’s supreme de-  votion.* Since God is the name given to such an object, God must be identified  with that process of existence which carries the possibilities of greatest value.83  Now we can see that, for Wieman, supreme value is always a combination  of actuality and possibility. When these two are combined we have what is  called growth. Growth is a kind of change which increases what is, so as to  approximate what might be.  From this Wieman is led to affirm that supreme value is growth of meaning  in the world. Why is this growth supreme value? It is supreme value for the  following reasons: 84  (1) In it the greatest value that can ever be experienced at any time is always  to be found.  (2) It carries the highest possibilities of value, possibilities reaching far be-  yond the specific meanings we now know.  (3) All increase of value is found in it.  * Wieman, Art. (1931).  ’59.  83. Wieman, “God and Value,” pp. 158-159: “Some hold that the best is not a possibility at  all, but an impossibility. Therefore, if we are to be faithful to the best, we must not supinely yield  to the vulgarity of existence, either actual or possible, but must give our highest devotion to that  non-existent impossibility that never can be. R. B. Perry, Bertrand Russell, Herman Randall,  Joseph Wood Krutch, George Santayana, . . . have been eloquent on this point. But he who adores  the impossible, implies that his adoring of it is of great value. . . . But this adoring is itself a  process of existence because he who adores is an existing personality. . . . Second, if the value be  a value even when impossible of existence, then that process of existence which enables us to  value it as such, cannot be ignored or excluded from the high esteem we give to the impossibility  itself. Thus in any case some process of existence must be combined with some possibility (or  impossibility) to make up the object of our supreme devotion. Since God is the name we give to  such an object, God must be identified with that process of existence which carries the possibilities  of greatest value.”  84.

(2) It creates and sustains human personality.  (3) It carries human personality to whatsoever highest fulfillments are pos-  sible to it.  (4) It has more worth than personality, hence human personality finds its  highest destiny in giving itself to this growth to be mastered, used, and  transformed by it into the fabric of emerging values.  (5) The greatest value can be poured into human life only as we yield our-  selves to the domination and control of this growth. When we try to  dominate and use it, we lose these values.?  All of this gives weight to Wieman’s basic contention that God is the su-  preme value of the universe. He is certain that God is that order of structures  of value, actual and possible, which will ultimately issue in the realization of  the greatest value when we rightly conform to its requirements.SE6  (2) God as the unlimited growth of the  connection of value  One of the main bases of Wieman’s interpretation of God as supreme value  is God’s work as the unlimited growth of the connection of value. Every spe-  cific system of value is definitely limited, whether it be a living organism or a  society of organisms, or a community of minds with the institutional structure  called a culture. Each of these must perish. They are capable of carrying the  growth of connections of value only to a certain limit, and then must stop. In  order for values and meanings to grow indefinitely, it is necessary for each  of these limited systems of value to pass away in time and give place to some  * Wieman, NPOR, 50. $ Wieman, IOL, 221,  52. t Wieman, NPOR, 5 1, 222.  85.

God is the growth which has no  limit.  God is the growth which goes on through the successions of these limited systems  of value. God is the growth which exfoliates in all manner of value . . . God is  the growth which springs anew when old forms perish. When one organism dies,  others spring up. When one society perishes, others arise. When one epoch of  culture declines, others in time come forth. This unlimited growth of connec-  tions is God.*  iii. God as creative source of value  Wieman defines God not only in terms of the maximum achievement of  value, analogous to an ideal of perfection, but also in terms of those natural  conditions which underlie the achievement of value. God, in other words, is  not simply the greatest possible value or the process by which such value is  achieved; he is also the sum-total of all the natural conditions of such value-  achievement. Thus in a very interesting article Wieman says that “the value  of God . . . is that of creative source . . . that particular sort which pertains to  creator of all created values. The value of god is the value of creativity.”tss  Again he says:  The value of God is the value not of the gifts but of the giver. Not the goal but  the source, not the golden eggs but the goose that lays them, not the grains and  fruit but the creative earth, not the products of love but the loving, not beauty  but the generator of beauty, not truth but the source of truth, not moral righ-  teousness but the creator and transformer of righteousness, not the profits of  industry but the ultimate producer, not the goods but the creativity, must be  given priority over all else if we would escape destruction, have salvation, and  know the true and living God.$  * Wieman, Art.

Every specific system of  activities having value is definitely limited, whether it be a living organism with its sustaining  environment, or a society of organisms, or a community of minds with all their meanings and  with a historic development and institutional structure called a culture. Each of these must  perish. . . . If values and meanings are to grow indefinitely, each of these limited systems of value  must pass away in time and give place to some other order of existence and value.”  88. Martin, Empirical Philosophies of Religion, p. 104: “But we have noted that Wieman defines  God not simply in terms of the maximum achievement of value, analagous to an ideal of perfec-  tion, but also in terms of those natural conditions which underlie the achievement of value. God,  in other words, in not simply the greatest possible value or the process by which such value is  achieved; he is also the sum-total of all the natural conditions of such value-achievement.

Now it must be emphasized that when Wieman uses the term “create” he  does not mean what traditional Christianity means by the term. Historically  creation first referred to the act whereby the underived self-existent God  brought into being what had no form of independent existence hitherto. This  Christian notion contrasted radically with the Greek concept of “creation” as  an “informing” or reshaping of pre-existent entity. So strong was the Chris-  tian, theistic belief in an absolute, transcendent God who worked under no  external limitations, that creation was said to be ex nihilo, i.e. generation out  of nothing. With this concept, however, Wieman is in total disagreement. He  contends that the doctrine of creation ex nihilo is self-contradictory. More-  over, it would be impossible for Wieman on the basis of his method to get any  knowledge of such an initial generation, supposing it ever occurred. By “cre-  ate” Wieman means to produce what never was before, either in existence or  in the imagination of man, to produce that which exposes to appreciative  awareness more of the qualities of reality, or builds in that direction.*8g  Another point that Wieman emphasizes is that God as creative source is not  “the source of everything”. He is only “the generative source of all other  value.” Wieman writes:  God is not the creator, meaning the mysterious source of everything; he is only  the source of the good, or rather is himself the good. The source of all good is  simply the cosmic growing roots of all good, and these roots are themselves  good.? 15 Apr  1955  It is clear that Wieman is seeking to avoid pantheism by identifying God with  only the good in the universe. Wieman is emphatic in affirming that “all is not  God and God is not all. All is not good and good is not all.” There are many  disintegrating processes at work. There is death, futility and ruin. There is  evil in the world vast and devastating. These facts Wieman never overlooks.  What he is anxious to make plain is that there is also good, and that this good  is derived from the process of integrati~n.~~ “It is derived from God, the in-  tegrating behavior of the universe.”$  * Wieman, DIH, 61.  t Wieman, COR, 267.  $ Wieman, MPRL, 58.  a recent article he says that ‘the value of God . . . is that of creative source . . . that peculiar sort  which pertains to the creator of all created values.

God is not only supreme fulfillment or ideal perfection, but also  creative source of value. This does not mean that God creates and sustains the  universe as a whole. As we shall see in the discussion of “God and evil,” such  an assumption generates the “false problem” of evil. It is a flagrant contradic-  tion to affirm the goodness of God’s unlimited power in the face of the evil in  the world of which he is creator.* So in order to escape this contradiction  Wieman denies that God is author of the universe. Instead of being the crea-  tor and sustainer of the universe, God is the creator and sustainer of all that  is good in the universe. Such a creator and sustainer is not of the universe as  a whole, but only of the good that is in it.g1  We may ask at this point whether it is justifiable for Wieman, on the basis  of his empirical point of view, to speak of a creative source of value. If he  means to refer to the natural conditions or forces which underlie value  achievement, than it must be pointed out that empirically there is a plurality  of such conditions, and the notion of a “creative source” is at best figurative  and imaginative.  It is interesting to note that Dewey has discovered the same ambiguity in  Wieman’s concept of God.92 Dewey grants “that there are in existence condi-  tions and forces which, apart from human desire and intent, bring about en-  joyed and enjoyable goods, and that the security and extension of goods are  promoted by attention to and service of these conditions.”? But these condi-  tions and forces, contends Dewey, do not have enough unity to constitute a  unitary object of devotion and so cannot be considered God. So Dewey con-  cludes that Wieman reaches his view of God through the hypostatization of  * Wieman, GOR, 353,  354.  t Dewey, Rev. (1933)~  196.  all. All is not good and good is not all. . . .

Wieman and Horton, Growth of Relipon, pp. 353-354: “The assumption which generates  the false problem of evil is this: A perfectly good God creates and sustains the universe and all  that is in it. . . . The contradiction is between the goodness of God’s unlimited power and the evil  in the world of which he is creator and sustainer. . . . One who denies that God is the creator and  sustainer of the universe, simply does not have the contradiction on his hands. . . . There is a  creator and sustainer of all that is good in the universe. . . . Such a creator and sustainer, however,  is not of the universe as a whole, but only of the good that is in it.”  92. Martin, Empirical Philosophies ofRelzgzon, pp. 104- 105: “If he means to refer to the natural  conditions which may be utilized in the achievement of value, then once again we must point out  that empirically there is a plurality of such conditions, and the notion of ‘a’ creative ‘source’ is at  most imaginative and figurative. . . . It is interesting to note, in this connection, that Dewey has  pointed to some of these ambiguities in objecting to Wieman’s claim that his idea of God is a  faithful theistic formulation of the religious faith implicit in Dewey’s philosophy.” 482 </p><div id="pagenum"><p>The Martin Luther King, Jr. Papers Project </p></div><div id="pagenum"><p>an undeniable fact, experience of things, persons, causes, found to be good </p></div><p id="page">and worth cherishings, into a single objective existence, a  From a more consistent empirical point of view, Dewey’s criticisms seem  justified; indeed he has pointed out a difficulty that appears over and over  again in Wieman’s whole system. When Wieman speaks of God there seem to  be at least three different meanings. When he characterizes God as “supreme  value” he seems to mean the ideal of perfection or of the achievement of  maximum value. When he speaks of God as the “the unlimited connective  growth of value-connections’’ he seems to mean the human and social pro-  cesses which aim at the achievement of value. When he described God as the  process of progressive integration and as the creative event he seems to mean  the natural forces underlying the achievement of value. Certainly these three  meanings cannot be viewed as constituting a unity except in a highly figurative  and imaginative sense, and positively not for a religious philosophy which  would be consistently empirical. We must conclude that at this point Wieman  has failed to be consistently empirical.94 15 Apr  ‘955  3. God and evil  Wieman holds that from a consistently empirical point of view the problem  of evil, which has troubled so many thinkers, is a false problem. It arises only  when one departs from the empirical evidence for God as “the good” or the  chief factor for good in nature, and begins to speculate about God as some-  how being the creator and sustainer of the universe. As we have seen, Wieman  totally denies the view that God is creator of the universe. God is only the  creator and sustainer of the good in the universe, namely the power of  * Dewey, Rev.

Martin, Empirical Philosophies of Religzon, p. 105: “Now it seems to us that, from a more  consistently empirical point of view, Dewey’s criticisms are justified; indeed, it seems that he has  pointed clearly to the chief sources of difficulty in Wieman’s total view. When Wieman speaks of  God there seem to be at least three different meanings. He seems to mean the ideal of perfection  or of the achievement of maximum value; the human and social processes which aim at the  achievement of value; and the natural forces underlying or utilized in these processes. He does  not realize that these three meanings may be viewed as constituting a unity (or a Trinity!) only in  a highly imaginative and figurative sense, a sense appropriate to the life of faith and devotion,  perhaps, but not to a religious philosophy which would be consistently empirical in this connec-  tion. We believe that it is his failure to be consistently empirical in this connection which is largely  responsible for the confusions which we have found in his views of religious perception and  method.” 483 </p><div id="pagenum"><p>The Martin Luther King, Jr. Papers Project </p></div><div id="pagenum"><p>15 Apr </p></div><p id="page">1955 growth. Wieman feels that one must either deny the reality of evil, which is  clearly unempirical, or give up the idea of God as Creator of all.* He chooses  the latter. Wieman contends that the more empirical problem is to define the  actual nature and scope of evil, and not indulge in unempirical speculation  concerning its origin.95 At this point we turn to a discussion of his view of the  nature and scope of evil.  i. Evil as destructive of good  We have seen that Wieman follows Whitehead in defining God as “the prin-  ciple of concretion.”t On the basis of this definition evil is that which is de-  puctive of concrete existence. It is anything that hinders the prehensiveS  capacity of any particular thingg6  The more fully any object prehends the rest of being, the more it is subject  to the destructive works of evil. The higher we rise in the levels of prehension,  the greater place there is for the destructive works of  Since evil is destructive of good there can be no evil unless there is first  good.

Martin, Empirical Philosophies of Religion, p. 108: “From a consistently empirical point of  view, he holds, [the problem of evil] is really a false problem; it arises only when one departs  from the empirical evidence for God as ‘the good’, or the chief factor for good in nature, and  begins to speculate about God as also somehow the creator of all existence. That is, one must  either deny the reality of evil, which is clearly empirical, or give up the idea of God as Creator of  all. . . . Brightman’s idea of a finite deity only reformulates the false problem, which as stated is  truly ‘insoluble’. The more empirical problem is to define the actual nature and scope of evil, and  not to indulge in unempirical speculation as to its ‘origin’.’’  96. Henry Nelson Wieman, The Wrestle of Religion with Truth (New York: Macmillan, lgz7),  p. 200: “Evil is anything which hinders the prehensive capacity of any particular thing. . . . It is  destructive of concrete existence.”  97. Wieman, Wrestle of Relipon with Truth, pp. 200-201: “The more fully any object prehends  the rest of being, the more complicated and delicately balanced must all its adjustments be. . . .  The higher we rise in the levels of prehension, the greater place there is for the destructive works  of evil.”  98. Wieman, Wrestle of Religion with Truth, p. 201: “Since evil is the destruction of good there  can be no evil unless there is first the good. . . . Evil, then, is parasitic.

It can thrive and flourish only when there is good to sustain it.”  484 </p><div id="pagenum"><p>The Martin Luther King, Jr. Papers Project </p></div><div id="pagenum"><p>existence were it not for the principle of concretion which constitutes the </p></div><p id="page">good. Good and concrete existence are identical.”* The concrete order of the  world is good. Evil tends to destroy the order of concreteness,? and therefore  the whole order of existence.  Evil is not merely a principle of nonbeing or an absence of something. It is  both positive and aggressive.$ But God is not evil, nor can evil and good be  confused. Insofar as the existing world is concrete, it is due to the work of  God, the principle of concretion and order.99 But evil is destructive of all  levels of concreteness. So Wieman concludes:  God excludes evil, evil excludes God. God does not create evil nor sustain evil,  except as a parasite is sustained. Evil could not exist without God’s good to pro-  vide a standing ground; but the good alone is of God.§ 15Apr  1955  ii. Kinds of evil  Wieman distinguishes between those evils rooted in the nature of things not  caused by man and those that originate in human life. Evils rooted in the  nature of things are called “inertias” and “protective hierarchies.” Evils that  originate in human life are called sin and demonry.Io0  By inertia Wieman means more than simply the opposite of change. It is  first “lack of the sensitivity and responsiveness necessary to get the thought  and feeling of another or to participate appreciatively in a more complex com-  munity.”(( Secondly, it is resistance to that kind of transformation whereby the  individual organism, the world relative to that organism, and the associated  community are all re-created so as to increase qualitative meaning.# In short,  inertia is insensitivity and resistance to creativity.

Wieman, Wrestle of Religion with Truth, p. 202: “Evil is something positive and aggressive,  not merely the lack or absence of something. But God is not evil and there is no confusion of  good and evil. Insofar as the concrete world exists at all, it is due to God, the principle of concre-  tion and order.” Cf. Wieman and Horton, Growth of Religion, p. 358: “We do not mean to say that  evil is negative in the sense of being merely the absence of something. Particular evils are destruc-  tive and positive.”  100. Wieman, Source of Human Good, p. 105: “The most general classification of evils distin-  guishes between those rooted in the nature of things not caused by man and those that origi-  nate in human life. . . . Evils that originate in human life we shall call ‘sin,’ ‘immorality,’ and  ‘demonry.’ ”  485 </p><div id="pagenum"><p>The Martin Luther King, Jr. Papers Project </p></div><div id="pagenum"><p>15 Apr </p></div><p id="page">1955 to at least three things: the lack of vital energy, the running down of energy,  and the cancelling-out of conflicting energies.*I0’ This threat of inertia and  loss of meaning is not peculiar to human life. It hangs over all the world. It  seems to be a cosmic drift and threat. But Wieman is certain that it can be  conquered. He contends that there is a power more than human which works  against it.?

The transition from lower animal existence to  man may have been another such dangerous and difficult passage.” $  Another evil, derivative from this of inertia, is the evil of protective hierar-  chy. Wieman contends that there are many kinds of hierarchy, but his concern  is only with what he calls the “hierarchy of sensitivity.” When he speaks of the  “hierarchy of sensitivity,” Wieman means that the graded capacity to undergo  creative transformation and the graduated levels of sensitivity impose a hier-  archy on existence in which only the few at the top can be the medium  through which the creative event works most fully. This order of life is a hard  necessity, contends Wieman, but it is evil because not all forms of life, not  even all human organisms, can share equally the supreme fulfillments of  qualitative meaning; IO3 moreover “it is evil because some forms of life must  support other forms by enduring hardships or other stultifying effects that  * Wieman, SHG, 105. man’s view that God eter- within God.

Wieman, Source of Human Good, pp. 116- I 17: “This threat of inertia and loss of meaning  is not peculiar to human life. It hangs over all the world.

It is evil because it imposes upon many  an undue protection from pain and discomfort; upon some an undue fatigue  from hard labor; upon others impoverished. organisms; upon still others the  irresponsible existence which puts on the throne of life what they happen to like,  without demonstrating by any reliable method that it is truly most important.?  Wieman concludes that the high peak of creative transformation will continue  to soar far above the mass of people, with only a very few finding a place  there. This is a hard necessity, an evil inherent in the cosmic situation. But it  is a fact that we must face, ordering our lives accordingly.$Io4  The evils thus far treated are thrust upon man from sources outside of  human living, and are somewhat inherent in the nature of things. Wieman  admits that there are times when these evils pass over from the external  source to the internal affairs of man, making it hard to draw the line precisely  determining the place where human responsibility begins. Moreover, we un-  questionably have responsibility for many of the inertias and hierarchies. Nev-  ertheless, they are, by and large, thrust upon us from sources external to  human life.§ IO5  Sin and demonry are the two kinds of evil originating with man. Sin is any  resistance to creativity for which man is responsible. Man’s responsibility is not  limited to instances in which he is consciously aware of obstructing creativity  or deliberately intending to do so.

Man  can, if he will, be far more fully conscious of his sin than he generally is.Io6  “To be conscious of one’s sin is to be that far in the direction of deliverance  from it; for the deeper enslavement to sin is the state in which one is not  conscious of it.”*  When Wieman says that sin is man’s resistance to the creative event, he  refers to what was meant by the theological statement: “Sin is man’s rebellion  against the will of God.”lo7 Another way that Wieman describes sin is to say  that it is the creature turning against the creator-it is created good turning  against creativity.t Man’s personality, for instance, is a created good, and so  also are his society, his culture, and his ideals. He, with his society and ideals,  is forever refusing to surrender himself to the transforming power of the  creative event. This is sin. He refuses to provide the conditions which he could  provide and which are necessary for the freer working of creativity. This is  rebellion against God. The “will of God is the demand of creative power that  man provide conditions most favorable to its working.” lo8 When man fails to  remove or fight the conditions obstructing creativity he is failing to do the will  of God, and is thereby sinning.

The devil is what tempts man to sin in the most dan-  gerous and evil way; and the devil is also one of the most glorious sons of  God.L09 The devil is, symbolically speaking, “the most glorious vision of good  that our minds can achieve at any one time when that vision refuses to hold  itself subject to creativity.”* Wieman contends that this is the most subtle and  dangerous sin that man can commit. No vision of any race or culture at any  time may be listed up and made supreme against the creative event.”O  In the midst of the tremendous increase of power, due to the intensive  industrialization of the planet, some group will surely rise to the height of  power that no men ever before enjoyed. Such a group will be tempted to use  its power to achieve what seems to it good and refuse to use it to serve the  creative event.ILL To yield to such a temptation would mean that one is yield-  ing to the worse form of demonry.?  So we now see the distinction which Wieman makes between evils rooted in  the nature of things and those that originate in human life. Both types are  mutually destructive. However, it is those evils rooted in the nature of things  that we can do least about.  Traditional views have affirmed that evil will ultimately be overcome by the  workings of an almighty God. Wieman’s naturalism prevents him from ac-  cepting such a view. However, he does find some ground of hope from em-  pirical sources. First, there are the empirical facts of the increase of good  through millions of centuries. No one can doubt that qualitative meaning has  increased over the years. The second ground of hope is the fact that evil  cannot destroy creativity. It can only obstruct it.  Wieman finds an ultimate dualism more empirical than either a monistic  idealism which would deny the existence of evil, or a quasi-monistic idealism  which would seem to equivocate the issue.L12 15 Apr  1955  * Wieman, SHG, 128.  t Wieman, SHG, 129.  109.

Martin, Empirical Philosophies of Religzon, p. 108: “Thus Wieman, like Boodin, finds an  ultimate dualism more empirical than either a monistic idealism which would deny the existence  of evil, [or] a quasi-monistic idealism which would seem to equivocate the issue.”  489 </p><div id="pagenum"><p>The Martin Luther King, Jr. Papers Project </p></div><div id="pagenum"><p>‘5 APT iii. God’s finiteness </p></div><p id="page">’955  Wieman’s conclusions on the whole problem of evil reveal that he is a the-  istic finitist. A theistic finitist is one who holds that the eternal will of God  faces given conditions which that will did not create, whether those conditions  are ultimately within the personality of God or external to God. All theistic  finitists agree that there is something in the universe not created by God and  not a result of voluntary divine self-limitation, which God finds as either ob-  stacle or instrument to his will. Now it is clear that Wieman fits into this cate-  gory. He does not hesitate to affirm that God’s power is limited by evil. As we  have already seen, “inertias” and “hierarchies,” which are basic evils, originate  in sources external to God, the creative event. Wieman’s idea of a finite God  clearly comes out in his affirmation that “the problem of evil arises only when  you claim there is an almighty and perfectly good power that controls every-  thing. I make no such claim.”* God is only the source of the good and not of  the universe as a whole. Wieman is thus content with an ultimate dualism.?  He is confident, however, that although God is finite his purpose and work  cannot be defeated. In fact God tends to gain ground over the forces of evils  as time goes on. Wieman writes:  Our point is that the universe seems to be so constituted that this movement  toward higher integration springs up again and again under all manner of con-  ditions, places and times. Sometimes it mounts high, sometimes not so high.  Again and again it may be beaten back or overwhelmed. But on the whole it  seems to gain ground as ages pass.$  There is a striking parallel between Wieman’s thought at this point and  Brightman’s idea of God as “Controller of the Given.” Brightman contends  that God controls the Given in the sense that he never allows The Given to  run wild. “God’s control means that no defeat or frustration is final; that the  will of God, partially thwarted by obstacles in the chaotic Given, finds new  avenues of advance, and forever moves on in the cosmic creation of new  values.” Q  * Wieman, Art. (ig32)3,  t Wieman’s finite God  may be compared with  Brightman’s finite God at  many points. Brightman  holds to the idea of a per-  sonal finite God whose fi-  niteness consists in his  own internal structure:  An eternal unitary per-  sonal consciousness whose  creative will is limited  both by external necessi-  ties of reason and by eter- 201.  490 nal experiences of brute  fact. These limits Bright-  man calls “the Given.”  The Given is an aspect of  God’s consciousness which  eternally enters into every  moment of the divine ex-  perience and into every-  thing that is, either as ob-  stacle or as instrument to  the will of God. Wieman  denies that God is a per-  son. Also Wieman insists  that that which limits God  is outside of his nature. In a word, Wieman’s finite  God is a “process of inte-  gration” which is continu-  ally confronted with ex-  ternal conditions working  against integration.  Brightman’s finite God is a  personal being who is  continually confronted  with obstacles inside his  own nature.  $ Wieman, MPRL, 55.  3 Brightman, POR, 338. </p><div id="pagenum"><p>The Martin Luther King, Jr. Papers Project </p></div><div id="pagenum"><p>4. The question of the existence of God ‘5 Apr </p></div><p id="page">‘955  As we have seen, one of Wieman’s chief aims is that of making the question  of God’s existence a dead issue. To this end he sets forth the following defi-  nitions of God: “God is that actuality which sustains, promotes and constitutes  the supreme good.”” “God is that something upon which human life is most  dependent for its security, welfare, and increasing abundance. . . . , that some-  thing of supreme value which constitutes the most important conditions.” t  “God is that structure of existence and possibility which is supremely worth-  ful.”$ If God be defined as supreme value or as that process which underlies  and makes possible the maximum achievement of value, then the fact of his  existence, if not full knowledge of his specific nature, is “inescapable.” “The  best there is and can be. . . . is a self-proving proposition.”§ 113  Wieman’s interest in seeing a curtailment to the debate on the question of  God’s existence stems from his broader theocentric concern. He is deeply con-  cerned in seeing men turn all their energies to living for God and seeking  better knowledge about God. “Dispute about the existence of God,” says Wie-  man, “is blocking and diverting that outpouring of constructive energy which  religious devotion ought properly to release for the tasks that confront us.[\  So Wieman looks upon all arguments for the existence of God as futile and  invalid. Just as it is folly to attempt to prove the existence of nature to natural  creatures, or the United States to its citizens, it is equal folly to try to prove to  humans, whose essential nature consists in seeking, adoring, and serving what-  ever has greatest value, that there is something which has greatest value.# ’I4  So Wieman is led to say:  All the traditional arguments to prove the existence of God are as much out of  place in religion as arguments to prove the existence of nature would be in sci-  ence. Never in any of my writings have I tried to prove the existence of God  except by “definition,” which means to state the problem in such a way as to lift  it out of the arena of debate.**  * Wieman, Art.

As already stated, I hold such procedure folly.””  Despite his insistence that he has made the existence of God so certain that  all arguments for his existence are unnecessary, Wieman at times uses the  argument of the gradation of being, an argument quite prevalent in Thomis-  tic thinking. Wieman says, for example:  There are a number of general truths about reality which we know with a very  high degree of certainty, and these general truths are of utmost importance. We  have mentioned a few of them, such as the truth that I exists, that other people  exist, that there is better and worse and that, therefore, there is the inevitable  implication of better and worse, which is the Best, or God.?  In a more concise passage he says:  Since I know there is better and worse, I know there is the Best; for the best is  the inevitable implication of the reality of better and worse. When I say ‘God’, I  mean the best there is. Therefore I know God is.$  In both of these passages Wieman is explicitly seeking to prove the existence  of God through the argument of the gradation of being. This certainly con-  flicts with his persistent claim that all arguments for God’s existence are inva-  lid. We must conclude, therefore, that Wieman fails to achieve one of his basic  objectives, viz., making the question of God’s existence a dead issue. Against  his fundamental intentions, he ends up seeking to prove (whether consciously  or unconsciously) the existence of God.  5. The question of the personality  in God  One of the most controversial phases of Wieman’s thought hinges around  the question of personality of God. In his earlier works Wieman granted the  possibility that God might be mental or personal. “Nature,” he says, “may very  well be moved and sustained by the operation of a supreme mind or person-  ality.’’§ Again he says: “It may be that what gives the character and creative  advance to the whole of nature and every part of nature is that there is opera-  tive throughout the whole of nature a mind.”II  Despite this earlier willingness to grant the possibility of personality in God,  Wieman, in his later works, emphatically denies that God can be a person. He  is convinced that “God towers in unique majesty infinitely above the little hills  which we call minds and personalities.”# In order to get a better understand-  ing of Wieman’s thought at this point, we turn to a discussion of the objections  * Wieman, Art.

Objections to the idea of a  personal God  One of the basic reasons why Wieman objects to the idea of a personal God  is his contention that personality is inconceivable apart from a society of per-  sons. Personality is generated by interaction between individuals. If this is the  case then God cannot be a personality. The only ground on which the theory  can be defended is on the basis of the doctrine of the trinity. But there is not  the slightest empirical evidence, contends Wieman, of such an ontological  trinity.*  Another reason why Wieman denies that God is mental or personal is  found in the essential limitations of personality. Something infinitely richer  and more pervasive and precious than personality produces and constitutes  the value of the world. Indeed it is this something which generates person-  ality. Wieman turns to the sciences of personality, psychology, social psy-  chology, and anthropology to gain validation for his contention that it is  something more than a personality which generates personality, sustains and  promotes its growth, and brings it to highest fulfillment. The reality which  does all this, according to these disciplines, is a very complex and delicate  system of connections of mutual control which grows up between the indi-  vidual psycho-physical organism and its physical and social en~ironment.’’~  For similar reasons Wieman cannot conceive of God as “mind.” Mind and  personality are “summit characters” in nature, but they are not universal fea-  tures of nature as are process and interaction. To possess mind would auto-  matically limit God. In discussing God in relation to prayer, Wieman says:  To be conscious as we know consciousness is to have focus of attention. But to  have focus of attention is to be able to attend to a few things in a certain area  and not to attend to anything beyond. Can God function as God must, if he is so  limited? . . . To have human mentality God must see things from a viewpoint  that is localized at a certain time and p1ace.t  As we have seen, Wieman holds that the work of God is clearly distin-  guished from that of man. The difference is not merely of degree or magni-  tude. It is a difference of kind. An understanding of this distinction is all-  * Wieman, SHG, 266.  Wieman, NPOR, 133.  115.

He looks upon mecha-  nisms and organisms as two different kinds of systems which enter into the  existence of almost everything.l16 “A mechanism is a system of external rela-  tions. An organism is a system of internal relations or, as I prefer to say, of  organic connections.”” Therefore when things are internally related, they un-  dergo transformation and mutually control one another.”’  So God’s work is the growth of organic connections, i.e., “the growth of  meaning and value.” This is not and can never be the work of man. Since  God’s way of working is so different from that of mind as seen in man, Wie-  man concludes that God is more than mind.l18 “Mind,” Wieman writes, “is just  exactly what God is not. God is not intelligence, for what God does is. . . .  exactly the opposite of what intelligence does.” t  Another basic reason why Wieman rejects the claim of a personal God is to  be found in his general naturalistic and empiricistic positions. As we have  seen, he is determined to confine God to nature. God is the “creative event”  within nature rather than the “creative event” above nature. There is not the  slightest empirical evidence that God as the creative event within nature is  personal in character. Empirical observation points more to process and in-  teraction than to personality as the basic character of the “creative event.”  Although Wieman denies the personality of God, he is quite certain that he  preserves in God those things which the religious man is demanding when he  asserts that God must be a person. God does respond to the intimate needs  and attitudes of the individual personality.$ Moreover, human personality  and fellowship find in God the source of their origin, the continuous source  of their enrichment, and the condition of their most abundant flowering.O 119 1955 mind.  * Wieman, Art.

The fact that God is not personal does not mean that he is impersonal.  Wieman insists that God responds to personal adjustments in a “personal”  manner, and that his nature must be so conceived that it accounts for the  existence of personality. Because of this God cannot be impersonal. Actually,  God is not sub-personal but supra-personal. Therefore, Wieman uses the per-  sonal pronoun in referring to God, though at the same time conscious of its  inadequacy.?  ii. God as process  One of the first things that the interpreter of Wieman discovers is his per-  sistent affirmation that God belongs to the category of process. This appears  throughout all his definitions of God. In one book Wieman refers to God as  that integrating process which works through all the world not only to bring  human lives into fellowship with one another but also to maintain and develop  organic interdependence and mutual support between all parts and aspects of  the cosmos.$  Again he says:  God is that integrating process at work in the universe. It is that which makes  for increasing interdependence and cooperation in the world.§  * Wieman, SHG, f Wieman, MPRL, 22.  267-268.

Therefore Wieman uses the  personal pronoun in referring to God, being at the same time conscious of its inadequacy.” 495 </p><div id="pagenum"><p>The Martin Luther King, Jr. Papers Project </p></div><div id="pagenum"><p>15 Apr </p></div><p id="page">1955 Elsewhere he declares: “God is that interaction between things which gener-  ates and magnifies personality and all its highest values.”* Now an interaction  is not a thing or a concrete object; t it is a process in which concrete objects  affect one another; it is an event, not a continuing entity. Interactions are not  “persistent realities.” $  When Wieman speaks of God as integrating process at the level of human  society he means the process by which men are made increasingly interde-  pendent and their behavior is so changed as to make them more cooperative  and mutually helpful one to the other. Because this process goes on indepen-  dently of human purpose Wieman calls it superhuman. But while it is more  than human it will not lift humanity to the great goods of life unless men  make right adaptation to it. “The process goes on whether we will or no, but  we must ‘get right with it’ if we would escape catastrophe.”§l2I  Wieman makes it clear that this process of progressive integration which is  seen at work in human society is cosmic in scope. It can be seen in electrons  interacting in such a way as to make atoms, atoms to make molecules, mole-  cules to make cells, cells to make living organisms, living organisms to make  individual minds and human society. This process of progressive integration  is quite similar to what Smuts calls Holism, Whitehead the principle of con-  cretion, S. Alexander and Loyd Morgan the nisus toward ever higher creative  syntheses, and Hocking the Whole Idea.122  Another way in which Wieman expresses the idea that God belongs to the  category of process is that of referring to God as the pattern of behavior. He  notices that the universe is not a passive state of being; it is rather a total event  which is continually transpiring. It is a total event made up of an infinite  number of subordinate events. In other words, the universe is continually  behaving.  Now this behavior of the universe, which is infinitely complex and varied,  * Wieman, ITG, 13. 45. t Wieman, WRT, 193. 0 Wieman, WRT, 62.  $ Wieman, Art. (1g32)~,  121.

This pattern of behavior upon which man </p></div><p id="page">is dependent for maximum security and increase of good, is the God of the  universe. “God is the behavior of the universe which has thus nurtured hu-  man life and which continues to keep it going and growing.” lZ3  As we have seen above, Wieman makes it clear that God is not to be identi-  fied with all patterns of behavior or with the universe in its entirety (panthe-  ism). Only that pattern of behavior can be called God “which preserves and  increases to the maximum the total good of all human living where right ad-  justment is made.””  From the above we may conclude that Wieman’s God is a process, an order  of events, a system or patten of behavior. All of this is consistent with his  naturalistic leanings. Traditional theism tends to see God as an all-powerful  person who is the shaper of events, or the overruler of them, or somehow the  generator of them. Wieman however, following his naturalistic learnings, sees  God as a process within nature, a process which is the structure or order of  events. 15 Apr  1955  6. Wieman’s use of specifically Christian  symbols in his conception of God  No exposition of Wieman’s mature view of God is complete without a dis-  cussion of the rather illuminating way in which he reinterprets many of the  traditional Christian concepts concerning God. Wieman seeks to preserve and  interpret everything which has given power to the life and worship of the  Christian religion. As we have seen, this interpretation is made in the frame  of his own naturalistic processes of thought. “Nothing has value except ma-  terial events. . . .”? This means that most of the terms of classical Christianity  must be used with a new and different meaning. These subtle changes in  meaning must always be kept in the mind of the interpreter of Wieman be-  cause of Wieman’s constant tendency of using historical phrases in a sense  other than that which has been carried by them in the past.  Wieman’s whole life’s work represents the most valiant attempt to keep the  values of evangelical Christianity while discarding its philosophy and thelogy.  He looks upon the literal interpretation of most Christian doctrines as absurd  and unscientific. But when these literal interpretations are removed, Christian  doctrines are found to have a symbolic value that is indispensable for living  religion. In an article which appeared in a series entitled, “How My Mind Has  Changed in the Last Decade,” Wieman writes:  * Wieman, WRT, 62.  t Wieman, SHG, 8.  123.

I do not  think that this indicates any access to orthodoxy. But I find that when the ambi-  guities and superstitions and superficialities have been cleared away from these  ancient forms of expressions, they carry a depth and scope of meaning which no  other words can convey, because the same history which has made them has  made us.*  With these propaedeutic remarks we turn now to a discussion of the basic  Christian symbols which receive fruitful treatment in Wieman’s conception  of God.  i. The grace of God  Wieman agrees with the view that man can never achieve the good by his  own power. Whenever man uses his power to serve the good that is discerned  by his own appreciative consciousness rather than serve the good that is de-  termined by the creative power of God, his efforts are doomed to defeat.?  The structure of man’s appreciative consciousness is too limited in scope and  distorted in form ever to become an independent guide for human life. Man’s  awareness of this inadequacy leads to despair. But the despair which arises at  this point is not totally destructive; it really opens the way to salvation; for  despair concerning the adequacy of his own appraisal of value may lead man  to give himself to the guiding grace of God.$ lz4  Despair for its own sake has no value. But when it turns man from trust in  his own reason or sense of value to absolute trust in the grace of God, it opens  the way to salvation. “As a gateway into this transformed way of living, where  security is found in the power and goodness of God, despair is the highest  wisdom.” §  Now what is this “grace of God” upon which man is so dependent. The  grace of God is “creative transformation become dominant in the life of  man.”[/ Every individual has the important task of searching out the nature of  creativity and seeking to live in accord with its demands. But the actual di-  recting toward the good and the actual achievement of it cannot be exercised  by the ability of man; this can be done only by the creative event when ac-  * Wieman, Art.

Divine love and justice  Wieman’s interpretation of the love of God grows out of his doctrine of the  creativity of God. As we have seen, God is the growth of connection between  sensitive organisms, all the way from cells and plant spores to human person-  alities and groups. He is that creative interaction from which originates all the  richness of experience, as well as personality and society. So as human person-  alities we are both originally and continuously generated by God’s creativity.  God’s love is this creativity.t lZ6  God’s “judgment” is inseparable from his love. It is the same thing working  under different conditions. God’s love is the growth of connections whereby  individuals and groups are brought closer together in mutual interaction. It  is what we have just described as creativity. God’s judgment is the “mutual  destructiveness” which comes to individuals and groups as a result of their  resistance to the transformtion which is required by the new life of interde-  pendence. The closer drawn the cords of love, the more destructive of one  another do men become when they resist the transformation brought forth  by these closer connections.$ 127  iii.

Sin is clinging to anything, or the striving after  anything, when such clinging or striving is obstructive to creative transfor-  mation.*IZ* Sin is anything in one’s personality which resists the creativity of  God. When sin is unforgiven, God cannot overcome this resistance except by  destroying the individual or group which does the resisting. When sin is for-  given the resistance is still present but God can overcome it without destroying  the persons who do the resisting.? IZ9  Before this forgiveness of sin can be accomplished at least three things are  required. First, creative interaction must be released from the coercive and  absolute control of any one order of life or set of structures. Wieman holds  that this first condition for the forgiveness of sin was partially met in the  Roman Empire by the intermingling of races and the interpenetration of  cultures.$ 130  The second condition which has to be met in order that sins be forgiven is  that a psychological, social historical process get under way which would make  creativity potent and sovereign over the lives of a few (at least) so that no hope  or dream, no ideal or order of existence could exercise equal control over them.§  This was accomplished by the life, crucifixion and resurrection of Jesus  Christ.Is1 We shall discuss Wieman’s conception of the death and resurrection  of Christ subsequently.  .. ’?’. .  * Wieman, SHG, 278.  t Wieman, Art.

The confession and repen-  tance of sin means three things. It means, first, to recognize that there is some-  thing de‘ep in one’s personality which does resist the transformation required  for that fullness of creative interaction demanded by the connections one has  with other people.*’32  Confession and repentance of sin mean, in the second place, that one shall  resolve repeatedly to hold oneself subject to every transformation required by  creative interaction, no matter what pain or loss such changes may involve.? 133  Confession and repentance of sin mean in the third place that one must  search out every habit, every object of desire, fear, hope, and dread which  seems to be recalcitrant to creative interaction, and resolve that each of these  shall be taken from or given to one only as creative interaction may require.’34  “Nothing shall be mine except as I receive it from the creativity of God. Noth-  ing shall be held back by me when the creativity of God would take it away.”$  Whenever the three conditions stated above are met, Wieman is certain that  God’s forgiving power will be at work. God’s forgiveness is not some static  decree. Rather it is a dynamic reality working in history, in society and in each  personality who meets the necessary conditions. 15 Apr  1955  iv. The crucifixion and resurrection  of Christ  Wieman looks upon the death and resurrection of Christ as indispensable  events for the salvation of man. Jesus during his life developed in a small  group of men a richness ofkreative interaction that was unique and sublime.  * Wieman, Art. (ig40)~, 164.  t Wieman, Art. (ig40)~, 164.  $ Wieman, Art.

Up to this point we have attempted to interpret the conceptions  of God held by Wieman and Tillich separately, without any mention of their  points of agreement or disagreement. Now we will look at their conceptions  of God together, with a view of determining their convergent and divergent  points.  We shall see as the discussion develops that Wieman and Tillich have much  more in common than is ordinarily supposed. It has been a not too infrequent  tendency to group Wieman with the naturalistic thinkers and Tillich with  the neo-supernaturalistic thinkers. As we have seen, even Wieman himself  attaches the neo-supernaturalist tag to Tillich. In The Growth of Religion,  Wieman grouped Barth, Brunner, Niebuhr, and Tillich together as neo-  supernaturalists. A close analysis of Tillich, however, will reveal that he can-  not so easily be grouped with the neo-supernaturalists. There is much in his  thinking that smacks of religious naturalism. His opposition to supernatural-  ism is much more pronounced than his opposition to naturalism. He is for-  ever revolting against the view that there is a world behind the world.  Yet despite these similarities between Wieman and Tillich which are often  overlooked, we must recognize that there are important differences between  the two. Any adequate comparison of Wieman and Tillich will recognize their  differences along with their points of concurrence.  1. God’s existence  One of the basic points at which Tillich and Wieman concur is in affirming  that God is an undeniable reality. Both are so convinced of the reality of God  that they would dismiss all arguments for the existence of God as futile and  invalid. As we have seen, Tillich contends that theologians and philosophers  should have said something about the ontological implications of finitude  rather than present elaborate arguments for the existence of God. “The ar-  guments for the existence of God,” contends Tillich, “neither are arguments  nor are they proof of the existence of God.

Wieman thinks that the existence of Cod is as certain as  any reality in the physical world; this God is capable of being perceived  through the senses. Hence any attempt to prove the existence of God is as  futile as attempting to prove the existence of the physical world or the people  about us. Wieman laconically states: “All the traditional arguments to prove  the existence of God are as much out of place in religion as arguments to  prove the existence of nature would be in science.”?  On the other hand, Tillich finds the traditional arguments invalid because  of his contention that God transcends the category of existence. To say “God  exists” is, for Tillich, the basest blasphemy. “It is as atheistic to affirm the  existence of God,” asserts Tillich, “as it is to deny it.”$ Tillich feels that it  would be a great victory for Christian apologetics if the words “God” and  “existence” were very definitely separated. God does not ,exist. He transcends  the categories of essence and existence. Therefore, to argue that Cod exists,  affirms Tillich, is to deny him.§’  Wieman is far more willing to apply the term existence to God than Tillich.  Wieman never wearies of pointing out that God exists. Tillich’s insistence that  God transcends the category of existence grows out of his basic conviction  that Cod is being-itself. This means that Cod is not g being, not even the most  powerful or most perfect being. All discussions of the existence of God start  out with the assumption that God is something or someone, i.e. a being. But  this objectification or “thingification” of God, asserts Tillich, is blasphemy.*  So Tillich finds it necessary to say “God does not exist” because his onto-  logical analysis leads him to define God as being-itself. Wieman, on the other  hand, finds it necessary to say “God exists” because his naturalistic position  leads him to define God as the creative event within nature. However, at bot-  tom Tillich and Wieman are seeking to convey the same idea, viz., that the  reality of God is an indubitable certainty. They are seeking to lift the question  of God out of the arena of debate.  There is a further point at which Tillich and Wieman seem to be in agree- 1955 dure folly.”*  * Wieman, Art.

Both seek to assure the reality of </p></div><p id="page">God through the definition of God. As we have seen, Wieman seeks “so to  formulate the idea of God that the question of God’s existence becomes a dead  issue, like the question of the other inescapable forms of initial existence.” *  To accomplish this he has offered as a “minimal” definition of God the follow-  ing: “God is that something upon which human life is most dependent for its  security, welfare, and increasing abundance . . . that something of supreme  value which constitutes the most important conditions.”? If God be defined  as supreme value or as that process which underlies and makes possible the  maximum achievement of value, then the fact of his existence is “inescap-  able,” he feels. “The best there is and can be . . . is a self-proving proposi-  tion.”$ So Wieman feels that just as it is folly to attempt to prove the existence  of nature to natural creatures, or the United States to its citizens, it is equal  folly to try to prove to human beings, whose essential nature consists in seek-  ing, adoring, and serving whatever has greatest value, that there is something  which has greatest value. He says: “Never in any of my writings have I tried  to prove the existence of God except by definition.”§ So Wieman is confident  that he has solved the problem of proving God’s existence by a definition.  Like Wieman, Tillich seeks through his definition of God to assure the re-  ality of God and make it virtually impossible to deny him. Tillich’s position at  this point is clearly set forth in the following statement:  The name of this infinite and inexhaustible depth and ground of all being is  God. This is what the word God means. . . . If you know that God means depth  then you know much about him. You cannot then call yourselves atheists or  unbelievers. For you cannot think and say: “There is no depth in life! Life itself  is shallow. Being itself is surface.” Only if you could say this in complete serious-  ness you would be atheists-otherwise not.11 15 Apr  1955  Thus Tillich, like Wieman, is seeking so to formulate the idea of God that  the question of God’s existence becomes a dead issue.# As we have seen, Til-  lich’s basic definition of God is “being-itself” or “power of being.” God as  being-itself neither needs nor can receive proof. He is that ultimate-Tillich’s  term is das Unbedingte-which is a certain quality of the world man encoun-  ters and which analysis reveals as “presupposed” in all his encountering. In  other words, Tillich is seeking to say that God is presupposed in the question  * Wieman, Art. (ig32)3,  276.  t Wieman, RESM, 9.  $ Wieman, Art. (ig31)2,  171.  $ Wieman, Art. (ig3~)~,  284.

Tillich  feels that such an ap-  proach is in line with the  ontological method of the  philosophy of religion, the  method which he (Tillich)  feels is most adequate.  Tillich states: “If the idea  of God is to be formulated  in such a way that the question of God’s exis-  tence becomes a dead is-  sue” (Wieman), . . . we are  in an ontological atmo-  sphere, although the on-  tological approach is not  clearly stated and its rela-  tion to the cosmological  approach and to faith is  not adequately ex-  plained.” (Art. (1946)*, 9).  505 </p><div id="pagenum"><p>The Martin Luther King, Jr. Papers Project </p></div><div id="pagenum"><p>15 Apr </p></div><p id="page">1955 of God. One cannot deny him without affirming him. God as the “power of  being,” as Seinsmachtigkeit is the source of all power. Thus the power of  thought is derived from the ground of power. So far as one has power, con-  tends Tillich, he cannot escape God. For God as “power of being” is that  power by which one doubts, feels, thinks, knows, exists.  So by defining God as “being-itself’’ or “power of being,” Tillich has made  it virtually impossible for one to deny the reality of God. Even to deny him is  to affirm him, because he is the power by which the denial is made.  Wieman and Tillich are at one in seeking to define God in such a way that  even the sceptic and atheist cannot deny his existence. They believe they have  solved the problem of proving the reality of God by a definition.  We may raise the question at this point whether Wieman and Tillich have  been successful in their endeavors to make the question of God’s existence a  dead issue. In criticising Wieman’s general procedure at this point, Macintosh  suggests that an easy way to prove the existence of God to the satisfaction of  everyone, is to reduce the definition of the term until everyone, even the  confessed atheist will have to admit his existence. Macintosh questions this  procedure on the ground that it gains assurance that God is by drastically  subtracting from what God meanss3  This criticism is basically sound, and it applies to Tillich’s procedure as well  as Wieman’s. Both Wieman and Tillich, in their attempt to formulate the idea  of God so as to make the question of God’s existence a dead issue, have given  up much that is most essential from the religious point of view in the idea of  God. As we shall see subsequently, both Tillich and Wieman reject the concep-  tion of a personal God, and with this goes a rejection of the rationality, good-  ness and love of God in the full sense of the words. An impersonal “being-  itself” or “creative event” cannot be rational or good, for these are attributes  of personality.  It seems that in the Christian message, “God” means “a being,” not “being-  itself.” He is of course, not a being “alongside” others, but He is a being  “above others.” Therefore “existence” can be predicated of Him, though not  the contingent finite existence of His creatures. He is not merely “the ground  of everything personal”; He is personal Him~elf.~  * Macintosh, Art. (igsz),  24.  3, D. C. Macintosh, “Is There a God?” in Morrison, ed., Is There a God? pp. 22-23: “Eager to  demonstrate the existence of God to the satisfaction of everybody, one might begin by reducing  the definition of God until the term means no more, to begin with, than everyone, even the  confessed atheist, will have to admit to exist. . . . What I question . . . is his adding to the assurance  that God is by subtracting so drastically and, it would seem, so permanently, from what God means.”  4. Thomas, “Method and Structure,” p. 104: “It seems to me that in the Christian message,  ‘God’ means ‘a being,’ not ‘being-itself.’ He is, of course, not a being ‘alongside’ others, but He is  a being ‘above others.’ Therefore ’existence’ can be predicated of Him, though not the contingent  finite existence of His creatures. . . . He is not merely ‘the ground of everything personal’; He is  personal Himself.” 506 </p><div id="pagenum"><p>The Martin Luther King, Jr. Papers Project </p></div><div id="pagenum"><p>Moreover, the Christian God is not merely an impersonal process within </p></div><p id="page">nature. He is a personal being above nature, forever giving meaning and di-  rection to process. If this is the Christian view, it is clear that Tillich’s and  Wieman’s statement of it has been weakened at points by their attempt to  make the question of God’s existence a dead issue. Both Wieman and Tillich  sacrifice too much for the sake of getting rid of a troublesome question.  Another question that we must raise at this point is the accuracy of making  the question of “proof” of God’s existence irrelevant by definition. In this  procedure both Wieman and Tillich, whether they realize it or not, are em-  ploying a version of the ontological argument. This raises the perennial ques-  tion whether the being of anything can be “proved” by definition, by the re-  finement of a concept.  It must be pointed out that the versions of the ontological argument set  forth by Tillich and Wieman are quite different from the Anselmic version of  the ontological argument. Anselm sought to prove the existence of the being  with the richest conceivable attributes, while Wieman and Tillich seek to  prove by definition “a being of minimum specifications.” In other words,  Anselm sought to prove the existence of God by a definition with maximum  specification of attributes, while Tillich and Wieman seek to prove the reality  of God by definitions with minimum specifications. In all three cases, how-  ever, the reality of God is involved in the definition of God, and hence is a  necessary truth of reason. So Tillich’s and Wieman’s versions of the ontologi-  cal argument present some of the same difficulties that men like Thomas  Aquinas and Immanuel Kant found in the Anselmic version. 15 Apr  1955  2. The personality of God  Tillich and Wieman are in one accord in denying the category of person-  ality to God. They feel that to refer to God as a person is to limit him. Both  would agree that “God towers in unique majesty infinitely above the little hills  which we call minds and personalities.”*  They differ somewhat, however, in the reasons given for objecting to the  claim of a personal God. The basic reason for Wieman’s objection is to found  in his general naturalistic and empiricistic positions. We have seen that, for  Wieman, the basic things in the world are events, happenings, or processes.  There is nothing transcending or undergirding events. Everything that exists  is either an event, an aspect of an event, or a relation between or within  events. This means that God must be found in the natural order. Like every-  thing else that exists, God is a material being, a process with an enduring  structure which distinguishes his character from that of other proce~ses.~ God  * Wieman, Art. (1936)*, 432.  5.

There is not the slightest empirical evidence, contends Wieman, that  God as the creative event within nature is personal in character. Empirical  observation reveals that personality is limited to creatures.  Wieman feels that it is much more empirical to refer to God as process than  as personality. Throughout his definitions of God there is the persistent affir-  mation that God belongs to the category of process. He refers to God as an  “integrating process,”” an “interaction,”? a “pattern of behavior,”$ and the  “creative event.”§ In each of these definitions, Wieman is seeking to say that  God is not a concrete object; he is a process in which concrete objects affect  one another; he is an event, not a continuing entity. So Wieman is certain that  empirical observation points more to process and interaction as the basic char-  acter of the “creative event” than to personality.  Tillich’s objection to the claim of a personal God, unlike Wieman’s, grows  out of his general ontological analysis. This leads him to affirm that person-  ality is a characteristic of beings, not of being-itself. Personality might be ap-  plied to being-itself in a symbolic sense, meaning that God is the ground of  everything personal, but never can it be applied to him in a literal sense.  Being-itself transcends the categories of finitude, and is prior to the split of  subject and object. To speak of God as a person would mean making him an  object besides other objects, a being among beings, maybe the highest, but  anyhow a being.6 But to objectify God in such a sense is, for Tillich, the basest  blasphemy.  Tillich’s objection to the conception of a personal God does not lead him to  affirm with Wieman that God is process. Tillich feels that a God who is merely  process is as limited as a God who is merely a person. God as being-itself is  infinitely more than process or interaction.  It is interesting to note that Wieman and Tillich concur on the point that  God is not impersonal. The fact that they deny that God is personal does not  mean, for them, that God is impersonal. Wieman insists that God responds to  personal adjustments in a “personal” manner, and that his nature must be so  conceived that it accounts for the existence of personality.1) Tillich, in a similar  vein, insists that God is the ground of everything personal and that he carries  within himself the ontological power of personality.#’ Because of this, God can-  * Wieman, MPRL, 22, ‘3. /) Wieman, COR,  t Wieman, Art.

In brief, Wieman and Tillich are certain that God is not </p></div><p id="page">sub-personal but supra-personal. Therefore they use the personal pronoun  in referring to God, being at the same time conscious of its inadequacy.*8  In spite of their insistence that the idea of a personal God is confusing,  Tillich and Wieman agree that the symbol is of vital importance for religious  worship. Wieman says that “the mythical symbol of person or personality may  be indispensable for the practice of worship and personal devotion to the  creative power, this need arising out of the very nature of creative interac-  tion. . . .”t Tillich finds the symbol of a personal God indispensable for living  religion, if for no other reason than that, as the philosopher Schelling says,  “only a person can heal a per~on.”~ He further contends that this kind of  symbolism must be maintained against pantheistic and naturalistic criticism,  lest religion fall back to the level of a primitive-demonic pre-personalism.$  It must be pointed out that Tillich and Wieman use the word “symbol” in a  somewhat different sense. Wieman uses symbol to mean little more than a  sign. It is the creation of a subjective desire. Tillich, on the other hand, insists  that a symbol is more than a technical sign. The basic characteristic of the  symbol is its innate power. The genuine symbol participates in the reality of  that which it symbolizes. Moreover, true symbols indicate something about  the nature of God, but that indication is never precise, unambiguous, literal.  So when Tillich speaks of personality as a symbolic expression of God’s na-  ture, he is sure that here is an implicit indication of the nature of God. 15 Apr  1955  Several points require comment.  1. How sound is Wieman’s view that God is process instead of personality?  Wieman sees God as unifying activity seeking to bring about an organic unity  as yet very incompletely actualized. This means that there is a gap between  actual existence and unrealized possibility, between timeless forms and fluent  process. Now this gap must be filled by God if he is properly performing his  unifying activity. But in order to fill the gap, God must transcend the process  and yet be active and actual. In other words, in order for God to perform his  unifying activity, he must be more than process. He must have some unwav-  * Wieman, IOL, much as it is an ‘It,’ and it happens in monism and  219-230. Tillich’s posi- is above both of them.

This means that he must  transcend the flux of events.  2. Wieman speaks of God as a system of events. The question still remains,  however, what it is that generates the system. What is it that stands behind the  system to account for its systematic character? Wieman leaves this problem  unsolved because he refuses to see God as a concrete object or entity. He has  tried to get away from metaphysics by defining God as a system of interac-  tions, but he has merely succeeded in posing the problem of accounting for  the system.”  3. Tillich affirms that God is personal in the sense that he is the ground of  personality. God lives in that he is the ground of life. God is good in that he  is the ground of goodness. Now since it is Tillich’s conviction that God as  “being-itself” is the ground of all being, it logically follows from this type of  thinking that God is also evil and impersonal since he is the ground of these.  4. Both Tillich and Wieman contend that God is “supra-personal.” Now if  this means that Deity represents a higher type of consciousness and will than  that represented by human personality, it simply states what has been main-  tained by almost every theistic personalist. As Thomas Aquinas says: “The  name person is fittingly applied to God; not, however, as it is applied to crea-  tures, but in a more excellent way (via eminentiae).””  But it is one thing to say that personality which is in part known includes  experiences which we do not yet know; and it is quite another thing to say  that there is an entity of some sort which is lacking in consciousness and ratio-  nality. It is in the latter sense that Wieman and Tillich seem to speak. Such a  position never reveals to us whether an unconscious “supra-personality” is  better or worse than personality.  Certainly it seems more empirical to ascribe personality to God than to as-  cribe “supra-personality’’ to him. In the world of experiences the basic source  of personality production and sustenance has been personality. Now when we  are confronted with the fact of personality production and sustenance on a  cosmic scale, why not ascribe the source to cosmic personality? It would be  better by far to admit that there are difficulties with an idea we know-such  as personality-than to employ a term which is practically unknown to us in  our experience.  The “supra-personal” is a term without any concrete content; it is at best  but a label for the unknown, and not a definable hypothesis. If we are, there-  * Quoted from Knudson,  DOG, 300.  11. Homer H. Dubs, “Religious Naturalism-An Evaluation,” Journal of Religion 23, no. 4  (1943): 260: “If God is a system of events, we must still inquire what it is that generates this  system; what it is that stands behind the system to account for its systematic character.

He has tried to get away from metaphysics  by defining God as a system of interactions; he has merely succeeded in posing the problem of  accounting for that system.” </p><div id="pagenum"><p>The Martin Luther King, Jr. Papers Project </p></div><div id="pagenum"><p>fore, to think of God, it must be either under the personal or some impersonal </p></div><p id="page">form. There is no third alternative. But even though this be admitted, Wie-  man and Tillich would still insist that personality involves limitation and SO is  inapplicable to God. This idea, however, rests upon a false conception of the  nature of personality. It is certainly true that human personality is limited,  but personality as such involves no necessary limitation. It means simply self-  consciousness and self-direction. The idea of personality is so consistent with  the notion of the absolute that we must say with Bowne “that complete and  perfect personality can be found only in the Infinite and Absolute Being, as  only in him can we find that complete and perfect selfhood and self-expres-  sion which is necessary to the fullness of personality.”” The conception of  God as personal, therefore, does not imply limitation of any kind.  5. All the conclusions of Tillich and Wieman seem to point to an imper-  sonal God. Despite their warnings that God is not less than personal, we see  traits throughout their thinking that point to a God that is less than personal.  Wieman’s God, for instance, is an interaction, that is, a behavior process. Just  as the psychological behaviorist takes man’s behavior as man himself, Wieman  takes God’s behavior as God himse1f.t Thus God is not a concrete object or a  continuing entity. He is a process. In short, Wieman’s God is an unconscious  process devoid of any true purpose.  Tillich’s God is “being-itself” or the “power of being.” But “being-itself,” as  we have seen, is little more than a sub-personal reservoir of power, somewhat  akin to the impersonalism of Oriental Vedantism.$ “Being-itself” suggests a  pure absolute devoid of consciousness and life. Even Tillich himself uncon-  sciously recognizes that “being-itself’’ is such an absolute. Concerning a living  God he says:  Most of the so-called anthropomorphisms of the biblical picture of God are ex-  pressions of his character as living. His actions, his passions, his remembrances  and anticipations, his suffering and joy, his personal relations and his plans-all  these make him a living God and distinguish him from the pure absolute, from  being-itself.§ 15 Apr  1955  Here Tillich is saying what we have been implying all along, viz., that “being-  itself” is an impersonal absolute devoid of life.  So Wieman and Tillich conclude by choosing the less-than-personal to ex-  plain personality, purpose and meaning.  6.

Is it possible to worship a behavior  process or an impersonal absolute? It hardly seems so. The impersonal may  be an object of thought. But before thought, which is subjective activity, can  pass into worship, which is a process of communion and intercourse between  living minds, the impersonal must be per~ona1ized.l~  The religious man has always recognized two fundamental religious values.  One is fellowship with God, the other is trust in his goodness.* Both of these  imply the personality of God. No fellowship is possible without freedom and  intelligence. There may be interactions between impersonal beings, but not  fellowship. True fellowship and communion can exist only between beings  who know each other and take a volitional attitude toward each other. If God  is a mere “interaction” or “process” as Wieman would say, or merely “being-  itself” as Tillich would say, no communion with him would be possible. Fel-  lowship requires an outgoing of will and feeling. This is what the Scripture  means when it refers to God as the “living” God. Life as applied to God means  that in God there is feeling and will, responsive to the deepest yearnings of  the human heart; this God both evokes and answers prayer.I4  It may be true that on the impersonal plane religion seeks union with the  Divine Being.I5 But this type of union is vastly different from that of personal  beings. As Knudson has so well put it:  * See Knudson, DOG,  304-308.  13. Andrew Martin Fairbairn, The Philosophy of the Christian Relipon (New York: Macmillan,  1902), p. 241: “No impersonal Being whether named fate or chance, necessity or existence, the  soul or the whole, can be an object of worship, though it may be an object of thought. . . . The  impersonal must be personalized before thought, which is a subjective activity, can pass into  worship, which is a reciprocal action, or a process of converse and intercourse between living  minds.”  14. Albert C. Knudson, The Doctrine ofGod (New York: Abingdon Press, ig30), pp. 305-306:  “There are two fundamental religious values. One is fellowship with God, the other is trust in his  goodness; and both of these imply his personality. No fellowship is possible without freedom and  intelligence. There may be interactions between impersonal beings, both organic and inorganic.  But true communion can exist only between beings who know each other and take an emotional  and volitional attitude toward each other. If God were pure intellect, as Aristotle conceived him  to be, no communion with him would be possible. . . . Fellowship . . . requires an outgoing of  feeling and will. This it is that underlies the moving word of Scripture, the ‘living’ God. Life, as  applied to God, . . . means that in God there are a heart and will, responsive to human need, an  attitude of mind that both evokes and answers prayer.” In the early 1960s King used similar  language in describing how his religious beliefs had changed during his years of civil rights activ-  ism; see King, Strepgth to Love (New York: Harper, 1963). pp. 141-142: “In the past the idea of  a personal God was little more than a metaphysical category that I found theologically and philo-  sophically satisfying. Now it is a living reality that has been validated in the experiences of every-  day life. God has been profoundly real to me in recent years. . . . So in the truest sense of the  Word, God is a living God. In him there is feeling and will, responsive to the deepest yearnings  of the human heart: this God both evokes and answers prayer.”  15.

Here  we have to do not with the union of absorption, but with a union that grows out  of reciprocal intercourse, a union of heart and will and intellect; and such a  union is possible only between personal beings. Only the personality of God  makes possible the union of communion with him.* 15 Apr  1955  God’s personality is also the presupposition of his goodness. There can be  no goodness in the true ethical sense without freedom and intelligence. Only  a personal being can be good. Wieman talks a great deal about the goodness  of God and so does Tillich to a lesser extent; but this is goodness in an abstract  impersonal sense, not in a genuine ethical sense. Goodness in the true sense  of the word is an attribute of personality.16  The same is true of love. Outside of personality loves loses its meaning.  Tillich speaks of God as being love. But it is not love in the full sense of the  word. Love, for Tillich, is just the dialectical union of opposites. Tillich’s use  of the word love is hardly different from the meaning given it by Empedocles,  who meant by “love” no more than the attraction of the elements for one  another.?  Wieman writes a great deal about the need for loving God. But we may ask,  How can one truly love an interaction? Wieman would reply that it is always  an interaction that we love. He affirms: “When I love Mr. Jones it is not Mr.  Jones in the abstract, but the fellowship of Mr. Jones. Fellowship is a kind of  interaction. . . . It is the interaction which generates love and is the real object  of love.”+ Now it is certainly true that the interaction generates the love, but  it does not follow from this that we love interactions. What we love deeply is  persons-we love concrete objects, persistent realities, not mere interactions.  A process may generate love, but the love is directed primarily not toward the  process, but toward the continuing persons who generate that process.L8 In  the words of H. H. Dubbs,  If God is to really be worthy of love, he must be more than a system of interac-  tions-he must be an object, an enduring object, who can enter into interactions.  A God who is merely interactions cannot really be love, so that religious devotion  cannot attach to him.§  * Knudson, DOG, 307. 17, 18.  t See Chap. 111, sec. 10.l’ 8 Dubbs, Art. (1g43),  t Wieman, Art. (ig3z)’, 260.  16. Knudson, Doctrine of God, p. 307: “His personality is also the presupposition of his good-  ness. There can be no goodness in the ethical sense of the term without freedom and intelligence.  In other words, only a personal being can be good. . . . Goodness is an attribute of personality.”  17.

Both concepts are too imper-  sonal to express adequately the Christian conception of God. They provide  neither the conditions for true fellowship with God nor the assurance of his  goodness.  3. The transcendence and immanence  of God  In a very real sense Wieman may be referred to as a prophet of God’s im-  manence. He never wearies of pointing out that God is within nature. This  emphasis grows out of his basic naturalistic position. As we have seen, Wie-  man holds that there is nothing more fundamental or elemental than events.  Everything that exists is either an event, an aspect of an event, or a relation  between or within events. This means that there are no floating transcenden-  tal principles which explain the world in terms of something outside the  world. Principles, descriptions, and explanations refer to events and their re-  lations (structures).*  Like everything else that exists, God is found within the natural order.  Whatever may be his several other attributes, his transcendence is not of the  noumenal or completely independent variety. Whatever transcendence he has  will be seen to arise out of his very immanence in the world of events.‘O  Tillich’s thought at this point has often been considered the direct antithesis  of Wieman’s. He has been interpreted as a neo-supernaturalist, who affirms  that God is above, before, and behind nature. As we have seen, Wieman him-  self so interprets Tillich’s thought. But a close scrutiny of Tillich’s view in this  respect reveals that he is probably as near the naturalistic position as he is to  the supernaturalistic. Tillich is forever revolting against the view that there is  a world behind the world. His aversion for supernaturalism is clearly brought  out in the following passage in which he answers Wieman’s claim that he is a  supernaturalist:  With respect to myself, I only need point to practically all my writings and their  fight against the “side by side” theology even if it appears in the disguise of a  “super.” The Unconditioned is a qualification of the conditioned, of the world  * See Chap. IV, sec. 1.19  ates the love, but I am afraid Wieman errs when he asserts that we always love interactions. . . .  No, what we love deeply is not these memories or expectations, it is the person who brings them  about-we love concrete objects, persistent realities, not mere interactions. . . . A process may  generate love, but the love is directed primady not toward the process, but toward the continuing  persons (concrete objects) who generate that process.” First set of ellipses in original.  19.

He is convinced that the Divine does not inhabit a transcendent  world above nature; it is found in the “ecstatic” character of this world as its  transcendent depth and ground.“  God’s immanence is also expressed in the fact that everything finite partici-  pates in being itself and in infinity. If this were not the case, everything finite  would be swallowed by non-being, or it never would have emerged out of  non-being. So in a sense Tillich is as zealous to preserve the immanence of  God as Wieman.  But this is only one side of Tillich’s thought at this point. His desire to  protect the majesty of God and his complex ontological analysis cause him to  stress the transcendence of God as much as his immanence. Indeed, at times  Tillich seems to stress the transcendence more than the immanence. It is at  this point that Tillich goes beyond Wieman, for Wieman is more impressed  with the immanence of God than the transcendence.  Tillich finds a basis for God’s transcendence in the conecption of God as  abyss. God is transcendent in the sense that he, as the abyss of being, tran-  scends every being and also the totality of beings-the world. God is beyond  finitude and infinity, insists Tillich. “There is no proportion or gradation  between the finite and the infinite. There is an absolute break, an infinite  ‘jump’.”? As we have seen, the abyss is the inexhaustible depth of God’s na-  ture. This is the unknowable side of God. In so far as God is abyss he is  unapproachably holy, infinitely distant from man.22  Interestingly enough, Wieman agrees with Tillich that there is an un-  comprehended element in God’s nature. Wieman speaks of “the uncompre-  hended reality of God’s total being.”$ Despite his insistence that God is a  knowable entity within nature, Wieman affirms that God is transcendent, “not  in the sense of being wholly unknown, but in the sense of being unknown  with respect to his detailed and specific nature.”§ In other words, Wieman  seems to be saying that although we have some knowledge of God, we can  never know his ultimate nature, Le., his “detailed and specific nature.” Wie-  man is attempting to stress a functional transcendence rather than a meta-  physical one.  * Tillich, Rev.

But there is a distinct dif-  ference in emphasis. Wieman’s attempt to be a thoroughgoing empiricist and  naturalist causes him to stress the immanence of God much more than the  transcendence. On the other hand, Tillich’s desire to protect the majesty of  God causes him to stress the transcendence of God much more than his im-  manence. This emphsis is so strong in Tillich’s thinking that he goes to the  extreme of saying that it is the abyss that makes God God. This is his way of  saying that it is God’s transcendence rather than his immanence that makes  him God.  Whenever Wieman and Tillich stress the immanence of God, they must be  commended. Such an emphasis sounds a much needed note in the face of a  supernaturalism that finds nature so irrational that the order of creation can  no longer be discerned in it, and history so meaningless that it all bears the  “minus sign” of alienation from The emphasis comes as a necessary cor-  rective to a supernaturalism that has overstressed the transcendence of God.  However, there is always the danger that in revolting against any extreme  view one will go the opposite extreme, failing to see the partial value inherent  in the former. It is possible, for instance, so to stress the immanence of God  that the truth in the doctrine of the divine transcendence will be completely  overlooked. This is what happens in the case of Wieman. In his attempt to  confront modern skepticism with a God who is immanent in nature, Wieman  leaves out many basic Christian principles that are preserved in the doctrine  of transcendence. God cannot be reduced to natural processes, because he is  the ground and creator of the natural order. To make God merely a process  in nature is to rob him of his divinity. If God is to be truly God, he must be  more than a behavior process; he must, in some sense, be above and before  nature. Wieman fails to affirm this because of his bias toward a naturalistic  philosophy which is alien to the spirit of Christianity.  There is an unnecessary ambiguity in Tillich’s thought concerning the tran-  scendence and immanence of God. On the one hand he speaks as a religious  naturalist making God wholly immanent in nature. On the other hand he  speaks as an extreme supernaturalist making God almost comparable to the  Barthian “wholly other.” In other words Tillich seems to stress the absolute  immanence of God on the one hand and the absolute transcendence of God  on the other. But it is hardly possible to reconcile these two views. If God is  absolutely immanent he cannot be absolutely transcendent, and conversely, if  he is absolutely transcendent he cannot be absolutely immanent. Even Tillich’s  dialectical principle cannot come to his aid at this point because the presup-  position of the dialectical principle is that there is a point of contact between  the “yes” and “no.” Tillich himself realizes this. In one of his most succinct  criticisms of Barth, Tillich writes: “A dialectic theology is one in which ‘yes’  23. Horton, “Tillich’s Role in Contemporary Theology,” p. 30: “[Barth and Gogarten] find  nature so irrational that the order of creation can no longer be discerned in it, man’s spirit so  perverted that the image of God is lost, history so meaningless that it all bears the ‘minus sign’ of  5 l6 alienation from God.” </p><div id="pagenum"><p>The Martin Luther King, Jr. Papers Project </p></div><div id="pagenum"><p>and ‘no’ belong inseparably together.

The basic weakness of Tillich at this point is that he fails to maintain the  tension between the transcendence and immanence of God which is necessary  for a meaningful theistic position. God must be both “in” and “beyond” the  world. If he is absolutely beyond, then he is not in; if absolutely in, then not  beyond; but remove the absolutely, and he may be both. The doctrines of  transcendence and immanence are both half-truths in need of the tension of  each other to give the more inclusive truth. 15 Apr  ‘955 are irreconcilably separated, and that is why this theology is not dialectic.” *24  4. The super-human character of God  Tillich and Wieman have at the forefront of their thinking a deep theocen-  tric concern. Both are convinced that God is the most significant Fact in the  universe. However much they disagree on the nature of God, they are at one  in affirming the significance of God. Both are convinced that man’s ultimate  devotion is due to God and God alone. Tillich expresses this idea in the asser-  tion that God is what ultimately concerns us. This ultimate concern is the  abstract translation of the great commandment: “The Lord, our God, the  Lord is one; and you shall love the Lord your God with all your heart, and  with all your soul and with all your mind, and with all your strength.”? This  ultimate concern is unconditional, total and infinite. For any preliminary con-  cern to be elevated to ultimacy, is for Tillich, the height of idolatry. It is also  the source of many tragedies. When something essentially partial is boosted  into universality, and something essentially finite is given infinite significance,  almost anything can occur.$ 25 Only God warrants man’s ultimate concern.  Like Tillich, Wieman feels that nothing should be placed before God. He  contends that man should give himself, all that he is and all that he desires,  all that he possesses and all that is dear to him, into the control of creative  good to be transformed in any way that it may require.§ He is convinced that  * Tillich, Art.

Tillich, Systematic Theology, p. 13: “Idolatry is the elevation of a preliminary concern to  ultimacy. Something essentially conditioned is taken as unconditional, something essentially par-  tial is boosted into universality, and something essentially finite is given infinite significance (the  best example is the contemporary idolatry of religious nationalism).” 517 </p><div id="pagenum"><p>The Martin Luther King, Jr. Papers Project </p></div><div id="pagenum"><p>15 Apr </p></div><p id="page">1955 the chief tragedies that befall man and his historic existence stem from man’s  tendency to elevate created good to the rank of creative good (God). Just as  Tillich sees the elevation of preliminary concerns to the status of ultimacy as  idolatrous, Wieman sees the elevation of created good to the rank of creative  good as idolatrous. Wieman feels that the best in Christianity is the reversing  of the order of domination in the life of man from domination of human  concern by created good over to domination by creative good (God).**‘j So  Wieman’s emphasis, like Tillich’s, is theocentric throughout.  This theocentric concern leads Tillich and Wieman to the further assertion  that God is not man. Both are averse to anything that smacks of humanism.  As we have seen, Tillich’s ontological analysis leads him to affirm that God  must not be confused with man in any sense. God as being-itself infinitely  transcends all beings. He is not a being, not even a “highest being” or a “most  perfect” being. He is the power of being in everything that has being.7  This idea is more concisely expressed in the assertion that God is the un-  conditional. The unconditional is not a section of reality; it is not an object  among objects. The unconditional transcends the distinction between subject  and object. Instead of God being an object for us as subjects, he is the prius  of the separation into subject and object, that which precedes the division. As  we have seen in the earlier part of the discussion, this prius of separation is  not a person. It is power, power of being.*a  All of this is Tillich’s way of saying that God infinitely transcends human  existence. He is convinced that there is a qualitative distinction between God  and man.  Wieman, like Tillich, never wearies of pointing out that God is super-  human. It is probably no exaggeration to say that Wieman’s objectivistic, re-  alistic, theocentric trend developed in opposition to religious humanism. He  feels that the deification of man is the pitiable absurdity man has ever perpe-  trated. He is convinced that the work of God is totally difference from the  work of man. The difference is not merely of degree or magnitude. It is a  difference of kind.$ So Wieman, like Tillich, sees a qualitative difference bel  * Wieman, SHG, 25, 26.  t See Chap. 111, sec. 2.27  $ This is one of the  points at which Wieman is  unalterably opposed to  Dewey. Man is regarded by Wieman as a passive  factor in the event from  which good emerges, so  that it is not really man  who clarifies and carries  forward the ideal. It is God, the creative event.  Dewey, on the other  hand, attributes the emer-  gence of value to the CO-  working of men plus  more general fact0rs.2~  26.

God operates in ways over and above the plans and </p></div><p id="page">purposes of man, and often develops connections of mutual support and mu-  tual meaning in spite of or contrary to the efforts of men.30  For all that Wieman and Tillich have said about the primacy of God over  everything else in the universe, we have nothing but praise. In spite of the  fact that we have found it necessary to raise some questions as to the adequacy  of their conceptions of God to speak to the deepest yearnings of the religious  soul, we do not in the least want to minimize the importance of their messages  as a cry against the humanism of our generation. They do insist that religion  begins with God and that man cannot have faith apart from him. They do  proclaim that apart from God our human efforts turn to ashes and our sun-  rises into darkest night. They do suggest that man is not sufficient to himself  for life, but is dependent upon God. All of this is good, and it may be a nec-  essary corrective to a generation that has had all too much faith in man and  all too little faith in God.31 15Apr  1955  5. The power and knowledge of God.  Tillich places a great deal of emphasis on the omnipotence of God. He  continually speaks of God as the power of being. The one word that stands in  the forefront of Tillich’s God-concept is the word power. Power is that which  makes God God. God is the underlying “ground” or “power” behind every-  thing that exists. God as power of being resists and conquers non-being. It is  because of this power to resist non-being that God warrants man’s ultimate  concern. As we have seen, Tillich does not mean by omnipotence that God  has the power to do anything he wishes. Nor does it mean omni-activity in  terms of causality. Omnipotence means, rather, “the power of being which  resists nonbeing in all its expressions.” *32  Unlike Tillich, Wieman places little emphasis on the power of God. As we  * Tillich, ST, I, 273. In  spite of his persistent  stress on the power of  God, Tillich places consid-  erable limitation on God’s  power in his conception of  God as “abyss”. There is a basic ambiguity in Tillich‘s  thought at this point. This  ambiguity is found in the  fact that Tillich’s language  and method suggest an  extreme absolutistic the-  ism, while his conception of God as “abyss” suggests  finitistic theism. This  phase of Tillich’s thought  will be discussed and  evaluated in the section  on God and evil.  30. Parts of this paragraph also appear in chapter 4; see pp. 459-460 and 462 in this volume.  31.

He emphatically denies that God is omnipotent.  If God has any power, it is the power of process or growth. Wieman writes:  Process is power. Activity is power. I do not know of any kind of power except  that of process, activity, movement, growth, fulfillment, on-going. The power of  God is the power of this growth.*  Wieman considers it quite erroneous to look upon power as “back of” the  process or growth, making it go from the outside. Power is one essential con-  stituent of the process of growth, which is  So Wieman would totally disagree with Tillich’s assertion that God is a sort  of reservoir of power that empowers every being that comes into existence.  Wieman, contrary to Tillich, emphatically denies that God is the underlying  “ground” or “power” behind everything that exists. For Wieman, God is only  the source of the good.  When it comes to the question of the omniscience of God, both Wieman  and Tillich are at one in refuting its traditional formulation. In traditional  theology omniscience is the faculty of a highest being who is supposed to  know all objects, past, present and future, and beyond this, everything that  might have happened if what has happened had not happened. Tillich looks  upon this interpretation of omniscience as absurd because of the impossibility  of subsuming God under the subject-object scheme. Wieman sees it as absurd  because there is not the slightest empirical evidence for the existence of such  a “highest being” who knows all objects, past, present, and future. It is Tillich’s  attempt to remain true to his ontological assertion that God is being-itself that  causes him to deny the omniscience of God. It is Wieman’s attempt to be a  thoroughgoing empiricist that causes him to deny the omniscience of God.  Despite his concurrence with Wieman on the absurdity of the traditional  doctrine of the omniscience of God, Tillich goes beyond Wieman by seeking  to set forth the qualitative and symbolic meaning of the doctrine. Herein lies  a great distinction between Wieman and Tillich on the attributes of God gen-  erally. Tillich, while rejecting the traditional meaning of attributes, seeks to  give them a qualitative interpretation and thereby to accept them-at least  symbolically. Wieman, on the other hand, finds the attributes out of harmony  with his naturalistic and empiricistic views, and therefore rejects them out-  right. This accounts for the fact that he nowhere gives a systematic treatment  to the attributes of God.  * Wieman, Art. (1936)*, 429.  33. Wieman, “God Is More,” p. 429: “To speak of power as ‘back of’ the process or growth or  activity, making it go from the outside, is an error, I think. . . . Power is one essential constituent  of the process of growth, which is God.” 520 </p><div id="pagenum"><p>The Martin Luther King, Jr. Papers Project </p></div><div id="pagenum"><p>The omniscience of God means, for Tillich, that ‘5 APT </p></div><p id="page">‘955 nothing is outside the centered unity of his life; nothing is strange, dark, hidden,  isolated, unapproachable. Nothing falls outside the structure of being. The  dynamic element cannot break the unity of the form; the abysmal quality cannot  swallow the rational quality of the divine life.*  This has tremendous implications for man’s personal and cultural existence.  In personal life it means that there is no absolute darkness in one’s being. The  divine omniscience is ultimately the logical foundation of the belief in the  openness of reality to human knowledge. We are able to reach truth because  the divine life in which we are rooted embodies all truth.?  We shall reserve critical comment on this phase of Wieman’s and Tillich’s  thinking until the section on the goodness of God.  6. The eternity and omnipresence  of God  On the questions of the eternity and omnipresence of God, Tillich again  gives clearer expression than does Wieman. Here, as in other instances, Wie-  man’s naturalism prevents him from going all of the way with Tillich. As we  have seen, Tillich affirms that two interpretations of eternity must be rejected,  that of timelessness, and that of endlessness of time. Rather than meaning  timelessness, eternity means “the power of embracing all periods of time.”$  The eternal keeps the temporal within itself by maintaining “the transcendent  unity of the dissected moments of existential time.”§ There is a similarity be-  tween the eternality of God and the eternality of a mathematical proposition.  A symbolic indication of the meaning of the eternity of God may be found  in human experience, in the unity of remembered past and anticipated future  in an experienced present. As the present is predominant in human experi-  ence, eternity is symbolized as an eternal present. But this present is not si-  multaneity. Simultaneity would erase the different modes of time. The eternal  present is moving from past to future but without ceasing to be In  this sense God is eternal in such a way that the distinctions within the flow of  time are preserved. So Tillich includes within the divine life both temporality  and eternality.  * Tillich, ST, I, 279.  t See Chap. 11, sec.  $ Tillich, ST, I, 274.  8 Tillich, ST, I, 274.  34.

Indeed his idea of God has been referred to as “extreme temporalistic the-  ism.”* His very definitions of God-“growth,” “creative event” and “pro-  cess”-point to something that is temporal and passing rather than eternal.  An event or a process of growth is neither a continuing entity nor a persistent  reality. It is something forever in a state of becoming. It is quite apparent that  Wieman’s characterization of God as “process” or “creative event” is due to his  desire to abandon the scholastic notion of substantial being. Like Whitehead,  he has preference for dynamic terminology. He seeks to stress the activity of  God as against a static ens necessarium, absolute Being.36 So, unlike Tillich,  Wieman is so determined to make God a temporal reality that he almost com-  pletely overlooks his eternity.  When it comes to the question of God’s omnipresence, both Tillich and  Wieman are at one in denying its traditional meaning. However, Tillich goes  beyond Wieman in seeking to interpret the attribute of omnipresence in  qualitative terms. God is omnipresent in the sense that he creates extension  out of his nature as ground and that he is the ground in which all space is  rooted. Space is in God, not God in space. So Tillich concludes that God can-  not be spatial, although he must be temporal.  Now a word of critical comment. Certainly Wieman and Tillich are on  sound ground in affirming the temporality of God. It is often supposed that  if God is nonspatial, he must be nontemporal. But this does not necessarily  follows. The two categories are sufficiently different to stand on their indi-  vidual footing. If God is a living God he must include temporality, and with  this a relation to the modes of time.  This stress on the temporality of God, however, must not obscure the fact  that there is some permanence in God’s nature. Herein lies the weakness of  Wieman. He stresses the temporality of God to the point of minimizing his  eternality. As stated above, Wieman’s characterization of God as “process” or  “creative event” is due to his desire to abandon the scholastic notion of sub-  stantial being. He seeks to stress the activity of God as against a static abso-  lute being. But this attempt to avoid one sort of abstraction, namely, one  which leaves out becoming, leads directly into another, namely, one that  * See Hartshorne’s and  Reese’s chapter on Wie-  man in PSG, 395-408.  36.

These are terms which Wieman employs to signalize the actuality of  God as against abstract form or ideal, and the activity of God as against a static em necessarium,  absolute Being.”  522 </p><div id="pagenum"><p>The Martin Luther King, Jr. Papers Project </p></div><div id="pagenum"><p>leaves out that which becomes3’ Tillich sees this and therefore attempts to </p></div><p id="page">preserve in God, at least symbolically, both dynamics and form, temporality  and eternality.”  Wieman’s temporalistic view of God comes as a proper revolt against a mis-  conceived and one-sided substance philosophy. But his whole doctrine of God  is weakened by his failure to emphasize the factor of permanence in the idea  of God. The religious worshiper is in quest of a God who is not only the  increaser of value, but also the conserver of value. We have seen how Wieman  continually identifies God with the production or emergence of values. Pro-  duction of value, we are told, is also destruction of value. New values displace  old. But what happens to these displaced values? Are they simply destroyed  as though they never existed? In this case all of man’s objectives must in the  long run prove futile.3s  Wieman would probably retort that values are conserved in works of art  and in many forms of conscious and unconscious memory. But what happens  when human life no longer inhabits the earth? Even if we concede that the  earth will be inhabitable forever-an astronomical impossibility-we still have  to confront the fact that the human attention span is too limited to house, at  any given human present, any appreciable proportion of the values of past  generations. So without an eternal conserver of values our efforts are worth-  less, and no act can in the long run have better consequences than any  In such a situation the rivalry of values is meaningless. In order for  value-experience to be meaningful, then, there must be a God eternal enough  to conserve values. God must be identified not only with the production or  emergence of values, but also with the indestructibility of them.* 15 Apr  1955  * Cf.

The goodness of God  The question of the goodness of God is one that stands in the forefront of  Wieman’s thinking. Tillich, as we have seen, is more impressed with the power  of God. For Tillich it is power that makes God God. But, for Wieman, it is  goodness or value that makes God God. These are the important words in  Wieman’s discussion of God. God is the “source of human good”; He is “su-  preme value.” Says Wieman: “I maintain . . . that the basic category for God  must be goodness and value.””  Wieman contends that God is the only absolute good. As we have seen, he  seeks to defend this claim by defining absolute in a fivefold sense.? First of all,  absolute good refers to that which is good under all circumstances and con-  ditions. It is good that is not relative to time or place or race or class or need  or desire. It is good that remains changelessly and identically the same. A  second mark of absolute good is that its demands are unlimited. God is good  in this sense because he demands our wholehearted surrender. A third mark  of absolute good is its infinite value. Fourth, absolute good is unqualified  good. Finally, absolute good is entirely trustworthy.  God’s goodness meets all these requirements. His goodness is not relative  to time or place or desire or even human existence. He demands our whole-  hearted surrender. His worth is incommensurable with any finite quantity of  created good. There is no perspective from which his goodness can be modi-  fied. God is entirely trustworthy. Wieman is certain that the outcome of the  working of God will always be the best possible under the conditions, even  when it may seem to be otherwise.  Wieman holds that God is supreme value because he brings lesser values  into relations of maximum mutual support and mutual enhancement. This  mutual support and enhancement is not only between contemporaries but  also between successive generations, ages and cultures. All of this is Wieman’s  way of stressing the fact that God is supreme value and the only absolute  Good.  Tillich, like Wieman, uses the terms goodness and value in referring to  God. In one passage he says:  The very fact that the one God is called “good” gives him a divine character  superior to that of the evil god, for God as the expression of man’s ultimate  concern is supreme not only in power but also in value.$  * Wieman, Art.

It would really mean that our efforts are worthless,  that no act can in the long run have better consequences than any other.”  40.

In his whole Systematic Theology one can hardly find a page  of references .in which Tillich affirms the essential goodness of God. Even  when the terms goodness and value are used, they are defined in terms of  being. Herein lies a basic difference between Wieman and Tillich. Wieman is  basically concerned with the goodness of God. Tillich, on the other hand, is  basically concerned with the power of God. Wieman’s basic emphasis is axio-  logical while Tillich’s is ontological.  Now we may give some critical comments on the questions of God’s power  and goodness as treated by Wieman and Tillich. In the judgement of the  present writer, both Wieman and Tillich are partially correct in what they  affirm and partially wrong in what they deny. Wieman is right in emphasizing  the goodness of God, but wrong in minimizing his power. Likewise Tillich is  right in emphasizing the power of God, but wrong in minimizing his good-  ness. Both Tillich and Wieman overstress one aspect of the divine nature to  the neglect of another basic aspect. God is not either powerful or good; he is  powerful and good. Matthew Arnold’s simple, almost trite, phrase con-  tains the gist of the matter: God is a power, not ourselves, making for righ-  teousness. Not power alone, nor righteousness alone, but a combination of  the two constitutes the meaning of God. Value by itself is impotent; being by  itself is morally indifferent. On the one hand, there is the view of Wieman  which erects the idea of value as the sole utlimate principle. On the other  hand, there is the view of Tillich which erects power or being-itself as the sole  ultimate principle. Neither viewpoint adequately formulates the Christian  doctrine of God.41  Wieman talks continually about the goodness of God. But one is forced to  wonder whether Wieman’s God is capable of bringing this goodness into be-  ing. As we stated above, value in itself is impotent. Hence a God devoid of  power is ultimately inacapable of actualizing the good. But if God is truly God  and warrants man’s ultimate devotion, he must have not only an infinite con-  cern for the good but an infinite power to actualize the good. This is the truth  expressed in the somewhat misleading doctrine of the divine omnipotence. It  does not mean that God can do the nondoable; neither does it mean that God  has the power to act contrary to his own nature. It means, rather, that God 15 Apr  1955  * Tillich, TPE, 27.  41. Demos, Review of Systematic Theology, p. 706: “Matthew Arnold’s simple, almost platitudi-  nous, phrase contains the gist of the matter: God is a power, not ourselves, making for righteous-  ness. Not power alone, nor righteousness alone, but the blend of the two constitutes the meaning  of God. Value by itself is impotent; being by itself is morally indifferent. On the one side, there is  Platonism which erects the Idea of the Good (Value) as the sole ultimate principle. On the other  side, there is the view of this book which erects beingness as the sole ultimate principle.

Moral perfection  would be an empty possession apart from a corresponding and sustaining  power. It is power that gives reality to the divine being. Wieman’s failure to  see this causes us to doubt the adequacy of his conception of God as a mean-  ingful theistic position.  One may well question the adequacy and significance of Tillichs statement  that God is being-itself. Everybody knows that there are existing things, and  if one wants to become more philosophical, one can go on and say that there  is an existing ground of the existence of everything. But this is saying little  more than the tautology that the universe exists. Every intelligent person ad-  mits that the universe is immense, infinite and awesome; but this does not  make him a believer. What one wants to know is whether the universe is good,  bad, or indifferent. It is the failure to grapple sufficiently with this question  that seriously weakens Tillich’s God-concept. It is true that Tillich uses the  terms goodness and value, but he defines these in terms of being. To be good  means to be. It will be recalled that Spinoza speaks of the perfection of the  universe, but defines perfection in terms of substance. So, too, Tillich speaks  of value, but defines it in terms of being. (We have noticed already that divine  love is declared to be a wholly ontological concept.)42  Tillich’s tendency to relegate value to an almost insignificant rank is clearly  manifested in his analysis of value-categories in relation to being-itself. Struc-  ture, according to Tillich, is derived from being-itself; in turn, value is derived  from structure. So to this point value is at a second remove from reality. But  this is not all; value-concepts presuppose the contrast between ideal and ac-  tualities, and hence a split between essence and existence.* In other words,  value is now a third remove from reality. Value-categories are relegated to the  realm of finite being.t43  * See Tillich, ST, I,  202-204.  t Cf. Demos, Rev.  (1952), 707.  42. Demos, Review of Systematic Theology, pp. 706-707: “One may well question what of genu-  ine significance there is in the author’s statement that God is being-itself. Everybody knows that  there are existing things, and if one wants to speak causally, one can go on and say that there is  an existing ground of the existence of everything. But this essentially amounts to no more than  the tautology that the universe exists. . . . All sensible people grant that the universe is grand,  infinite, immense, awesome; but this does not make them believers. What one wants to know is  whether the universe is good or bad or worse (i.e., morally indifferent). . . . It will be recalled that  Spinoza speaks of the perfection of the universe, but defines perfection in terms of substance.  So, too, our author uses the terms goodness and value (incidentally, how scanty are such refer-  ences in this book!) but then defines these in terms of being. (To be good means to be; we have  noticed already that divine love is declared to be a wholly ontological concept.)”  43. Demos, Review of Systematic Theology, p. 707: “Structure (meaning) according to the author  is derived from being-itself; in turn, value is derived from structure. Thus value is at a second  remove from reality. This is not all, however; value-concepts presuppose the contrast between 526 </p><div id="pagenum"><p>The Martin Luther King, Jr. Papers Project </p></div><div id="pagenum"><p>Tillich speaks continually of the holiness of God, but even here he is not </p></div><p id="page">endowing being-itself with moral perfection. The holy means the sacred, and  not the righteous or the morally good.*44  So in almost all of Tillich’s references to God it is power that stands in the  forefront. In a real sense, this emphasis is dangerous, because it leads toward  a worship of power for its own sake. Divine power, like any other power, can  become despotic power if it is not controlled by divine goodness. In short,  neither Tillich’s notion of being-itself, nor any other purely ontological notion  is adequate for the Christian idea of God. The latter is a synthesis of the two  independent concepts of value and being.45  We have quoted above two passages in which Tillich referred to the good-  ness of God. These passages reveal that he is at least aware of the significance  of the category of value for an adequate God-concept. But his definition of  God as being-itself prevents him from affirming it. He realizes that if he refers  to God as good, he thereby conditions the unconditioned, and drags God into  a subject-object relationship making him a being beside others. So in order to  be consistent with his ontological analysis, Tillich talks of God as being good  in the sense that he is the ground of goodness. This, however, gives rise to  the same criticism that was raised concerning the personal status of God. If  God is good only in the sense that he is the ground of goodness, it follows that  he is evil since he is the ground of evil. If the attribute of goodness means  anything it must have content and it must be a quality of some rational sub-  stance. To state that God is the ground of goodness is merely an abstraction.  One wishes to get behind this abstraction to an ontological substance in which  the attribute of goodness inheres. So here again we see the inadequacy of  Tillich’s being-itself for the Christian idea of God.  To sum up, neither Tillich nor Wieman gives and adequate conception of  God’s nature. The former places an undue emphasis on being to the neglect  of value; the latter places an undue emphasis on value to the neglect of being. 15 Apr  1955  * See Tillich, ST, I,  216-217.  ideals and actualities, and hence a split between essence and existence; they apply in the crea-  turely and finite world (pp. 202-204). In other words, value is at a third remove from reality.  Value-categories are relegated to the realm of finite being.”  44. Demos, Review of Systematic Theology, p. 707: “Professor Tillich speaks of God as holy. . . .  God is notjust pure being; he is a being endowed with moral perfection. But wait: the holy means  the sacred essentially; it stands in contrast with the ‘righteous’ or the ‘morally good,’ or with ‘moral  perfection’ (pp. P 16- 2 17).”  45. Demos, Review of Systematic Theology, p. 707: “All this seems to me dangerously roman-  tic-dangerous because it easily slips into a worship of power for its own sake. If we are tosave  divine power from becoming despotic power we must cling to the notion of the goodness of God  as an irreducible element in his essence. To sum up, neither the Thomistic notion of complete  actuality, nor the author’s notion of being-itself, nor any other purely ontological notion is ade-  quate for the Christian idea of God. The latter is a synthesis of the two independent concepts of  value and being.” 527 </p><div id="pagenum"><p>The Martin Luther King, Jr. Papers Project </p></div><div id="pagenum"><p>15 Apr </p></div><p id="page">1955 A more adequate view is to maintain that both value and being are basic in  the meaning of God, each blending with the other but neither being reduced  to the other.””  8. God’s creative activity  In traditional theology creation referred to the act whereby the underived  self-existent God brought into being what had no form of independent exis-  tence hitherto. So strong was the Christian, theistic belief in an absolute, tran-  scendent God who worked under no external limitation, that creation was said  to be ex nihilo, i.e. generation out of nothing. With this traditional concept  both Wieman and Tillich are in radical disagreement. Wieman contends that  the doctrine of creation ex nihilo is self-contradictory; moreover, it would be  impossible for Wieman on the basis of his method to get any knowledge of  such an initial generation, supposing it ever occurred. Tillich disagrees with  this traditional theory because it looks upon creation as an act or an event  which took place “once upon a time.” Creation, for Tillich, does not refer to  an event, it rather indicates a condition, a relationship between God and the  world.47  So, for Tillich, as for Wieman, there is no supernatural being before and  above all beings as their creator. Instead of being a supernatural creator, Til-  lich’s God is “the ground of Being.”” Tillich’s desire to place all theological  matter under the scrutiny of strict ontological analysis causes him to go be-  yond Wieman in interpreting the meaning of the traditional doctrine. Thus  he is able to find some meaning in the traditional doctrine of creation  nihilo. The phrase is taken to mean that God creates the world out of not-  being; hence human nature (and all nature) is constituted by not-being; natu-  * Ground, according to only symbolize through “substance” and “acci-  Tillich, is neither cause causation or substantiality. dents” lack the freedom  nor substance, taken liter- Literal causes always are with respect to each other  ally, but something “un- also effects, something which Christianity affirms  derlying” all things in a conditioned (whereas God both of God and of  manner which we can is unconditioned), while creatures.48  46.

We have al-  ready seen how Tillich uses all three modes of time to symbolize God’s creative  activity. All of this gives evidence of the fact that creation, for Tillich, does not  refer to an event; it is rather the word given to the process which actualizes  man in existence.  In spite of his rejection of the doctrine of creation ex nihilo, there is a sense  in which Wieman speaks of God as creator. God is the creator of all created  values. God is the sum-total of all the natural conditions of value-achievement.  Many problems arise from these analyses of God’s creative activity. The  basic problem in Wieman is whether or not he has raised more problems in  his denial of creation than he has solved. The basic problem in Tillich is  whether the man who is actualized in existence is properly “man” or “God”;  whether the view of Tillich is an ultimate monism or pluralism. These prob-  lems will be discussed in the next two sections. Suffice it to say at this point  that neither Wieman nor Tillich has taken seriously the scriptural witness to  God’s creation of man, God’s imparting to man a center of consciousness with  freedom and responsibility, a will with co-creative powers.* 15 Apr  1955  9. God and evil  Wieman looks upon the “problem of evil” as a false problem; it arises only  when one departs from the empirical evidence for God as “the good,” or the  chief factor for good in nature, and begins to speculate about God as also  something the creator of all existence. When the idea of God as creator is  relinquished, the problem disappears. The more empirical problem is to de-  fine the actual nature and scope of evil, and not to indulge in unempirical  speculation as to its origin. We have already seen above how Wieman takes  pains to describe the nature and scope of evil.?  This view of God is avowedly finitistic. God is only the source of good. He  is therefore limited by evil forces external to his nature. He is not the ultimate  ground of all existence because of the very existence of these evil forces. Wie-  man asks:  Why is God not the ultimate ground of all existence? Because he is not the ulti-  mate ground of murder, lust, treachery and all the horrors of existence. To try  to revere such a reality as God, is to try to initiate a religion that is worse than  voodooism.$  * Gen. i:27-31; 2:7-8; t See Chap. IV, sec. 3.4g  Psalms 8; Mark 12:30; Mt. $ Wieman, Art.

Tillich cannot dismiss the problem of evil as easily as Wieman, because of  his contention that God is the ultimate ground of all reality. As we have seen,  Tillich divides evil into three classes.* (a) Physical evil, pain, and death), ac-  cording to him, offer no real problem because they are natural implications  of creaturely finitude. (b) Then there is moral evil which is the tragic impli-  cation of creaturely freedom. (c) Finally, there is the apparent fact of mean-  inglessness and futility- and this, according to Tillich, is the only sort of evil  which offers genuine difficulty for theological belief. Tillich’s solution to the  problem of evil of this third sort is very difficult to understand, partly because  of its excessive conciseness. Such evil is described as “the negativities of crea-  turely existence.”5O  Tillich hints at another solution to the problem of evil. This solution is  found in his positing a nonrational aspect in God’s nature. This is set forth in  the concept of God as “abyss.” As we have seen, the abysmal nature of God is  a nonrational, unformed dimension of incalculable power.? There are two  aspects to God’s nature, viz., the and the abyss. The former is the ratio-  nal aspect and the latter is the nonrational. It is this nonrational aspect that  accounts for much of the evil in the world. So Tillich attempts to solve the  problem of evil by finding a nonrational aspect in God’s nature. Like Wieman,  he ends up with a finitistic view of God. His language and method seem ex-  tremely absolutistic, but his stress on the abysmal aspect of God’s nature is  definitely finitistic. Tillich’s finitism is to be distinguished from Wieman’s in  one significant respect: in Wieman’s conception the limitation of God’s power  is external to his nature, while in Tillich’s thought the limitation is an aspect  within God’s nature.  How adequate are these views? Wieman seeks to avoid the problem of evil  by a complete denial of creation. He holds to the finiteness of God, yet without  being subject to the criticism which may be directed against belief in a Crea-  tor-God. But the denial of a Creator-God raises more problems than it solves.  Such a denial gives no explanation of the source of consciousness and value.  Moreover, it fails to explain the unity of nature. This easy solution of the  problem of evil fails to grapple thoroughly with the problem of good. Its  impersonalism is philosophically inadequate.  Some questions may be raised concerning Tillich’s solution to the problem  of evil. At one point he says that physical evil offers no real problem because  it is a natural implication of creaturely finitude. But this is no solution to the  problem. Physical evils are surely evil, and the fact that they are implicated in  * See Chap. 111, sec. 5.  t See Chap. 111, sec. 4.5’  50.

This conception suf-  fers from all of the inadequacies of any ultimate metaphysical dualism. Tillich  leaves such a tremendous gap between God as abyss and God as loRos that  there hardly appears to be a point of contact between the two. Nowhere does  Tillich adequately explain the relationship of these two aspects of God’s na-  ture. So great is the mystery between the abyss and the loRos that one is com-  pelled to wonder why the two should be called 15 Apr  ‘955  io. The question of monism versus  pluralism  As we have seen above, Wieman seeks to maintain an ultimate pluralism in  which God is in no way responsible for evil. Wieman is emphatic in the asser-  tion that God is not the ultimate ground of all existence. He is probably one  of several ultimate realities.? 54 With this ultimate pluralism Tillich would not  concur. For Tillich God is the one ultimate reality, the ultimate ground of all  existence. Tillich, then, is monistic in his emphasis, while Wieman is pluralis-  tic. As we attempted to show above, Tillich’s monism is not only qualitative,  but also quantitative.$ Tillich holds to an ultimate ontological monism, both  qualitative and quantitative. God is ultimately the only metaphysical reality.  The life of man is a phase of the actualization of God and not a separate  metaphysical reality.  If there is any one point at which Wieman and Tillich are in basic disagree-  ment, it is here. Wieman holds to an ultimate pluralism, both quantitative and  qualitative. Tillich, on the other hand, holds to an ultimate monism, both  qualitative and quantitative.  Here again we find Wieman and Tillich each overstressing one phase of  * Cf.

Harold DeWolf, A Theology of the Living Church (New York: Harper, ig53), p. 134: “In  Tillich’s view the relation between God as abyss and God as logos is left so completely in mystery  that it is unclear why the two should both be called God.”  54.

Wieman is so impressed with manyness that  he overlooks oneness. Tillich, on the other hand, is so impressed with oneness  that he overlooks manyness.  Neither of these views is basically sound. Wieman’s ultimate pluralism fails  to satisfy the rational demand for unity. Sense-experience is manifold and  pluralistic; but reason is unitary and systematic. Monism, as Kant recognized,  is the deepest demand of reason. A unitary world-ground is implied in the  principle of causality. Moreover, there is system in this universe; cognition  would be impossible without it. Further, no ultimate system can be made up  of independent units. If the system be real, the units must be subordinated to  the system.*56  Certainly this quest for ultimate unity haunts the religious man. One of  the main things that the religious worshiper is seeking is a Being who is able  to reduce all multiplicity to unity. Wieman’s failure to discover this unity  leaves him with a conception of God that is both religiously and intellectually  inadequate.  As Wieman’s ultimate pluralism is unsatisfactory, so is Tillich’s ultimate mo-  nism. There is much in Tillich that is reminiscent of Spinoza and Hegel. In  each of these systems finite individuality is swallowed up in the unity of being.  Individual persons become merely transitory modes of the one substance,  having no substantial character of their own.  One of the greatest dangers of Tillich’s system is that it tends toward pan-  theism. This type of thinking makes God impersonal and breaks down the  separateness and independence of finite personality. In this sense it brings  havoc to true religion. True religion is not concerned about metaphysical  union of the human with the divine, but with a relation of mutual understand-  ing between them, a relation that expresses itself in worship and love. Such a  relationship is possible only between persons who maintain their distinct in-  dividuality. To make human personality a mere phase or mode of the absolute  is to render real religious experience impossible. Pantheism is both practically  and theorectically disastrous.  Tillich talks a great deal about the freedom of man. The most pervasive  idea in all of Tillich’s utterances about man is that man is free. In numerous  instances man’s nature is spoken of as “finite freedom.” He says: “Man is man  because he has freedom.”? Again he says: “Freedom makes man man.’’$57  * Cf. Knudson, POP, $ Tillich, Art.

We have seen how he tries  to maintain both, and thereby presents a contradiction which he never com-  pletely resolves. The fact is that freedom is nonexistent in a monistic system.  Freedom requires metaphysical otherness. But in a monistic system there is  no otherness on the part of finite persons. Finite beings are parts of the Infi-  nite or absolute and issue forth from its being by a kind of logical necessity.  In order for freedom to exist there must be distinct individuality and in-  dependence on the part of the finite soul. This the individual is deprived of  in a thoroughgoing monism. Such monism breaks down the exclusiveness of  personality, and erases the boundary lines between personal beings, making  the finite person simply a part of the absolute. All of this reveals the futility  of Tillich’s attempt to stress the freedom of man in his monistic system. When  taken in all of its logical implications, Tillich’s system provides no place for  finite freedom.  A final weakness of Tillich’s system, as with all monistic systems, is its failure  to grapple with the problem of error. It makes error as necessary as truth,  and thus leaves us with no standard that would enable us to distinguish be-  tween them and no means of using the standard if we had it.  To sum up, both Wieman’s pluralism and Tillich’s monism are inadequate  as philosophical and religious world-views. Each overemphasizes one phase  of reality while totally neglecting another important phase. Here again, the  solution is not either monism pluralism; it is both monism & pluralism.  Tillich and Wieman fail to see that both positions can be meaningfully main-  tained. It is possible to hold a quantitative pluralism while holding a qualita-  tive monism. In this way both oneness and manyness are preserved. Neither  swallows the other. Such a view defends, on the one hand, individuality  against the impersonalism and all-engulfing universalism of any type of ulti-  mate monism. On the other hand, it vindicates the idea of a basal monism  against the attacks of any ultimate pluralism. 15 Apr  1955  * Tillich, ST, I, 255.  58. Boozer, “Place of Reason,” pp. 62-63: “Man has in a sense left the divine ground to ‘stand  upon’ his own feet. He is to some extent ‘outside’ the divine life. ‘To be outside the divine life  means to stand in actualized freedom, in an existence which is no longer united with essence.”’  533 </p><div id="pagenum"><p>The Martin Luther King, Jr. Papers Project </p></div><div id="pagenum"><p>Chapter VI </p></div><p id="page">CONCLUSIONS  The following theses may be stated as conclusions drawn from this investi-  gation of the conceptions of God in the thinking of Tillich and Wieman.  1. Tillich’s basic and most persistent definition of God is “being-itself,” e~~e  ipsum. In affirming that God is being-itself, Tillich is denying that God is a  being beside other beings. In this conception he intends to convey the idea  of the power of being. God is the power of being in everything and above  everything.  2. Wieman’s basic definition of God is the “creative event.” This definition  is an amplification of what Wieman means when he speaks of God as growth.  He further defines God as “supreme value” and as “the unlimited connective  growth of value-connections.’’ But these definitions seem to have three differ-  ent meanings. When Wieman characterizes God as “supreme value” he seems  to mean the ideal of perfection or of the achievement of maximum value.  When he speaks of God as “the unlimited corrective growth of value-connec-  tions” he seems to mean the human and social processes which aim at the  achievement of value. When he describes God as the creative event he seems  to mean the natural forces underlying the achievement of value. These three  meanings cannot be viewed as constituting a unity except in a highly figurative  sense, and positively not for a religious philosophy which would be consis-  tently empirical. At this point Wieman has failed to be consistently empirical.  3. Both Tillich and Wieman agree that God is an undeniable reality. They  are so convinced of the reality of God that they would dismiss all arguments  for his existence as futile and invalid. They further agree in seeking to assure  the reality of God through the definition of God. But in attempting to for-  mulate the idea of God so as to make the question of his existence a dead  issue, Tillich and Wieman have given up much that is most essential from the  religious point of view in the idea of God. Both sacrifice too much for the sake  of getting rid of a troublesome question.  4. Both Tillich and Wieman deny the category of personality to God. They  think that to refer to God as a person is to limit him. This denial of personality  to God does not mean, they insist, that God is impersonal. Instead of being  impersonal or sub-personal, God is supra-personal. Despite their warnings  that God is not less than personal, however, we have seen traits throughout  their thinking that point to a God that is less than personal. Wieman’s God is  an interaction, that is, a behavior-process. He is not a concrete object or a  continuing entity. In short, he is an unconscious process devoid of any true  purpose. Tillich’s “being-itself’’ is little more than a sub-personal reservoir of  power. In this respect Tillich’s thought is somewhat akin to the impersonalism  of Oriental Vedantism. “Being-itself” is a pure absolute devoid of conscious-  ness and life.  5. Wieman’s naturalistic position causes him to place great emphasis on the  immanence of God. Like everything else that exists God is found within the  natural order. Whatever transcendence God has is seen to arise out of his very 534 </p><div id="pagenum"><p>The Martin Luther King, Jr. Papers Project </p></div><div id="pagenum"><p>immanence in the world of events. There is much in Tillich’s view that comes </p></div><p id="page">close to the naturalistic position. He revolts against the view that there is a  world behind the world. The Divine does not inhabit a transcendent world  above nature; it is found in the “ecstatic” character of &I& world as its tran-  scendent depth and ground.  6. Tillich’s desire to protect the majesty of God and his complex ontological  analysis cause him to stress the transcendence of God as much as his imma-  nence. He finds a basis for God’s transcendence in the conception of God as  abyss. There is a basic inconsistency in Tillich’s thought at this point. On the  one hand he speaks as a religious naturalist making God wholly immanent in  nature. On the other hand he speaks as an extreme supernaturalist making  God almost comparable to the Barthian “wholly other.”  7. Tillich and Wieman have at the forefront of their thinking a deep theo-  centric concern. Both are convinced that God is the most significant Fact in  the universe. This theocentric concern leads Tillich and Wieman to the fur-  ther assertion that God is not man. They see a qualitative difference between  God and man.  8. Tillich and Wieman are at one in rejecting the traditional formulations  of the attributes of God. Tillich goes beyond Wieman, however, by seeking to  set forth the qualitative and symbolic meaning of the attributes.  9. Tillich includes within the divine life both temporality and eternality.  Wieman’s stress is on the the temporality of God. His failure to emphasize  the factor of permanence in the idea of God weakens Wieman’s doctrine of  God at many points. It leaves a God who is the increaser of value without  being the conserver of value. In such a situation, value-experience becomes  meaningless.  io. The most important words in Tillich’s conception of God are “power”  and “being”. The most important words in Wieman’s conception of God are  “goodness” and “value.” Wieman’s basic emphasis is axiological while Tillich’s  is ontological. Now both Wieman and Tillich are partially correct in what they  affirm, but partially wrong in what they deny. Both overstress one aspect of  the divine nature to the neglect of another basic aspect. Tillich places an un-  due emphasis on being to the neglect of value; Wieman places an undue em-  phasis on value to the neglect of being. A more adequate view is to maintain  that both value & being are basic in the meaning of God; each blending  with the other but neither being reduced to the other.  1 1. Both Tillich and Wieman reject the traditional doctrine of creation. For  neither of them is there a supernatural being before and above all beings as  their creator.  12. Tillich and Wieman are theistic finitists. However, they differ in one  significant respect: in Wieman’s conception the limitation to God’s power is  external to his nature, while in Tillich’s thought the limitation is an aspect  within God’s nature.  13. Wieman holds to an ultimate pluralism, both quantitative and qualita-  tive. Tillich, on the other hand, holds to an ultimate monism, both qualitative  and quantitative. Both of these views have been found to be inadequate. Wie-  man’s ultimate pluralism fails to satisfy the rational demand for unity. Tillich’s  ultimate monism swallows up finite individuality in the unity of being.
