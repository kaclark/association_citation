In the general introductions to Plotinus’  philosophy, both of them usually lie either buried in the footnotes or hidden in the context between the lines. 1 This should be surprising, however, because  Plotinus makes number the primary activity of substance, which orders the unfolding of the universe from its absolute source into a ﬁ  nite multiplicity.  More important, number, as underlying the existence of Intellect and Being, i s  t h e  b u i l d i n g  b l o c k ,  s o  t o  s p e a k ,  o f  t h e  i n t e l l i g i b l e  r e a l m .  I f  n u m b e r  h a s  such a paramount ontogenetic role in the intelligible, it seems strange that it does not ﬁ  gure more prominently in all scholarly presentations of Plotinus’  architecture of the universe. I can ﬁ  n d  n o  r e a s o n  f o r  t h i s  o m i s s i o n  o t h e r   than to suspect that the concept has been simply overlooked, despite the red ﬂ  ags raised in more specialized studies of Plotinus’ ontology. This book,  therefore, aims at ﬁ  lling the current gap in the scholarship by demonstrating  the primary role of number in Plotinus’ philosophy and its signiﬁ  cance for  Porphyry’s organization of the Enneads. A perspicuous understanding of any Plotinian concept inevitably requires  a consideration of the subject from the Presocratics to the Neopythagoreans. I t  i s  p a r t i c u l a r l y  d i f ﬁ  cult to grasp Plotinus’ understanding of number,  because of the controversial nature of the concept in the philosophical tra- dition before him and especially because of Plato’s enigmatic view that the Forms are numbers. Historical and Philosophical Background The question of how to explain the overwhelming diversity in physical reality and the underlying principle of order in it is the foundation of ancient philoso-phy. The concepts of multiplicity and number are concomitant with the devel-opment of Greek philosophical thought itself. From the sixth century  B.C.E. to  1.

Very generally, the ancients conceived of the universe as a multiplicity  of material elements that are organized in a sense-perceptible way by intel- ligible principles. In these terms, one side of the above question is cosmo-g o n i c a l ,  a s  i t  s e a r c h e s  f o r  t h e  o r i g i n  o f  m u l t i p l i c i t y  f r o m  s o m e  p h y s i c a l  o r  metaphysical source. Another side is cosmological, as it searches for a way to explain the innumerable diversity of material world in an orderly fash-i o n .  Y e t  a  t h i r d  s i d e  o f  i t  i s  e p i s t e m o l o g i c a l ,  a s  i t  a t t e m p t s  t o  c o m p r e h e n d  the visible and invisible constituents of the universe in a rational form. The concepts of multiplicity and number seem to be innately related as a pair , if not completely of opposites, at least of opposite nature. Multiplicity denotes the innumerable, discrete, and continuous things that exist; number conveys the notion of limited, ordered, and deﬁ  ned multiplicity. The Pythagorean maxim that “all is number” best captures the philo- sophical background of the two concepts. 2 The understanding of the universe  as a unity of one and many begins with the early Presocratics’ search for the  primary originative substance ( archê ) as the source and the unifying element  of physical reality.3 Next, the Pythagoreans postulate that numbers orga- nize the universe in one harmonious unity, which is interwoven by unlimited (apeira ) and limiting ( perainonta ) elements. 4 Later philosophers said that Plato “Pythagorizes.”5 In the Metaphysics, Aristotle compares and distinguishes the philosophical views of Plato and the Pythagoreans. 6 According to him, the doctrines that numbers are the  causes of the substance of everything and that unity is a substance, not an attribute, of that which exists, are similar. The doctrines that numbers exist apart from the sensibles, that mathematical objects are an intermediate class between sensibles and nonsensibles, and that the indeﬁ  nite is a dyad “of great  and small,” are different. With the exception of the last pronouncement, as will be discussed at length later, 7 Aristotle’s list is quite accurate and has  inﬂ uenced the reading of Plato for all generations to follow. 2. Strictly speaking, Philolaus, in his later years a contemporary of Plato,  is the ﬁ  rst Pythagorean for whom we have written evidence for a doctrine of  numbers (Zhmud’ 1989 ). 3. Successively, the originative principle is water for Thales, the indeﬁ  nite  for Anaximander, and air for Anaximenes. 4.

The origin of Plato’s interest in Pythagoreanism and arithmogony is  not perfectly clear. It is clear, however, from Phlb. 16c5–10, that Plato consid- ers the Pythagorean cosmological view that everything which exists consists of one and many and has in its nature a conjunction of Limit ( peras ) and  Unlimited ( apeiria ) to be primary for the understanding of the universe.  He even compares the importance of Pythagoras’ teachings to Prometheus’  gift of ﬁ  re. 9 In the dialogue, Plato transforms Socrates’ initial perspective  that any generic unity (One) contains a deﬁ  nite number of “kinds” (Many)  “mediating between itself and the inﬁ  nity of particulars into which it ulti- mately vanishes”10 from logical into ontological. His search for the intelligible  paradigm that underlies physical reality originates from the Pythagorean view  that Limit “orders and ‘informs’ the unintelligible ‘chaos’ of the Unlimited (apeiron ).” 11 In addition to the Pythagorean cosmogonical and cosmological themes  in the Timaeus  and the Philebus,  the Parmenides  raises the ontological ques- tions of unity (one) and multiplicity.12 I t  i n v e s t i g a t e s  e i g h t  p o s s i b l e  w a y s ,   commonly known as hypotheses, of understanding the relationship between one and many, of which the ﬁ  rst two are considered to be of primary signif- icance for Plotinus’ ontology. The ﬁ  rst hypothesis ( Prm. 137c4–142a8) dem- onstrates that the unity of one ( to hen ) absolutely excludes any predicates and  therefore plurality, including even the predicate of being one, in a series of deductions, the most popular of which state that the one is not a whole and yet it does not have parts; it does not have a beginning nor an end, nor does it have shape or place; it is neither in motion nor at rest, and neither is it  8. The chronology of the works has been long debated and there is no  prospect of settling it soon. The general consensus, reached not too long ago  (Zeyl 2000 : xvi–xx), is that the dialogues belong to Plato’s later period. See  W. Guthrie ( 1978: vol. 5 ,241–244). 9.Phlb.16c5–10:Ye«n m¢n eﬁw ényr≈pouw dÒsiw, Àw ge  katafa€netai §mo€, poy¢n §k ye«n §rr€fh diã tinow Promhy°vw  ëma fanotãtƒ tin‹ pur€: ka‹ oﬂ m¢n palaio€, kre€ttonew ≤m«n ka‹  §ggut°rv ye«n oﬁkoËntew, taÊthn fÆmhn par°dosan, …w §j •nÚw m¢n  ka‹ poll«n ˆntvn t«n ée‹ legom°nvn e‰nai, p°raw d¢ ka‹ épeir€an §n aÍto›w sÊmfuton §xÒntvn. 10.

The Parmenides  predates, with more certainty, the Timaeus  and the </p><div id="pagenum"><p>Philebus .</p></div><div id="pagenum"><p>PLOTINUS ON NUMBER 6</p></div><p id="page">the same as, nor other than, itself. Exposing the self-contradictory nature of  the ﬁ  rst hypothesis, which denies even existence to a one, The Parmenides proposes a second hypothesis ( Prm. 142b1–151e2), which suggests that the  one consists of unity ( to hen ) and being ( ousia, to einai, and to on ). This  hypothesis allows the one to partake of being “which qualiﬁ  es it for a wide range of attribu tions considered in relation to other things, ” 13 thus implying  that being partakes of multiplicity. The ﬁ  nal result of the second hypothesis,  which is most important for our investigation, is that one, as unity, and mul- tiplicity interact at an ontological level, especially as represented in Plotinus’  concepts of the Indeﬁ  nite Dyad and Intellect.14 In Plato’s so-called unwritten doctrines ( agrapha dogmata ),15 the con- cepts of one and many crystallize as the principles of all things: a One and an Indeﬁ  nite Dyad. 16 The two principles are in the foundation of Platonic  metaphysics and shape the interpretation of Plato’s written works by both Platonists and Peripatetics. The immediate successors of the Academy, Speusippus and Xenocrates, face the challenging and yet inspiring task of explicating the meaning of Plato’s ﬁ  rst principles in light of Aristotle’s criti- cism in Metaphysics  M and N that numbers are not beings and do not have  intelligible substance. Speusippus renames Plato’s principles of a One and an Indeﬁ  nite Dyad  as a One and Multiplicity ( plêthos ) and reﬁ  nes the derivation of beings from  t h e m  i n t o  a  s y s t e m  t h a t  i s  b e s t  d o c u m e n t e d  i n  I a m b l i c h u s ’  De Communi  Mathematica Scientia  (Comm. Math. ) chapter 4 , if we accept, with Dillon  and Merlan, 17 Speusippus’ authorship. According to this system, the ﬁ  rst  level of reality that derives from the union of a One and Multiplicity is the ﬁ rst principle of number, which in turn unites with multiplicity once again  13. Sayre ( 1996 :271). 14. The subject of chapter 3 . 15. The debate over the relationship between Plato’s written works and  his “oral unwritten doctrines” is ceaseless. Although I am sympathetic with  Krämer’s position ( 1990 :177) that the direct and indirect Platonic traditions  “have a reciprocal relationship” and are “in agreement and partly coincide, partly complete one another,” I believe, with Dillon ( 2003 : viii), this relationship to be  more “ﬂ  uid and developmental.” For a detailed survey of the issue, see  W. Guthrie ( 1978: vol. 5 ,418–442). 16. Simplicius, In Metaph .187a: “ Alexander says that ‘according to Plato  the One and the Indeﬁ  nite Dyad, which he spoke of as Great and Small, are the  Principles of all things and even of the Forms themselves.’ . . . It is very likely  that Plato made the One and the Indeﬁ  nite Dyad the Principles of all things,  since this was the doctrine of the Pythagoreans whom Plato followed at many  points.”</p><div id="pagenum"><p>17.

In this process,  oversimpliﬁ  ed here, the One imposes limit and quality onto Multiplicity,  being inﬁ  nite divisibility. As will be analyzed at length in chapter 3, Aristotle  interprets multiplicity quantitatively as multiplicity of units and number as a  composition of units, while Speusippus and, in retrospect, Plato view them as ontologically primal. 18 Speusippus’ successor as the head of the Old Academy, Xenocrates,  understands the two ﬁ  rst principles as the Monad and the Dyad. The former  is characterized as male and Intellect, the latter as female and an Indeﬁ  nite  Dyad containing multiplicity ( plêthos ) and unlimitedness ( apeiria ).19 From  the union of these two principles derives a World Soul, which is the “cre-ative repository of the Forms, and projector of them onto the physical plane.” 20 The metaphysical schemes of Speusippus and Xenocrates construct,  v e r y  m u c h  i n  t h e  m a n n e r  o f  P l a t o ’ s  Philebus,  the universe as a product of  the imposition of Limit onto the Unlimited. Although they adopt Plato’s two ﬁ rst principles, they take opposite views of the place of the Forms in their  systems. In this respect, Aristotle’s summary of the Platonic positions on the issue has gained the popularity of a “purple passage” in every book on the history of philosophy and deserves to be mentioned in this survey too: “some [sc. Plato] recognize these as two classes—the Forms ( ideas ) and the math- ematical numbers ( mathêmatikous arithmous )—and others [sc. Xenocrates]  r e g a r d  b o t h  a s  h a v i n g  o n e  n a t u r e  ( mian physin amphoterôn ), and yet others  [sc. Speusippus] hold that only the mathematical substances are substances (mathêmatikas monon ousias einai ).” 21 Aristotle adds Plato to the rift between  Speusippus and Xenocrates on the issue of the relationship between the Forms and numbers in order to compose the big picture of the debate. Speusippus’ radical rejection of Plato’s Forms in favor of numbers as the ontological real-ity that fashions the material world is not so much a conceptual negation of Plato’s Forms as it is an aftermath of the difﬁ  culty of the problem itself.  Perhaps forced by Aristotle’s avid criticism, Speusippus decisively makes numbers to be the intelligible paradigm of the universe. Xenocrates, in his turn, perhaps in response to Speusippus’ position, takes a moderate path by arguing that the Forms and numbers have the same nature, that is, have ontological value. For Aristotle, of course, the ontological relation between the Forms and numbers is an insurmountable stumbling block because, for him, numbers have only arithmetical and quantitative value. Aristotle’s position  18.Metaph .1085b; see chapter 3 . 19. Plutarch, De Procreatione Animae 1012d–1013b and De Defectu  Oraculorum 409e. Dillon ( 2003 :99). 20.

The conﬂ  ation of the universal order and the concept of number, and  the ensuing debates thereon, shape the course of Middle Platonism and lead to the revival of Pythagoreanism in the ﬁ  rst and second centuries, 22 result- ing in the Neopythagorean teachings of Moderatus, Nicomachus, Numenius, and Ammonius Saccas. Unfortunately, the paucity of biographical infor- mation about them and the fragmentary nature of their extant works,  with the exception of Nicomachus’ Arithmetica Introductio (Ar.),  present  a major obstacle not only for understanding their views but also for eluci-dating Plotinus’ immediate philosophical background. In Vita Plotini (VP), Porphyry emphasizes that the originality of Plotinus’ thought surpasses the philosophical acumen of his Neopythagorean predecessors or contemporaries. 23 As chapters 1 and 2 will demonstrate, the Neopythagorean inﬂ  uence on  Plotinus’ concepts of number and multiplicity is crucial, if not absolutely  vital. Both Moderatus and Nicomachus coin deﬁ  nitions of number that lie  in the foundation of Plotinus’ view of multiplicity and its dynamic state of  unfolding and enfolding. In the third century, Plotinus stands at the important crossroads of  conﬂ uent and sometimes conﬂ  icting inﬂ  uences of Platonic, Neopythagorean,  and Aristotelian thought.24 As a devoted Platonist and a student of the  Neopythagorean Ammonius Saccas, Plotinus, while rejecting Aristotle’s quantitative view of number, is naturally inclined to give numbers a more prominent ontological role in the structure of the universe.  Plotinus’ Philosophy, Concept of Number, and  Ennead VI.6: Difﬁ  culties Before the difﬁ  culties with Plotinus’ concept of number and Ennead VI.6 are introduced, it may be helpful to sketch, in broad strokes, the big picture  of his philosophical system. Plotinus conceives of the universe as a unity- in-multiplicity that is hierarchically ordered by three underlying principles of existence ( hypostases ). The ﬁ  rst principle is the One—itself simple, completely  uniﬁ ed, nondiscursive, supranoetic, the single source from which everything  exists. The second principle is Intellect, containing the intelligible principles  22. All dates refer to the Common Era unless noted otherwise. 23.VP17–21. Discussed in chapter 2. 24. The debate on whether the Forms are numbers very much shapes  Aristotle’s criticism of Platonic philosophy and his (usually acerbic) relationship </p><div id="pagenum"><p>with Plato’s immediate successors Speusippus and Xenocrates. </p></div><div id="pagenum"><p>INTRODUCTION 9</p></div><p id="page">of physical reality. Intellect comes into existence by contemplating the One  and by comprehending itself as homogenous multiplicity that possesses one and the same nature. The third principle is Soul, which translates the intel-ligible principles into sense-perceptible reality. Soul is also a principle of multiplicity, but it has a heterogeneous nature. Parts of it pertain to the intel-ligible realm, and parts of it associate with the material realm. These three hypostases organize the multiplicity of the universe in one uniﬁ  ed organism  that unfolds from and enfolds to its source, the One. According to Plotinus, this one-in-many nature of the universe is best  un d e r s t oo d  o nl y  thr o u g h  co n t e m p l a ti o n .  In  th e  tr ea ti s e  o n  n a tur e  an d  co n -templation (III. 8), he artistically makes nature itself describe its origin from  and existence in contemplation ( theôria ) :  “ A n d  m y  a c t  o f  c o n t e m p l a t i o n   makes what it contemplates, as the geometers draw their ﬁ  gures while they contemplate. But I do not draw, but as I contemplate, the lines which bound bodies come to be as if they fell from my contemplation. ” 25 The mathemati- cal content of the comparison immediately invokes Plato’s elaborate concep-tual use of arithmetic and geometry as intermediate tools in studying the higher level of reality. But the impelling simplicity of the image also reveals the principal difference of how Plato and Plotinus use mathematics. While Plato, as illustrated by the examples in the preceding section, 26 uses mathe- matics with deliberate and painstaking precision, Plotinus uses it with what  Armstrong has called “intuitive spontaneity,”27 which entails not numerical  precision but an intellectual and spiritual ﬂ  i g h t  o f  a b s t r a c t i o n .  T h e  i m a g i - nary sphere on the front cover of this book is constructed according to the different aspects that Plotinus conceives as constituting number in the intel- ligible. It visualizes geometrically the “unﬁ  gured ﬁ  gure” of the intelligible  whose elements, he argues, have ontological and not quantitative meaning. 28 As the sphere is not a result of someone who drew the lines but is an expres-sion of the mathematical formula written in the graphing program, so does number in the intelligible realm provide the blueprint for its quantitative expression in physical reality. Unfortunately, Plotinus’ contribution to the concept of number has  been often omitted, if not even ignored. It is not reasonable, however, to lay all the blame for the obscurity of the concept on its difﬁ  culty or Plotinus’  seemingly disorganized presentation of his philosophy in the Enneads,  for  there is not an easy concept in Plotinus, nor has his style hampered the  25.

The main reason for this omission, I suggest, is that Plotinus does not treat the subject of number in the Enneads  as pervasively as, let us say, the  Neopythagoreans, or even as his own successors, Iamblichus, Syrianus, and  Proclus. Nevertheless, a close examination of the Enneads  reveals Plotinus’  systematic discussion of number in relation to each of the three hypostases.  Particularly focusing on the role of number in the putting together ( systasis ) of the intelligible realm ( kosmos noêtos ), 29 he anticipates the subject of VI. 6 twice in the Enneads. In the treatise which explains that the intelligibles are not outside of  Intellect (V. 5),30 Plotinus announces the approach of VI. 6 with the remark  that “if there are any difﬁ  culties about [the concept of number], they will  be addressed later” (V. 5.4.38).31 In the treatise on the Platonic primary kinds  (VI.2), a second remark assures the reader that the properties of num- ber and magnitude “will be discussed later” (VI. 2.13.31).32 In his thematic  arrangement, Porphyry places VI. 6 to succeed immediately the treatises on  the primary kinds of being (VI. 2–VI.3) ,  a s  i f  t o  a c k n o w l e d g e  f o r m a l l y  t h e   association of number with the intelligible realm. The ﬁ  rst remark (in V. 5) connects VI. 6 with the treatises explicating the core of Plotinus’ metaphysics  and thus identiﬁ  ed as the Großschrift  (III. 8, V.5, V.8, and II. 9).33 The second  remark (in VI. 2) thematically links the treatises on the nature of the intelli- gible with the last two treatises in the collection, devoted to the One.34 This  arrangement suggests that number relates being to the One and VI. 6 brings  together the core treatises and the last treatises of the collection. Since VI. 6 has long had the reputation among scholars of being obscure  and difﬁ  cult, Plotinus’ concept of number takes, as mentioned earlier, a back- s e a t  i n  N e o p l a t o n i c  s c h o l a r s h i p .

In this, I stand in the same ﬁ  eld with Losev, who poetically justiﬁ  es  his in terest in th e con cep t o f n um ber b y admi ttin g that h e d oes n o t choose “only the strawberries, not even only the ﬂ  owers” of ancient philosophy, but  is interested in “all the grass and the fertilizer upon which the strawberries and other ﬂ  owers of philosophy grow.” 37 The fates of Plotinus’ concept of number and Ennead  VI.6 have changed  since their black-and-white phase in the nineteenth century, in which the two were either denigrated or exalted. Krämer , Szlezák, O’Meara, and Horn  each in turn have discussed the topic in chapters within larger frameworks, 38 while Charles-Saget, and Nikulin have elucidated it as a part of a broader  historical and comparative study of the concept in late antiquity and early  modern philosophy.39 Y e t so m e thin g is l e ft t o be d es ir ed . T o da t e , n o co m - prehensive analysis of Plotinus’ concept of number alone has been published.  Charles-Saget examines it in the shadow of Proclus’ elaborated theology of number. Nikulin traces the conceptual development of number from Plotinus to Descartes. The two studies, on the one hand, deservedly ascribe to Plotinus’ understanding of number a prominent place in the history of post-Platonic metaphysics. On the other hand, since the subject is consis-tently treated as a part of other topics, they give the erroneous impression that the concept of number in Plotinus can be grasped ﬁ  rmly only in relation  to his successors’ more advanced views. Yet, as I demonstrate in this work,  Plotinus’ conception of number is the fundamental framework on which his  entire philosophical system is built. This premise requires a comprehensive  35.

It should also be noted that the concept of  number is not discussed at any length, save a few lines, in his study.

Chapter Synopsis This study offers the ﬁ  rst comprehensive analysis of Plotinus’ concept of  number alone, beginning from its origin in Plato and the Neopythagoreans and ending with its inﬂ  uence on Porphyry’s arrangement of the Enneads. Its goals are to examine the Platonic and Neopythagorean contexts in which  Plotinus develops the concept; to demonstrate that the concept is at the foundation of Plotinus’ deﬁ  nition of the universe as multiplicity, and thus  bears paramount signiﬁ  cance for understanding the intelligible realm; to  reveal Plotinus’ contribution to the defense of Plato’s Ideal Numbers against  Aristotle’s persistent criticism; to show that Plotinus is the ﬁ  rst post-Platonic  philosopher who purposefully and systematically develops what we may call  a theory of number, distinguishing between number in the intelligible realm and quantitative mathematical number; and ﬁ  nally, to draw attention to  Plotinus’ concept as a necessary and programmatic link between the Platonic  and later Neoplatonic doctrines of number. The book contains six chapters, and, unlike the arrangement of the  Enneads  by Porphyry, the numerical symbolism is unintended. I begin by  investigating the origin of Plotinus’ cosmology in the Timaeus  and end by  examining the signiﬁ  cance of the concept for Porphyry’s arrangement of the  Enneads.  It is a curious, but telling, fact for the Plotinian introspective order  of the topics of each chapter that my ﬁ  rst interest in the subject started from  the last chapter, dealing with Porphyry’s arrangement of the multiplicity of the treatises according to number. I successively moved to the role of number in the intelligible realm, to Plotinus’ defense of Plato’s ontological view of num-ber against Aristotle’s criticism, to Plotinus’ understanding of multiplicity, and ﬁ  nally to the Neopythagorean and Platonic background of number. This  introspective order has allowed me to study the concept in the most Plotinian f as hi o n , I be li e v e, beginnin g wi th th e p h ys i cal a p pearan ce o f n um be r in th e multiplicity of the treatises and systematically peeling away the conceptual layers until reaching the Platonic core of Plotinus’ understanding that the universe is multiplicity separated from the One according to substantial num-ber. This multiplicity is uniﬁ  ed, divided, and circumscribed into existence by  number, and therefore this universe is one by virtue of number. This chapter arrangement presents the subject more suitably to our ana-</p><div id="pagenum"><p>lytically trained minds, but, above all, it follows Plotinus’ explanation of the universe from the inside out, that is, from its source to its periphery. With this arrangement, I hope to show that my examination of Plotinus’ concept of number is a book that is also one by number .</p></div><div id="pagenum"><p>INTRODUCTION 13</p></div><p id="page">The ﬁ  rst chapter examines the Platonic origin of Plotinus’ presentation  of the universe as multiplicity separated from the One. He uses the term  “separation” ( apostasis ), which stands in stark opposition to Plato’s account  of the Demiurge’s composition of the universe as “composition” ( systasis ) in  the Timaeus.  The two terms characterize the top-down approach in VI. 6 and  the bottom-up approach in the Timaeus.  Although the antithesis between the  two terms does not stem from any conceptual opposition between Plotinus  and Plato, it raises the question of the relationship between Plotinus’ cosmol- ogy in VI. 6 and Plato’s cosmogony in the Timaeus.  A close examination of  the two works reveals that Plotinus bases his deﬁ  nition of apostasis precisely  on Plato’s account of the composition of universal order ( tou kosmou systasis ) in the Timaeus.40 Both terms express the notion of motion and otherness in  the origin and organization of the universe. The two works achieve the same goal, the explanation of the universe, with the same means—according to  number—but from opposite starting points. The missing conceptual link between the two approaches, I suggest, is  found in Numenius’ concept of the Three Gods, ordering the universe: the  Father, the Maker, and the Creation. The characteristics of Numenius’ First God convey the dichotomy between rest, as being and stability, and motion, as change, in the ﬁ  rst principle. The explicit paradox of ontological stabil- ity (stasis ) and innate motion ( symphytos kinêsis ) in Numenius’ First God is  implicitly present in Plotinus’ explanation of the origin of the universe as apostasis.  This discovery further warrants the examination of the ﬁ  rst sepa- ration from the One and the origin of Intellect. The term apostasis  denotes  the cosmological process in which the universe exists as multiplicity abiding in different degrees of separation from the One. The major conclusion of this chapter is that Plotinus induces the concept of multiplicity as a measurement of the ontological distance from the One, which opens the possibility for stronger Neopythagorean inﬂ  uences. Chapter 2 investigates the Neopythagorean roots of Plotinus’ concept.  Porphyry’s numerous reports of his teacher’s involvement with Neopythagorean circles, and especially with Numenius and Ammonius Saccas, 41 do not require  much searching throughout the Enneads  to be validated. Numenius’ inﬂ  uence  on the deﬁ  n i t i o n  o f  m u l t i p l i c i t y  a s  apostasis demonstrates the central role  Neopythagorean views play in Plotinus’ cosmology. The notion of stability and motion in the origin of multiplicity also  characterizes Moderatus’ deﬁ  n i ti o n  o f  m a th e m a ti ca l  n u m b e r  a s  a  s y s t e m  o f   monads ( systêma monadôn ) ,  w h i c h  e i t h e r  p r o g r e s s e s  ( propodismos plêthous ) from the ﬁ  rst monad into multiplicity or regresses ( anapodismos plêthous ) 40.Ti.32c5–6.</p><div id="pagenum"><p>41.VP3,14,17–21.</p></div><div id="pagenum"><p>PLOTINUS ON NUMBER 14</p></div><p id="page">from multiplicity to the ﬁ  rst monad.42 He further distinguishes between the  monad as the principle of numbers ( tôn arithmôn archê ) and the one as the  principle of enumerated things ( tôn arithmêtôn archê ).43 This distinction leads  to a number of questions about Moderatus’ inﬂ  uence on Plotinus’ two kinds  of numbers; about Plotinus’ use of the mathematical deﬁ  nition of number in  the formation of the outward and inward directions of the existence of mul- tiplicity; and about Moderatus’ doctrine of three separate Ones as underlying principles of existence and Plotinus’ hypostases. After examining these ques-tions, I conclude that Plotinus views multiplicity as nothing else but number that preserves it from dissipating into inﬁ  nity and nonexistence. The prominent Neopythagorean overtones of Plotinus’ concept of mul- tiplicity and the origin of the universe as separation from the One compel  an examination of the difference between numbers, which are related to the intelligible realm, and quantitative numbers, which enumerate things. For Plotinus, this difference directly exposes Aristotle’s misconception of the Indeﬁ  nite Dyad, not as a principle of potentiality of existence in the intelli- gible, but as the actual creator of quantitative numbers. The third chapter, therefore, analyzes Plotinus’ refutation of Aristotle’s criticism of the Platonic view of number. By rejecting any quantitative value of number in the intel-ligible, Plotinus speciﬁ  cally focuses on Aristotle’s inability to understand the  Monad and the Indeﬁ  nite Dyad as the principles of creation and order of the  intelligible realm. The postulate that number lies at the ontological foundation of the  universe characterizes the early Pythagoreans and, later, Plato as well. Aristotle, in his turn, advocates the rejection of the ontological value of num-ber in the construction of the universe, thus partially causing the Middle  Platonic and Neopythagorean conceptual uprising in Plato’ s defense. Also in chapter 3, I show that Plotinus not only follows the steps of his Platonic and  Neopythagorean predecessors in defense of Plato’s position, but ingeniously  uses Aristotle’s ideas in arguing that number in the intelligible is activity and a property of primary substance. The result is an original and ontologically elaborate theory of substantial number ( ousiôdês arithmos ), which fulﬁ  lls two  major purposes: ( 1) it offers a new and more successful defense of Plato’s  “true numbers” against Aristotle’s persistent criticism; and ( 2) it explains  the relationship between substantial nonqualitative number and arithmetical quantitative number as that between intelligible paradigm and its material copy. 42.

Based on the distinction between sub- stance ( ousia ) as ontological actualization of beings and quantity ( posotês ) as  the numerable count of individual units, Plotinus conceptualizes a similar division for number itself. Contrary to Aristotle and in support of Plato, he conceives of two kinds of number: substantial number ( ousiôdês arithmos ) that  is “itself by itself,” which is the activity ( energeia ) of substance and a power  (dynamis ) of being; 44 and monadic number ( monadikos arithmos ), which sim- ply enumerates individual things.45 A s  a n  a c t i v i t y  o f  s u b s t a n c e ,  s u b s t a n t i a l   number enacts the limiting role of the Monad, while as a power of sub-stance, substantial number enacts the role of the Indeﬁ  nite Dyad as potenti- ality that is limited into existence by the Monad. As a property of substance,  number is the productive power and activity of substance. While substantial number actualizes the existence of that which has separated from the One in the intelligible, monadic number expresses quantitatively that which has been already deﬁ  ned by substantial number in the intelligible. In this light,  substantial number is the intelligible paradigm of monadic number. As the  former determines the existence of multiplicity in the intelligible, so does the latter preserve sensible multiplicity from dissipation in inﬁ  nity. Mathematics  and the numerability of individual things use monadic numbers. To explain the nature of substantial number, Plotinus deﬁ  nes Absolute  Being as uniﬁ  ed number ( arithmos hênômenos ) ,  I n t e l l e c t  a s  n u m b e r  m o v i n g   in itself ( arithmos en heautôi kinoumenos ), beings as unfolded number ( arith- mos exelêligmenos ), and the Complete Living Being as encompassing number  (arithmos periechôn ). 46 Number identiﬁ  es the primary property of substance  in every aspect of the intelligible realm. As such, substantial number acts as a principle ( archê ) constituting Intellect. In due order, chapter 5 analyzes  the ontological meaning of the above deﬁ  nitions. Their closer examination  reveals that the four aspects of substantial number correspond to the primary kinds of rest, movement, otherness, and sameness respectively. Heinemann, O’Meara, and Horn have noted the similarity between the structure of the intelligible in VI. 6 and the Platonic primary kinds ( megista genê ) in VI. 2–VI.3 and have interpreted it differently. Heinemann just acknowledges the rela-tionship between the treatises. 47 O’Meara concludes that the correspondence  44.

This does not mean that the number of the material copies of  something is limited to its substantial number, but that the overall number of  material things is limited to the number of all intelligible beings. 46.

T h i s  c o n c l u s i o n  a l s o  e l u c i d a t e s  t h e  r e l a t i o n s h i p  o f  s u b s t a n t i a l  n u m b e r  w i t h  the One and Soul, as Plotinus does not identify them with a particular prop-erty of number. Since the properties of substantial number order Intellect on the inside and since both the One and Soul stand on the outside of Intellect, they do not inherit a particular property of number. Substantial number is an ontological expression of the One “beyond Being,” which does not pos-sess any particular characteristic. Soul, however, as an image of Intellect, possesses all the properties of substantial number. The world soul encom-passes the sphere of the universe in its dance according to the paradigms of substantial number, while the individual soul expresses the nonquantitative substantial numbers in quantitative monadic numbers. Chapter 6 examines the relationship between Plotinus’ concepts of num- ber and multiplicity, and Porphyry’s organization of the Enneads.  Porphyry’s  thematical arrangement of the Enneads  is traditionally considered to be  more detrimental than beneﬁ  cial for understanding Plotinus’ thought. This,  I think, is an issue that is worth reexamining. Perhaps there is something more than personal eagerness and Neopythagorean numerical extravagance that inspired Porphyry’s organization of the works in six groups of nine according to his notorious “perfect ratio of six and nine” ( VP24). That  Porphyry publishes the collection in a particular numerical arrangement may e v e n  b e  m o r e  s i g n i ﬁ  cant for the later Neoplatonists’ attempts to overcome  the limitations of discursive thought. 50 In the Neopythagorean tradition, the  n u m b e r  s i x  i s  c o n s i d e r e d  t o  b e  t h e  ﬁ  rst perfect number and the hexad is  identiﬁ  ed as the n umber of Soul.51 F urthermore, the completion of the uni- v e r s e  i s  r e p r e s e n t e d  b y  t h e  n u m b e r  n i n e ,  w h i c h  i s  “ c a l l e d  ‘ e n n e a d ’  a s  i f  i t  were the ‘henad’ of everything within it, by derivation from the ‘one.’ ” 52 The  individual treatises are consequently grouped in nines, because they enclose the numerical essence of the universe from henad  to ennead . As number is  the constituting element of the existence of Being, Intellect, and Soul, so  48. O’Meara ( 1975:82–83). 49. Horn ( 1995b: 169). 50.

Plotinus’ Concept of Number and Ennead  VI.6: Content and Form Often in the Enneads,  individual treatises deal with a particular subject that  has come up during lectures in the school.53 Sometimes the treatises form  natural groups of works on the same topic, such as IV . 1–IV.5 examining ques- tions about soul or VI. 1–VI.3 dealing with the primary kinds of being. The  reality of Plotinus’ thought, however, is that any given concept is referred  to and discussed throughout the entire collection. A study of a Plotinian concept is grounded originally in a particular treatise, then gradually builds relations with other concepts and treatises, and inevitably engages the entire collection. Consequently, a recent trend in Neoplatonic studies is to evalu-ate a speciﬁ  c treatise in the context of the entire collection. 54 This approach  merges the boundaries separating the chronological from the thematic orga- nization of the Enneads  and provides an integrated contextual analysis of the  trea tise as bo th an in di vi d ual w o r k an d a part o f th e ﬁ  fty-four treatises. T o  defend this unitary approach, D’Ancona Costa draws a comparison with the traditional attitude toward the works of Plato and Aristotle: Again, a look at the contemporary scholarship on Plotinus suggests that the main strategy in approaching his philosophical thought consists in dealing wi th single treatises, dev oting to them a careful textual and philosophical analysis in precisely the same way as to a P latonic dialogue or an Aristotelian treatise. This fact sho ws on i ts own account the abandonment of the two hidden assumptions that made scholars in the past refrain from considering late Platonism as a proper philosophical subject matter, namely, its picture as a coun-terfeit of Plato’s thought, and its interpretation as a barely deductive a priori chain whose ultimate principle escapes rational analysis. 55 An y  m od e rn  s tu d e n t  o f  la t e  an ci e n t  p hil oso p h y  i s  n o  s tran g e r  t o  thi s  s e n ti -ment, although the passage refers speciﬁ  cally to the disparity of the scholarly  approach to Neoplatonic works in the past. 53.VP5.59–64. 54.

The latter is more popular among studies of a certain Plotinian concept, rather than a particular treatise. 56 The  goal of this section of the introduction is to broaden the unitary approach to include the importance of the relationship between a particular concept and  a particular treatise. The two concepts of multiplicity and number are discussed throughout  the Enneads,  but VI. 6 is speciﬁ  cally devoted to them. Porphyry lists the trea- tise with the title “On Numbers” and makes it the ﬁ  fty-ﬁ  rst treatise in his  thematic arrangement, 57 thus placing it among the most difﬁ  cult topics for  discussion pertinent to the One. O’Meara has examined the thematic prox- imity of VI. 6 with the treatises on the primary kinds of being (VI. 1–VI.3).58 To u nderl i ne t h is sig n i ﬁ  cance, I would also point out the placement of VI. 6 in the sixth Ennead. It follows the treatises on the kinds of being (VI. 1–VI.3) and on the presence of being everywhere (VI. 4–VI.5) and immediately pre- cedes the thematicly culminating point of the collection—the treatises deal-ing with the One (VI. 7–VI.9). In this ascending sequence, VI. 6 is the formal  link between the treatises on the nature of the intelligible and those on the One. As we will discover later, this thematic arrangement is conceptually and iconically justiﬁ  ed since substantial number as an ontological expression of  the One gives existence to the intelligible. As a result, both the treatise and  the concept of number prove to be of crucial importance for understanding Plotinus’ universe. The chronological sequence of the Enneads  also demonstrates the impor- tance of VI. 6. The treatise is the thirty-fourth on Porphyry’s list ( VP5) and  immediately succeeds the Großschrift,  which includes III. 8 [30], “On Nature  and Contemplation, and the One”; V. 8 [31], “On the Intelligible Beauty”; V. 5 [32], “That the Intelligibles Are Not Outside the Intellect”; and II. 9 [33],  “Against the Gnostics.” 59 According to VP5.35, Plotinus wrote the Großschrift and VI. 6 in Rome with the encouragement of his long-time disciples,  Porphyry and Amelius.

The novelty of the concept of three underlying principles, germi-nating in the Neopythagorean doctrines of the second and third centuries, perhaps stimulated Plotinus to espouse in writing his own understanding of the bondlike organization of the universe. The four treatises explicate the core of Plotinus’ metaphysics. That  these references relate speciﬁ  cally to the exegesis of multiplicity and number  in VI. 6, however, deserves a closer look. The discussions of contemplation  in III. 8, knowledge in V. 8.5–6, the origin of multiplicity in V. 5.4–6, and the  r e f u t a t i o n  o f  t h e  n o t i o n  t h a t  m u l t i p l i c i t y  i s  e v i l  i n  I I . 9 anticipate the main  topics of VI. 6. The four treatises in the Großschrift,  although chronologically succes- sive, are also organized thematically in such a way that their topics ascend the path taken by Soul (and by the philosopher’s mind) 60 to reunite itself  with Intellect and the One. This path, Armstrong observes, is twofold.61 The  ﬁ rst path, ascending from Soul to the One, is laid out in the ﬁ  rst Großschrift treatise (III. 8). The other path, ascending from Intellect to the One, is the  subject of the second and third treatises (V. 8 and V . 5). The last treatise (II. 9), written immediately before VI. 6, concludes the theme of ascent by refuting  the Gnostic anti-Platonic arguments against a single uniﬁ  ed being, generat- ing and transcending the noetic cosmos.62 Th e th e ma ti c co nn ecti o n o f VI . 6 with the Großschrift  s u gges ts tha t w e  should take the treatise more seriously and reevaluate its place in the Enneads, since VI. 6 continues the major themes of the Großschrift  and answers the  questions that it has left unanswered. VI. 6 repeats the thematic organization  of the Großschrift on a smaller scale. The composition of the work conspic- uously unfolds in a circular fashion, as noted by Charles-Saget, but omitted by Krämer and O’Meara. 63 The beginning of the treatise, like the awake Soul  in III. 8, explores the origin and existence of multiplicity in the intelligible  realm. The ﬁ  rst chapter deﬁ  nes multiplicity and inﬁ  nity. Chapters 2 and 3 60. The philosopher who has transcended sense-perception and “has  already ﬁ  nished reasoning” (III. 8.6.36–38). 61. Armstrong ( 1988 : vol. 5 ,152). 62. Seeking a more appropriate, thematic, arrangement of the treatises,  Porphyry bisects V. 5 [32] and II. 9 [33] and places them in the ﬁ  fth and the  second Enneads  as they deal respectively with the intelligible realm and physical  reality. Perhaps the fact that II. 9 defends the goodness of the physical reality  against the Gnostic doctrines that it is evil is the reason for which Porphyry  severs this part of the text and places it in the second Ennead , dealing with  topics related to material world. 63.

Chapter 9 is the cen- ter of the treatise, outlining the participation of number in every intelligible  entity. Chapters 10–16 refute once again Aristotle’ s polemics on number and  also summarize the constitutive role of substantial number in the intelligible;  chapter 17 brings back the discussion of the “number of inﬁ  nity,” introduced  in chapters 2 –3; and chapter 18  concludes the investigation of how multiplic- ity ascends to the transcending One by closing the discussion of multiplici-ty’s descent in chapter 1 . The structure of VI. 6 is symmetrical and self-contained, integrating  concentrically the concept of multiplicity with the focal discussion of sub-stantial number. It can be schematized as in ﬁ  gure 1. Multiplicity begins  and ends the thematic composition of the treatise. This circular arrangement iconically brings Plotinus’ examination of number to a full closure. As mul-tiplicity unfolds from the One and enfolds to the One, so does the composi-tion unfold and enfold itself like nesting circles, moving away from and yet turning toward their center. This circularity originates from Plotinus’ under-standing of the nature of discursive thought itself, which he compares to “many lines which proceed from one center” in order to “lead to a notion of the multiplicity which has come to be.” 65 The composition of VI. 6 also con- veys iconically the “self-turning attention” of Plotinus’ train of thought, as if the subject ( skemma ) of his thought produced the scheme ( schêma ), Greek  pun intended, of the universe it contemplates. 66 Contrary to Brisson, who views the central chapters of the treatise as a  long digression that answers the questions posed in the ﬁ  rst three chapters,67 I think the concept of number is so well ingrained in the composition of the  treatise that its rationale naturally follows the narrative of the treatise. In fact, Charles-Saget reproduces the commentary on VI. 6 edited by Bertier  et al. as an equally analytical part of her study of mathematics in Plotinus  and Proclus. 68 My own interest, pursued elsewhere, in how the literary form  of philosophy provides the framework for understanding the philosophi- cal concepts it presents has led me to study the composition of VI. 6 in the  64.Metaph .1083b36–1084a1. 65.

This exegesis displays  the elegance of Plotinus’ thought, despite the accusation, often deserved, of  obscurity and disparity. The concentric composition of VI. 6 conveys nondis- cursively the higher ontological presence of number in the intelligible realm  and iconically sketches the spherical ﬁ  gure of the universe. It also illustrates  perfectly Bréhier’s statement that “the image, in Plotinus, is not an external ornament but an integral element of the thought.” 70 The relationship between  VI.6 and the concept of number reveals a less intimidating and more attrac- tive side of Plotinus’ style and demonstrates how rewarding it is to examine the interplay between form and content in the Enneads. I have taken advantage of this rare example of symbiosis between liter- ary form and philosophical content and have followed the progression of the treatise to construe Plotinus’ concept of number, instead of straightening the course of his argument in favor of our modern analytical taste. As a result, this book does not offer a commentary on VI. 6, but rather an analysis of  Plotinus’ composition of the universe according to number as presented in VI.6 and all the Enneads. 69.

Oftentimes a term has a number of different  meanings depending on its context. I have followed the convention of capi-talizing the One, Intellect, and Soul, when they denote the underlying prin-ci p les o f existence, the hypostases.  When they are not capitalized, they refer  to an individual one, being, intellect, and soul. I have also capitalized Monad, Indeﬁ  nite Dyad, and Complete Living Being when Plotinus uses them as  proper names. Like everyone who has faced the challenge of Plotinian “living” thought, I have tried to grasp the precise semantic nuance of a particular usage, but I must admit that I cannot claim with absolute conﬁ  dence that I have always been successful. Finally, as often is the case with any term in Plotinus, kosmos  has a num- ber of different meanings depending on the speciﬁ  c context. It can refer to:  (1) the universe as a whole as acted upon by the principle of order; ( 2) the  universal order determining the individual place of everything in the grand scale of things; or ( 3) the two conceptual planes that distinguish collectively  all intelligible beings from their material copies. In order to minimize as much as possible the polysemous complexity of the term, I have used “uni-verse” when I have referred to Plotinus’ idea of the entire cosmos ( 1 above),  which includes both the intelligible realm ( kosmos noêtos ) and physical reality  (kosmos aisthêtos ). When I have discussed either of the two planes separately  (3 above), I have used respectively “intelligible realm” and “physical reality.”  I have kept Plotinus’ original term kosmos  only when I have had in mind the  principle of universal order ( 2 above). Following the deﬁ  nition of multiplicity ( plêthos ) in VI. 6, I have called it  multiplicity to express Plotinus’ use of the term as a collective noun, concep-tualizing the ordered existence of everything other than the One, as opposed to his use of polla  as “many,” which denotes a multitude of particular units  without an explicit notion of order. Translating the Enneads  is an equally Herculean task. But this time we  can claim that it has been accomplished with greater success. Armstrong’s translation of the complete text of the treatises in seven volumes in the Loeb series ( 1966–1988) has withstood the test of many a mind and has deservedly  won its authoritative place. Thus I have used his translations as the basis of the quotations in the text, with appropriate and sometimes substantial modiﬁ  ca- tions. The readership of the Enneads  is expanding with the new series Plotin:  Traités,  edited by Luc Brisson and Jean-François Pradeau. I believe the appear- ance of VI. 6 in print in this series is another testament to the timeliness and  importance of the subject of this book. The Greek text is according to P. Henry and H.-R. Schwyzer, Plotini Opera, 3 vols. (Clarendon Press 1964 –1983) and it </p><div id="pagenum"><p>is used without transliteration only in the footnotes to quote the original text </p></div><div id="pagenum"><p>INTRODUCTION 23</p></div><p id="page">of a translation or to illustrate a point that has already been made in the main  body of text. A few words are in order about the way in which the Enneads  are cited.  In general, there are two conventions of referring to a speciﬁ  c treatise. The  ﬁ rst identiﬁ  es the number of the Ennead  and the number of the treatise in  this Ennead.  For example, the treatise “On Numbers” is cited as VI. 6, which  means Ennead  VI, treatise six. The other contains the above information but  adds in brackets the number of the treatise according to the chronological order given by Porphyry in VP 4–6. Thus, Enn.  VI.6 [34] indicates that  this is the sixth treatise in the sixth Ennead  and that the treatise is number  thirty-four on Porphyry’s chronological list. There is no speciﬁ  c distinction  of when one way is preferred to the other, but the common trend recently favors the former and I have observed it throughout this book. Plotinus on Number  is intended to serve experienced as well as develop-</p><div id="pagenum"><p>ing scholars pursuing research in Neoplatonism, ancient philosophy, or the history of mathematics in general. It is hoped that the book will be of inter-est to those who study the development of ancient cosmology and the history of the concepts of One and Many in late antiquity.</p></div><div id="pagenum"><p>241</p></div><p id="page">Platonic Cosmology on Plotinian Terms Ennead  VI.6 and the Timaeus Plotinus’ cosmology begins where Plato’s cosmogony ends. In the Timaeus, Plato explains how the Demiurge “brings together that which is visible and  in disorderly motion” into universal order ( tou kosmou systasis, Ti. 32c.5–6).  In VI. 6, Plotinus expounds that the universe is a separation from the One  (apostasis tou henos,  VI.6.1), which organizes everything into a ﬁ  nite  cosmos.  The Timaeus  presents, in an ascending order, the composition ( systasis ) of  the primordial matter by the Demiurge into an image as close as possible to a perfect intelligible model, whereas VI. 6 constructs, in a descending  order, the universe as dianoetically successive separation ( apostasis ) of Being,  Intellect, the Complete Living Being, and Soul from a suprametaphysical  starting point. 1 Both works explicate the construction of the universe, but  from opposite ends. While it is obvious that the antinomy of the terms composition ( systa- sis) and separation ( apostasis ) does not stem from a conceptual opposition  between Plato and Plotinus,2 I would argue that Plotinus’ view of multiplicity  itself demands reversing the order of the cosmological account in VI. 6. Since  the One, as the ultimate source of existence, is “beyond being,” the universe can exist only as a result of the emanating power of the One. 3 Everything  must descend from and depend upon the One.4 Thus, if VI. 6 is going to  deal with the construction of the universe, it must employ the top-down  approach. In an article on the revival of Neoplatonic studies at the end of the last  century, Gerson concludes that “Plotinus’ consistently ‘top-down’ approach provides a most provocative alternative to the ‘bottom-up’ approach, precisely  1. This cosmogonical act is atemporal and aspatial. Our inability to  comprehend it nondiscursively forces us to talk about it dianoetically as  separating, unfolding, descending from the One (IV. 3.30, V.1.11, V.8.9) or to  represent it ﬁ  guratively as a center and its circle (V. 1.11). 2.

Plato and Plotinus share the same goal, but the differ-ence in their approach lies in whether they see the glass as half empty or half full. In the Timaeus,  Plato does not observe what is in the glass but rather vac- uum, because the primordial elements are in disorder, while in VI. 6 Plotinus  explains what is actually in the glass because every postcosmic element is in its ordered ontological place. The ﬁ  rst approach has difﬁ  culty explaining the  interactions between the glass contents, while the second approach elucidates the derivation of the elements ﬁ  lling the glass. In V. 8.7, Plotinus dismisses the  bottom-up approach because he ﬁ  nds the preconception of the ﬁ  nite universe  impossible. 7 Arguing from an ontological, not epistemological, standpoint, he  claims that one cannot think up the universe with all its elements together, unless one perceives that all things exist in something else from which they  derive. The “nesting” explanation of the derivation of the universe lays the  foundation of the top-down approach. This chapter therefore examines how the top-down approach converts  the systasis of the Timaeus  into the apostasis  in VI. 6 in particular and Plato’s  cosmogony into Plotinus’ cosmology in general. Subsequently, this analysis searches for the roots of Plotinus’ understanding of the origin of the universe as a separation from the One in Plato’s cosmogony in the Timaeus  and in the  Neopythagorean notion of the First God as stasis. Enn.  VI.6 is not usually associated with Plotinus’ cosmology as II. 1 is,  for example, because it does not deal with the standard cast of ancient cos-mology: the four primary elements, the heavens, the physical reality, and the soul. 8 Inst ead , i t postula t es tha t th e uni v erse is a resul t o f th e separa ti o n o f  multiplicity from the One and that this separation is conducted according to intelligible number. While II. 1 strictly follows the traditional Platonic explana- tion of the universe, VI. 6 conﬂ  ates Platonic cosmogony and Neopythagorean  numeric theory to produce a truly Plotinian account focusing on the deri-v a ti o n o f tha t w hi c h e xists from tha t w hi c h is be y o n d e xist en ce . 9 Naturally,  5.

Thematically, II. 1 presents Plotinus’ exegesis of the orthodox Platonic  cosmology, whereas VI. 6 focuses exclusively on the post-Platonic view of the  universe as a derivation and “other” from the One.10 Discussing Plotinus’ cosmological exegesis in VI. 6, both Charles-Saget  and Nikulin neglect to recognize the conceptual communication of the trea-tise with the Timaeus. 11 Most recently, however, in his preface to the transla- tion of VI. 6, Brisson calls Plotinus “un disciple ﬁ  dèle du Platon du Timée,”12 a  statement that deserves, I think, a serious consideration. The treatise conveys Plotinus’ understanding of the structure of the universe, namely, the architec-ture of the intelligible realm according to number. The strong cosmological tones of VI. 6 demand that we turn our attention to the Timaeus  ﬁ rst. 13 We often forget that the cosmogony in the Timaeus  begins on a less per- fect note. It starts from the primeval material chaos, which brings a thematic culmination to the catastrophic end of Atlantis, and ends with the creation of cosmic order, discernible even in the organization of the human body. 14 Scholars tend to use the original-and-copy analogy in presenting Plato’s view of the physical world as a phenomenological expression of the Forms. While this method suits his ontology well, it obfuscates the fact that the cosmogony of the Timaeus  is an upward progression from the image to its original, from  sensible matter to the Forms. Plato’s cosmogony begins with the Demiurge’s perception of the disorderly state of everything that is corporeal and visible. 15 Through his inherent goodness, the Demiurge brings the precosmic matter  10. II.1 is the fortieth treatise in Porphyry’s chronological order ( VP5) and  thus succeeds VI. 6, which is number thirty-four. Both treatises belong to the  middle period of Plotinus’ writing, characterized by Porphyry as “the acme of  Plotinus’ ability” ( VP6.33). 11. While Charles-Saget ( 1980 :9–17) examines the place of the treatise in  the Neopythagorean tradition, Nikulin ( 2002 ) is interested in the post-Plotinian  development of the concept. 12. Brisson ( 2006 :289). 13. Aside from Phillips, who analyzes ( 1997:173–197) the Neoplatonists’  answers to the question of the eternity of the cosmos in the Timaeus,  the  relationship between Plotinus’ view of the origin of the universe, especially as presented in VI. 6, and the Timaeus  has not been yet examined. 14.

Plutarch interprets the  disorderly precosmic state as animated by the World Soul and as an aspect of the Indeﬁ  nite Dyad, De Generatione Animae in Timaeo 1014b, as John Dillon pointed </p><div id="pagenum"><p>out to me.</p></div><div id="pagenum"><p>PLATONIC COSMOLOGY ON PLOTINIAN TERMS 27</p></div><p id="page">into order by “putting intelligence into soul, and soul in body” ( Ti.30b4–5) so that he creates an imperfect image of the perfect intelligible paradigms  he contemplates. The bottom-up approach explains the physical reality as a c o p y  o f  th e  F o rm s  b y  p u t t i n g  i t  t o g e th e r  a s  i f  ﬁ  lling the empty half of the  glass with order and identity. Plato builds the systasis  of the universe upon motion, which is at the  basis of the existential polarity between the Forms and their material copies. To recall the famous deﬁ  nitions of being ( to on ) and becoming ( to gignom- enon), the Forms are ontologically perfect constants (“that which always is  and has no becoming”), while their copies are materially imperfect variables (“that which becomes and never is”). 16 The Forms are eternal, perfect, atem- poral, motionless, and therefore not subject to change, whereas the physical world is originated, imperfect, temporal, constantly in motion, and therefore  subject to change. 17 In the Timaeus,  motion characterizes the universe in its precosmic and  postcosmic stages. First, there is the discordant and disorderly motion of the  precosmic elements, which the Demiurge brings into order.18 Second, in cre- ating the model of the Complete Living Thing ( to zôon noêton ), the Demiurge  makes motion inherent in the nature of the World Soul. In the composi- tion of the World Soul, he uses the Same, “which is indivisible and always  changeless,” the Different, which is “divisible and comes to be in the material world,” and the Mixture of the Same and the Different ( Ti.35a). The ﬁ  rst  two parts are completely opposite to each other, while the third, contain-ing elements of both, acts as their intermediary. Because, in this sense, the nature of the World Soul is heterogeneous, the difference in the nature of its elements creates motion and therefore change. For this reason, the Demiurge regulates and orders the motion of the World Soul in strict numerical propor-tions as he shapes it in the perfect form of a sphere ( Ti.36a–37d). Third, the  Demiurge’s ﬁ  nal touch in the creation of the ordered universe is the creation  of time as a quantiﬁ  able physical image of eternity ( Ti.37d). He channels the  disorderly motion of primordial mass into the orderly existence of a ﬁ  nite uni- verse by giving it “a distinct conﬁ  guration by means of shapes and numbers”  16.Ti.27d6–28a1. Cf. Parmenides, fr. 8.3–6 and 25 –38 and fr. 8 .39–41, respectively. 17. Plato contradicts himself in Sph. 248e–249b by arguing that the Forms  do not lack intelligence, change, movement, and life. Scholars have a hard time  resolving Plato’s inconsistency. Cornford ( 1935:244–247) suggests that Plato has  both intelligible and physical reality in mind. But I do not think we have seen the end of the debate. Motion is one of the principal characteristics of Intellect,  see the discussion of substantial number and Intellect in chapter 5. 18. Respectively, Ti.30a4–5,kinoÊmenon plhmmel«w ka‹ étãktvw and </p><div id="pagenum"><p>Ti.30a5, eﬁw tãjin aÈtÚ ≥gagen §k t∞w étaj€aw .</p></div><div id="pagenum"><p>PLOTINUS ON NUMBER 28</p></div><p id="page">(Ti.53b4–5).19 As a result, the Demiurge’s induction of proportions and num- bers converts Plato’s cosmogony into cosmology.20 While for Plato, in the Timaeus,  the universe is a composition ( systasis ) of the primordial mass in an order, for Plotinus, in VI. 6, the universe is a  separation ( apostasis ) of everything from the One into order. The universe is  a one-in-many unity of different degrees of ontological stability that derive  by emanation in a successive order from the One, beyond Being, to Intellect, comprising all intelligible beings, to Soul, the lower part of which brings l i f e  t o  p h y s i c a l  r e a l i t y .  A t  ﬁ  rst glance, the opening chapter of the treatise  has a strong cosmogonical sense, underlining the stark difference between  the beginning of the Timaeus  account and Plotinus’ conception of the origin  of the universe. Paradoxically, it seems that Plato and Plotinus attribute the structure of the universe to opposite processes. There is no primordial disor-der in Plotinus’ construction of the universe. Instead, there is only an onto-logical orderly procession of everything that exists from the One. 21 While  Plato’s account is about putting the universe together as an image of the perfect intelligible paradigms, Plotinus’ account is about unfolding the uni-verse from the absolute Good and the One. 22 It seems that Plotinus begins  his account of the composition of the universe from the point at which Plato leaves it off. Origin of Multiplicity in Plotinus Before dealing with any speciﬁ  c cosmological details as in II. 1, Plotinus must  work out the most important point of any cosmogonical theory, the begin-ning of existence. Now is the time to clarify that this beginning is only a  dianoetic expression conveying the relationship between the One and the  19. Cornford’s translation ( 1935:198). The reference to Plato’s account of  the creation of time and numbers ( Ti.37d–39e and 47 a) suggests that Plotinus  has the Timaeus  in mind in VI. 6. 20. In Cornford’s words ( 1935:31), “the cosmology is cast in the form  of cosmogony , a ‘story’ of events spread out in time. ” This idea is overall  underplayed by Wilberding ( 2006 :6–21) in his discussion of Plato’s cosmology. 21. O’Meara ( 1993:60–79) refers to it as “derivation,” arguing that this  term is “less speciﬁ  c” when applied to the explanation of the constitution of  intelligible beings by the One as opposed to terms like “emanation,” “creation,”  or “making.” Although I see, with O’Meara, the need for a less speciﬁ  c term to  express such a general idea, I think “unfolding” captures best Plotinus’ idea of the composition of the universe, as is discussed in chapter 5. Rist’s “efﬂ  uence”  (1962 a: 99–107) is another successful rendering.</p><div id="pagenum"><p>22.

The nondiscursiveness of the One itself obscures both the  primal separation from the One and Plotinus’ account of it. The aporia of explaining precisely how the interaction between a higher  and a lower metaphysical principle occurs does not originate with Plotinus but  can be traced back to the Timaeus  itself. In his discussion of the nature of the  Receptacle in Ti. 50b–c, Plato explains that, in it, the Forms mold their onto- logical patterns onto the primary elements “in an unexplainable and wondrous  fashion.”23 The nondiscursiveness of the cosmogonical act that originates phys- ical reality stems from the intelligible nature of the Forms and the dianoetic difﬁ culties surrounding the Receptacle itself. The Receptacle is not in a par- ticular point in time and space, but “its nature is to be available for anything  to make its impression upon, and it is modiﬁ  ed, shaped, and reshaped by the  things that enter in it.” 24 Plato views the systasis  of the disorderly matter of the  Receptacle to be beyond the human ability to conceive or to describe. Ancient and modern scholars alike have cast many nets to compre- hend the nature of Plato’s Receptacle. Aristotle associates matter with the Indeﬁ  nite Dyad and the Receptacle, the disorderly state of which is the  source of evil. This view, however, raises the problem, unthinkable for Plato  and Plotinus, that the Forms, which come from the Indeﬁ  nite Dyad, pos- sess evil. 25 Plotinus attempts to solve the problem by distinguishing two  types of matter: sensible and intelligible.26 I think Cornford’s point that “the  R e c e p t a c l e  i s  n o t  t h a t  ‘ o u t  o f  w h i c h ’  ( ex hou ) things are made; it is that  ‘in which’ ( en hôi ) qualities appear” best describes the difference between  the two types of matter.27 Plotinus’ concept of intelligible matter has caused  embarrassment among Neoplatonic scholars. The terms “intelligible” and “matter” crown the opposite ends of the ontological hierarchy and seem to be m u tuall y ex cl usi v e . Rist so l v es th e p rob lem b y su ggesting that “th e con-templation of the One by NoËw  [sic] in the form of Intelligible Matter is the  cause of the very existence of the Second Hypostasis.” 28 Similarly to the mysterious way in which the Forms imprint their  characteristics onto the Receptacle in the Timaeus,  Plotinus views the ori- gin of the universe as a thaumastic act.29 While Plato makes the Receptacle  23.Ti.50c6:trÒpon tinå dÊsfraston ka‹ yaumastÒn .

For the origin is not divided up into the All, for if it were divided up it would destroy the All too; and the All could not any more come into being if the origin did not remain by itself, different from it. (III. 8.10.14–19) 30 The passage describes one of Plotinus’ postulates about the ﬁ  rst hypostasis,  that is, the One is simple. Although our analytically trained minds cannot be satisﬁ  ed by the spiritual and maybe even religious connotations of Plotinus’  use of thauma,  a close examination reveals that the passage lists the reasons  for the ontogenetic wonder of the universe not by establishing what the One is but by negating what multiplicity is. 31 In doing so, he chooses the top-down  approach and looks at the glass as half full, that is, negating that which is, instead of establishing that which is not. Since the One cannot be reasoned (VI.8.14.30), does not have predication (V. 5.6.24, VI.8.8.6), and is truly ineffable  (V.3.13.1), 32 we haphazardly understand why Plotinus perceives the separation  as a thauma.  But if we contextualize Plotinus’ description of the origin of mul- tiplicity in Plato’s presentation of the cosmogonical act in the Receptacle “in an unexplainable and wondrous fashion” ( tropon tina dysphraston kai thaumaston, Ti.50c6), we can truly understand that Plotinus transposes the  cosmogonical  mystery from the Receptacle at the brink between the intelligible and physical  the ﬁ  rst but subordinate. It is only as a heuristic device that multiplicity can be  said to arise from the One.” From the modern epistemological point of view,  Gerson is right. The textual evidence, however, shows that Plotinus still views  the origin of multiplicity as thauma,  despite his logical explanation of it. 30. Cf. VI. 9.5.30:yaËma toË ßn, ˘ mØ ˆn §stin . 31.

Both Plato’s systasis  and Plotinus’ apostasis contain thauma. Plotinus’ Apostasis  and Numenius’ Stasis The relationship between the Timaeus  and Plotinus’ cosmology cannot be  understood without considering the intermediary of Neopythagoreanism.  The directional polarity with which Plato and Plotinus conceive the begin- ning of the universe is also a result of the conceptual innovation of Platonic thought in the Neopythagorean generation before Plotinus and speciﬁ  cally  by Numenius, who indirectly inﬂ  uenced him, most likely through Ammonias  Saccas, whose lectures Plotinus attended personally during his Alexandrian  period ( VP3). 33 I will discuss at greater length the complex relationship  between Plotinus and his teachers and contemporaries in the beginning of chapter 2, which is devoted to the Neopythagorean inﬂ  uence on his concepts  of multiplicity and number. Since our current subject is the Platonic context  of Plotinus’ cosmology, here I examine Numenius’ views only as an attempt to discover the missing link between the cosmologies of Plato and Plotinus. With the concepts of the One and multiplicity, Plotinus rewrites the  Timaeus  infused with post-Platonic and more speciﬁ  cally Neopythagorean  ideas. According to Numenius, Three Gods order the universe: the Father  (patêr ), the Maker ( poiêtês ), and the Creation ( poiêma ). 34 In this triad, schol- ars have rightly seen the precursor of Plotinus’ three hypostases, with the  notable exception that the ﬁ  rst hypostasis in Plotinus is beyond the other  two.35 The fragment below explains the relationship between the First  and the Second God from a point of view which, I think, is crucial for Plotinus’ understanding of apostasis.  “In the place of the motion, which is  characteristic to the Second [God], I say that the stability, which is char- acteristic of the First [God], is an innate motion, from which the order of the universe is and its eternal unity and preservation is poured toward all things” (fr. 15 ). 36 Numenius’ concept of the First God as both at rest and  in innate motion completes reasonably well, in my judgment, the concep-tual shift between Plato’s view of the universe as a composition ( tou kosmou  33.

The First God is not Plato’s Demiurge,37 but his  concept of the absolute Good, which Plotinus later reﬁ  nes, with the help of  Moderatus, as the One.38 The Second God is the Demiurge, later elicited in  Plotinus’ Intellect. If we consider what O’Meara calls Plotinus’ Principle of  Prior Simplicity,39 we can conclude that, in Numenius, since the First God  is transcendent, it possesses, in an absolute form, the qualities of the Second God. Consequently, since motion is the characteristic of the Second God, the First God must possess innate motion ( kinêsis symphytos ). Numenius  describes the First God to be in stasis , which is not static but dynamic and  p o s s e s s e s  a n  i n n a t e  m o t i o n  t h a t  o r d e r s  t h e  c o s m o s  ( taxis tou kosmou ). 40 So  how are we to understand the conceptual paradox of Numenius’ First God as innately moving stability? The inﬂ  uence of the Timaeus  on Numenius’ views is rather detectable.  Of most interest to us is that Numenius combines Plato’s idea that being is “always according to itself” ( Ti.28a8) with the primary kinds of Being, Rest,  and Motion ( Sophista 254d). 41 I n  o r d e r  t o  r e n d e r  t h e  c o s m o g o n i c a l  m o t i o n   in the Timaeus,  we may suppose that Numenius conﬂ  ates Plato’s primary  kinds of Being, Rest, and Motion in his First God and perceives of it as  stability ( stasis ) in innate motion ( kinêsis symphytos ). Although Numenius’  conceptual adaptation of the Timaeus  seems paradoxical, it is not out of line  with his Three Gods. On the contrary, this kind of paradox is ingrained in  his system. For example, the Second God “uniﬁ  es matter, but is split by it” (fr. 11 ), “creates both his own idea and the cosmos” (fr. 16), and “the  Second and the Third Gods are one” (fr. 11). Dodds ﬁ  nds the answer to  these paradoxes in Proclus’ interpretation of Numenius’ system in the con- text of Ti. 39e6–9. 42 According to Proclus, “Numenius equates the First God  with the living creature that truly is,43 and says that he thinks ( noei) by call- ing in the help of the Second God ( en proschrêsei tou deuterou ); he equates  his Second God with Nous,  and says that Nous creates by calling the help  37.

Thus there is an implicit interdependence  among the three gods. Dodds does not extend his interpretation to solve the paradox of sta- sis and kinêsis symphytos in the First God. But I see no reason why not. If  motion ( kinêsis ) is the characteristic of the Second God and if the First God,  as the highest grade of reality ( autoon ),47 is in stasis,  then the First God must  “borrow” the motion of the Second God and make it innate motion ( kinêsis  symphytos ). While “being” proper negates the idea of motion and the First  God is in stasis  proper,48 the First God must possess innate motion in order  to account for the motion of the Second God. Although this argument may  seem circular, the circularity is not generated by our analysis but stems from the interdependent elements of Numenius’ system itself. In VI. 6, Plotinus solves, I would argue, the difﬁ  culty of Numenius’  stasis-kinêsis  paradox by expressing only implicitly the idea of motion in the  term apostasis,  literally meaning “away from the stasis. ” That Plotinus is  aware of Numenius’ deﬁ  nition is clear in III. 9.7–9, which explicitly discusses  the characteristics of Numenius’ First and Second Gods. 49 While explaining  the relationship between Intellect and the Forms, based on the same pas-sage from Ti. 39e used by Proclus, 50 Plotinus postulates that “the One is  the power of motion and rest, so that is beyond them; but the Second is at rest and also in motion around the First. ” 51 Plotinus completely removes the  One from the ontological equation (perhaps a distant relative of Numenius’  44. Dodds’ translation ( 1957:13). 45. Although I ﬁ  nd Dodd’s explanation of the noêsis  of the First God shady,  his discussion of the dianoia  of the Second God is compellingly lucid. 46.

It implies that, according to him, the origin of the universe is not a  cosmogonical act as it is for Plato in the Timaeus,  but a cosmological act  that arranges the cosmos of the universe. Plotinus, it seems, shares the same view in VI. 6 and develops Numenius’ idea in two ways. First, by focusing  on the state of existence of multiplicity in VI. 6.1, he reinforces Numenius’  understanding that the coming-to-be of the universe is a cosmological rather  than cosmogonical act. 53 Second, he coins the term apostasis  to signify the  former.54 Thus, it is through Numenius that, as we said in the beginning of  the chapter, Plotinus’ cosmology begins where Plato’s cosmogony ends. Numenius’ concept of stasis  of the One is the foundation of Plotinus’  understanding of apostasis.  Explaining the transcendent nature of the One in  VI.5.3, Plotinus asserts axiomatically that the One does not separate from itself  (existatai );55 i t  d o e s  n o t  c o m e  i n t o  b e i n g ;  i t  i s  n o t  i n  a n y  p h y s i c a l  p l a c e ,  b u t   i s  al w a y s  wi th  i ts e lf ;  i t  d oes  n o t  s tan d  a w a y  fr o m  i ts e lf  ( mê diestanai ), so that  nothing comes from it ( m ê d e  p r o i e n a i  t i  a p ’  a u t o u ); and it does not separate  from anything ( mêdenos apostatein ). The language of this description empha- sizes that the One does not participate in the separation of multiplicity from  itself. Because the One is beyond being and nondianoetic, it can be conceived only as an opposite to that which originates from it. As a result, the One is described by negating the ontogenetic separation of multiplicity from the One. I f  w e  r e m o v e  t h e  p r e ﬁ  xes denoting separation from the verbs listed above  (ex-istatai, die-stanai, pro-ienai, apo-statein ), 56 w e  a r e  l e f t  p u r e l y  w i t h  t h e   52.

Plotinus repeatedly emphasizes that the extending of the universe from  the One does not occur in time but presents only dianoetically the structure of the universe. 54. The term does not occur in any metaphysical context before Plotinus  but is prevalent in the post-Plotinian Neoplatonists: Simplicius, In Cael.,  vol. 7, p. 255.9,In Ph.,  vol. 9, p. 798 .14,In de An.  vol. 11, p. 6 .7; Iamblichus, Comm.

If we ignore, for a moment, the nondiscursiveness of the One, we can  perceive that the apostasis  of multiplicity is a direct result of the stasis of the  One. We may even suppose dianoetically that the One is in stasis  because  the One is not divided, does not pour forth, remains in itself, is always  with itself, is one and the same in number, and exists as a whole. All these characteristics of the One negate the characteristics of multiplicity found in VI. 6.1. When we restore the nondiscursiveness and absoluteness of the  One at the end of this hypothetical exercise, we can understand that the One does not possess stasis  or kinêsis  but only emanates them: “[the One]  does not move nor does it stand still,” 57 and yet, something generated by  the One leaves it and comes into the other things in many ways.58 In this  vein, the immediate separation from the One is a result of the transcendent nature of the One. A much-discussed passage in V. 3.11 offers a good starting point for examin- ing the very ﬁ  rst separation. It explains that Intellect, as the Second Hypostasis,  turns itself toward the One in a contemplative act in which Intellect sees the One as multiplicity. When Intellect turns itself toward the One in a desire to attain to the One in its simplicity, it perceives something else, which is many in itself ( plêthynomenon,  V.3.11.3–4). Here Plotin us enigmatically explains that  Intellect does not act as Intellect in this process but as sight “which has not  yet seen” ( opsis oupô idousa,  V.3.11.5). W e get a better idea of what he is talking  about when he elaborates that Intellect perceives the multiplicity reﬂ  ected from  the One as an imagination ( phantasma ) and gains sight and knowledge of the  One only after understanding in a contemplative act that many come from the  One. 59 Itself thinking and the object of thought, Intellect comes into existence  57. V.5.10.16–17:oÈ går kine›tai oÈd' ßsthken . Plotinus reverses the  order of Plato’s quote oÈte ßsthken oÈte kine›tai  at Sph. 250c7,Prm. 139b3, and Lg.893c2. 58.

This interpretation of multiplicity follows the same  line of reasoning as V. 5.5.3, where Plotinus clariﬁ  es that “in the case of numbers, the  one remains unchanged, but another one makes number” ( poioËntow d¢ êllou ). 59. Rist ( 1962 a: 101) argues that the passage explains how the Indeﬁ  nite  Dyad experiences the ﬁ  rst act of separation. Even if this is what Plotinus has in  mind implicitly, I do not think we have enough hard evidence for it in the text. He is usually very speciﬁ  c when he talks about the éÒristow dËaw  and wants </p><div id="pagenum"><p>us to distinguish it from Intellect. But throughout this passage, he refers to the entity he is talking about only as noËw .</p></div><div id="pagenum"><p>PLOTINUS ON NUMBER 36</p></div><p id="page">simultaneously at the very moment when Intellect understands that the One  is many. In the coming-to-be of Intellect, the One reveals itself as multiplicity because Intellect sees itself as multiplicity. The emanation of Intellect as multiplicity from the One in Plotinus rep- resents both the stasis and the kinêsis symphytos in Numenius’ First God.  He further stratiﬁ  es Numenius’ concept by separating the stasis  of the First  God from the kinêsis symphytos  in which the One is absolute and beyond  being, while the Indeﬁ  nite Dyad, as will be discussed later, conceptualizes  the principles of innate motion, duality, and creation of the Second God. 60 Although, in Plotinus, the One does not participate in the act of manyness and remains in absolute stasis,  it reveals itself through the innate motion in  the Indeﬁ  nite Dyad. 61 Contemplating the One, Intellect sees the multiplicity  of the Indeﬁ  n i t e  D y a d  a s  a  r e ﬂ  ection of the One. Only then can Intellect,  ﬁ lled with the multiplicity that emanates from the One ( plêrôtheis ), stand  still ( stas) and contemplate the One.62 The opening chapter of VI. 6 offers an informative example of what  Gerson calls the “uncompromising radical character” of Plotinus’ thought.63 Since Plotinus gives an account of the structure of the universe through mul-tiplicity, he must vest the cosmogony in the Timaeus  in garments suited to the  post-Platonic taste of his time. His top-down approach sketches the ontologi-cal ladder of the universe in which the One and Inﬁ  nity are respectively at the  top and the bottom of its hierarchy, while multiplicity is their intermediary. 64 In cosmological terms, the apo-stasis from the One con-stitutes the existence  of the universe, pun intended. My main point is not that there is an intertextual echo of systasis/ stasis/ apostasis  respectively in Plato/Numenius/Plotinus, but that the different  points from which Plato, Numenius, and Plotinus develop their cosmogoni- cal accounts (bottom, middle, and top) build the same structure of the uni-verse, which, in its turn, demands the above intertextual echo. This echo highlights both the conceptual differences and the conceptual similarities among the three cosmologies. 60. See the discussion of substantial number and Intellect in chapter 5. 61. The multiplicity of the Indeﬁ  nite Dyad is not in conﬂ  ict with the  Absolute One (VI. 4.4). 62. V.5.8.9–13. 63. Gerson ( 1997:299); see also pp. 24–25. 64. His view of multiplicity in the beginning of VI. 6 casts a positive light  on the participation of multiplicity in the structure of the universe and stands  in direct opposition to the theme of the last treatise in the Großschrift —II. 9,On  the Evil, number 33  in the chronological order of the Enneads  and immediately </p><div id="pagenum"><p>preceding VI. 6.</p></div><div id="pagenum"><p>PLATONIC COSMOLOGY ON PLOTINIAN TERMS 37</p></div><p id="page">The Universe as Degrees of Separation from the One The term apostasis does not occur in philosophical texts before Plotinus. It  appears strictly in mathematical works to signify physical distance.65 The  term is used without any ontological connotations even by Theon of Smyrna  in his treatise The Mathematics Useful for the Understanding of Plato, where  it is only used to measure the radius of a circle.66 Considering Numenius’  meaning of stasis  as kinêsis symphytos and Plotinus’ via negativa  description  of the One, it is reasonable, I think, to conclude that Plotinus coined the  term to denote the cosmological process in which the universe exists as dif- ferent from and dependent upon the One.67 He separates the stasis  from the  kinêsis symphytos  in Numenius and delegates them respectively to the One  and Intellect. Although the One does not possess any particular qualities, it possesses them in absolute form. If the One is the absolute stasis  from which  the universe unfolds, the term apostasis  literally negates the meaning of sta- sis. The One is in stasis  in the sense that it is the absolute starting point of  the universe, while Intellect, through the emanation from the One, receives the stasis  and kinêsis in actuality. Since separation from the One leads to  existence, apostasis denotes ontological becoming and thus being. 68 Based on the deﬁ  nition of multiplicity in VI. 6.1, we may expect that  Plotinus would present the underlying principles of the universe as a degree o f  s e p a r a t i o n  f r o m  t h e  O n e .  I n  o t h e r  w o r d s ,  m u l t i p l i c i t y  ( plêthos ) would  measure the universe from the Being to the embodied soul. We do not need to search far in the Enneads  to ﬁ  nd out that, indeed, he employs the idea  of separation, although at some embryonic stage, as a measurement of the distance from the One to the second and to the third hypostases. Let us examine VI. 2.5 closely. Explaining that multiplicity comes from  a plurality that is one and yet different from the absolute One, Plotinus  65.

Aristotle uses apostasis  only once in the deﬁ  nition of time, which is not  in a cosmological or metaphysical context.

The later commentators pick up on Plotinus’ use of apostasis  to mean  existence. Discussing the actual activities ( energeiai ) of Intellect, Damascius  explains that the energeia  of Intellect is directed toward the One and not toward  separation from being, that is, nonexistence ( épÒstasiw épÚ toË e‰nai ,De </p><div id="pagenum"><p>Principiis  vol. 1, p. 133 .7).</p></div><div id="pagenum"><p>PLOTINUS ON NUMBER 38</p></div><p id="page">r e mar ks  tha t  “ th e  e x t e n t  o f  th e  s e p ara ti o n  fr o m  b e in g  i s  as  gr ea t  as  tha t  o f   the departure from unity.”69 Contextually, apostasis  here means measurement  of a degree of beingness and unity. As already determined in V. 3.11,70 the ﬁ  rst  separation from the One is a contemplative act in which Intellect sees the One in its multiplicity ( plêthynomenon ). This multiplicity is uniﬁ  ed because  it is an image of the absolute One. The absolute One cannot participate itself in this multiplicity because it is beyond being and does not become multi-plicity but reveals itself to Intellect as multiplicity, uniﬁ  e d  b y  o n e .  V I . 2.5 clariﬁ  es the explanation of the ﬁ  rst separation in V. 3.11 by highlighting the  differences between the absolute One and the one containing multiplicity.  The former is beyond being; the latter is uniﬁ  ed being. 71 The former is abso- lute unity; the latter is the uniﬁ  ed multiplicity, emanated by the former. The  latter represents the originative principle of the Indeﬁ  nite Dyad, which is  best reﬂ  ected in the double nature of Intellect, able to think itself and to  think all the beings in itself.72 But nowhere in the Enneads  does Plotinus speciﬁ  cally call the Indeﬁ  nite  Dyad or even Intellect apostasis.73 In the passages describing Intellect’s con- templation of the One in which Intellect becomes aware of its existence, the  idea of separation is represented by the differences between the Absolute One and Intellect. 74 I  s h o u l d  n o t e  t h a t  h e  p r e f e r s  t o  c h a r a c t e r i z e  I n t e l l e c t   by its closeness to rather than remoteness from the One. The reason, I sug- gest, for his interest in emphasizing the distance from the One at the end  rather than at the top of the ontological spectrum lies in Plotinus’ view that Intellect is closer to the One and thus it is obvious that is related to the One, whereas it is more difﬁ  cult to grasp the relation of the innumerable physical  reality to the One. Although Soul is most ontologically distant from the One, it is still related to it: But since Soul depends on Intellect and Intellect on the Good, so all things depend on him through intermediaries, some close  69.

(VI.7.42.21–24) 75 I quote this passage not only to demonstrate the ontological succession of the underlying principles in the structure of the universe but also to prove that Plotinus perceives the ontological succession in terms of separation. His view of physical reality as ontologically the farthest separation from the One measures the dependence of sense-perceptible reality upon the under-lying principle of Soul conceived as “the furthest separation” ( pleistê apos- tasis,  V.1.1.7–8). 76 All references to apostasis  as ontological distance pertain  to Soul and physical reality or, put differently, to the end of the ontological spectrum. 77 A t  t h e  b o t t o m  o f  t h i s  c h a i n  o f  s e p a r a t i o n  s t a n d s  i n ﬁ  nity as a  complete separation from the One ( pantelês apostasis,  VI.6.1.2). In I.8.7,78 Plotinus further deﬁ  nes the meaning of apostasis  in VI. 6 by  recognizing the different ontological motions in the separation: the mov- ing away ( ekbasis ),79 which results in the Otherness from the One, and the  moving down ( hypobasis ), which traces the ontological hierarchy from the  intelligible to the sensible world. The two terms clarify that apostasis  in  VI.6 means falling away,80 separating, expanding, and going down from the  One, which produces the universe as extended multiplicity ( diestêkos plêthos, VI.2.5.9) .  T h e  m o v i n g  a w a y  a n d  m o v i n g  d o w n  r e p r e s e n t  t h e  i n n a t e  m o t i o n   of multiplicity as ontologically dependent on the One, while apostasis  denotes  the state in which multiplicity abides as Otherness from the One. The separation from the One is an ontologically deteriorating act in  which “a thing is multiple when, unable to tend to itself, it pours out and  is extended in scattering; and when it is utterly deprived of the one in its  75.

In fact, multiplicity is the universe. But, breaking the Pythagorean tradition that views multiplicity as complete evil, 81 Plotinus ameliorates multiplicity’s lack of absolute ontological unity  by explaining that the universe does not expand searching for anything else but itself (VI. 6.1.10–14). 82 As a result, this desire turns multiplicity inward,83 connects it, albeit faintly,84 with the One, and thus preserves it from “com- plete separation from the One” ( pantelês apostasis, VI.6.1.2), meaning inﬁ  nity  and nonexistence. This inward desire induces order and correspondence in m ul ti p li ci ty  “ b e ca u s e  w h a t  n ee d e d  o r d e r e d  b ea u ty  w as  m an y ” 85 and creates  kosmos.  From the intelligible beings to their material images, order arranges  multiplicity into a one-in-many universe. The discussion of the ontological distance of apostasis draws together  the concepts of the One and multiplicity as a Plotinian pair of opposites ( hen  plêthos ).  I  c h ara ct e riz e  thi s  p air  o f  o p p o s i t es  as  P l o tini an  n o t  t o  d i s tin gui s h   it from the Pythagorean and Platonic pair of One and Many but to highlight Plotinus’ understanding of Multiplicity as a collective plêthos  in VI. 6, and not  as the individualized plurality conveyed by the standard ta polla.  Plotinus  introduces the concept of multiplicity as a measurement of ontological dis-tance from the One, creating the orderly structure of the universe. Let us recapitulate our ﬁ  ndings. Plotinus deﬁ  nes the beginning of the  universe as a separation ( apostasis ) from the One that results in the ontolog- ically hierarchical existence of everything. The ﬁ  rst hypostasis is both abso- lute stability and absolute motion and therefore the absolute starting point of the separation that results in the existence of the universe. Possessing ontological stability inherent in being, Intellect is a separation that is closest to the One because ﬁ  rst Intellect perceives itself as the multiplicity of the  Indeﬁ  nite Dyad and only then realizes that this multiplicity comes from the  One. Finally, Soul, as the ontologically weakest form of existence, oscillating between the intelligible and the material world, represents the farthest sep-aration from the One. 86 81. This is the main point of Losev’s commentary on VI. 6.1 (1928 :12–14). 82. For the outward and inward stages of separation, see Charles-Saget  (1980 :32). 83.

Among the Enneads,  VI.6 is the best  candidate for this work as it follows the long Neopythagorean tradition of philosophizing about numbers. 1 The heading above reﬂ  ects the strong and  yet subtle Neopythagorean movement in the ﬁ  rst and second centuries, wit- tily called the “Neopythagorean underground,”2 and the tangible presence of  Neopythagorean elements in Plotinus’ concept of multiplicity. In VP 14, Porphyry reports the names of Severus, Cronius, Numenius,  Gaius, and Atticus among the philosophers whose works Plotinus used in his lectures. Among them, Numenius is distinguished in that Plotinus was accused of appropriating his ideas and later absolved from the charges in a letter written by Longinus ( VP17–21) .  T h e  l e t t e r  a l s o  a t t e s t s ,  a s  r e p o r t e d   by Porphyry, that Plotinus “deliberately propounded Pythagorean views, and the works of Numenius and Cronius and Moderatus and Thrasyllus come nowhere near the accuracy of Plotinus’s treatises on the same subjects” (VP 21.5–9) .  E v e n  i f  w e  i g n o r e  t h e  e n c o m i a s t i c  t o n e  o f  P o r p h y r y ’ s  b i o g r a - phy , it is clear that Plotinus was highly esteemed in Neopythagorean circles, and his use of Neopythagorean material should surface, in its turn, from the scholarly underground for serious consideration. In VP3, Porphyry also documents that Plotinus was a student of  Ammonius Saccas, a mysterious ﬁ  gure who swore his students to secrecy  about his doctrines. Most likely his secrecy is not the sole reason for our lack  of written evidence from him. But since both Numenius and Ammonius are thought to have introduced Plotinus to Neopythagoreanism, 3 the paucity of  Numenius’ extant fragments and the lack of Ammonius’ writings present a  serious obstacle for directly studying the Neopythagorean roots of Plotinus’ understanding of multiplicity and number. We can, however, perform a kind of conceptual archaeology to search and uncover the Neopythagorean remains scattered throughout the Enneads.  Although scholars have generally  1.

In the previous chapter, we exam-ined the inﬂ  uence of Numenius’ concept of the First God as stability ( sta- sis) and innate motion on Plotinus’ idea that the universe is a separation  (apostasis ) from the One. In its turn, Numenius’ idea of stasis contains ele- ments that characterize the deﬁ  nition of number found in the fragments of  his not-so-distant contemporary Moderatus. 5 According to him, number is a  system of monads ( systêma monadôn ), which is a progression of multiplicity  (propodismos plêthous ) beginning from the monad and a regression ( anapodis- mos plêthous ) stopping at the monad.6 This reasoning makes the ﬁ  rst monad  both the beginning of the ascending sequence of numbers and the end of the descending sequence of numbers. The monad is the actual limit of quantity because there is no number smaller than it. When multiplicity is decreased by subtraction of all numbers, the naked monad ( sterêtheisa ), Moderatus con- cludes, receives onlyness ( monê ) and stability ( stasis ). Since the monad is  both the starting point and the ﬁ  nishing end for numbers, the monad lacks  motion and thus represents stability. If all numbers start with and return to the monad, the monad must be unmoved, ﬁ  xed, and stable. This stability  makes the monad the limit of quantity. 7 Reworking Platonic ideas and Neopythagorean mathematics,8 Moderatus  further distinguishes between the monad and the number one. The monad is  4. Dodds ( 1928 ); Rist ( 1962 b); Jackson ( 1967); Whittaker ( 1969 ); Dillon  (1996 :347). See also pp. 45–46. 5. See p. 8. 6.

But while Iamblichus, probably following  Nicomachus ( Ar.1,7,1.2), calls it monadôn systêma,  Theon of Smyrna, perhaps  following Moderatus, calls it systêma monadôn.  This reversal is most likely  incidental, but it may also indicate two different traditions. 7. Theon, Expos. rer. math. , p. 18 ,5.

This generating principle is different from the  numerical expression of individual things. If we view the monad as a princi-ple of numbers ( tôn arithmôn archê ), for example, the number ﬁ  ve represents  ﬁ ve monads that are brought together to form one unity, like our ﬁ  ve-digit  hand. When we think of a normal hand, we do not think of the ﬁ  ve ﬁ ngers  individually but of the ﬁ  ve ﬁ ngers that all together make one hand. But, from  the point of the one as the principle of enumerated things ( tôn arithmêtôn  archê ), the number ﬁ  ve enumerates ﬁ  ve individual things, like ﬁ  ve chocolate  bonbons. 10 The difference between the intelligible principle of number and  the mathematical principle of number in Moderatus anticipates Plotinus’ dis- tinction between intelligible and arithmetical number. This distinction brings us to the question of the ﬁ  rst One in Moderatus.  It is not clear from the extant fragments exactly how Moderatus explains  the difference between the monad as the ﬁ  rst principle of number and the One as the ﬁ  rst underlying principle of existence. A controversial passage in  Simplicius ( In Phys.  A 7 ,230.34), which I interpret, with Dodds, Jackson,  and Rist, as representing Moderatus’ views, 11 lists three separate Ones as  underlying principles of existence: the ﬁ  rst One, which is “above Being and  all essence”; the second One, which is “truly existent and an object of intel- lection”; and the third One, which is “the soul-realm which participates in the previous two.” 12 Unfortunately, it is unclear who the author of the  doctrine is. The text states that, according to Moderatus’ report, ﬁ  rst the  P y t h a g o r e a n s ,  f o l l o w e d  b y  P l a t o ,  f o r m  a n  o p i n i o n  a b o u t  m a t t e r  ( hylê).13 In  9. Stobaeus , Anth.,  vol. 1, p. 21 . It is not absolutely clear from the text  that Moderatus shares this opinion, but it is quite reasonable to assume so.  Otherwise, the text would have somehow indicated a divergence. 10. It is unlikely that this distinction leads Moderatus to the conclusion  that number is quantity in the intelligible realm ( to en noêtois poson ), as  reported by Theon ( Expos. rer. math. , p. 19 ,15) and as later rejected by Plotinus  (VI.6.4). The phrase is in a sentence that connects almost verbatim Moderatus’  two fragments quoted in Stobaeus. Contrary to Dodds ( 1928 :138, n. 2 ), who  attributes the phrase to Moderatus, I think it is safer to suspect, for the lack of  textual evidence, Theon’s addition. 11.

Relating Moderatus’ account, Simplicius makes a syllogistic  jump from the names of the Pythagoreans and Plato to Moderatus’ views. In his mind, all three of them represent the same doctrines, and he lists them accordingly. The idea of the three Ones is certainly Middle Platonic and most likely Neopythagorean, and the author, even if not Moderatus, is Neopythagorean. 15 But even if Moderatus did not come up with the system  of the three Ones, which is unlikely as I will discuss presently, this text  proves that he at least knew of this view, and we should expect him to incor-porate it in his own ideas. The Neopythagorean origin of the concept of the One has been at the  center of a long and heated scholarly debate. Dodds, followed by Jackson,  discovers an earlier Neopythagorean doctrine within Moderatus’ three Ones in the Parmenides,  while Rist purports that the doctrine is original to  Moderatus. 16 I think Moderatus’ deﬁ  nition of number can bring us closer to  answering this question: He postulates that both number and the numbered things have 1.  founding principles, respectively as the ﬁ  rst principle of numbers ( tôn  arithmôn archê ) and as a principle of enumerated things ( tôn arithmêtôn  archê ). He distinguishes between numbers representing unities and numbers 2.  enumerating individual things, such as the difference between the  monad and the number one.

Rist has argued that Alexander’s testimony demonstrates that the monad has two functions: the ﬁ rst, which treats the monad as the Supreme Principle, is a prototype of the  Neoplatonic One, and the second, which treats the monad as a productive principle, is a precursor of the Neoplatonic Intellect. Polyhistor’s text, how-ever, does not separately account for the third One, which relates to physical  reality but combines it with the Second One by stating that the Indeﬁ  nite  Dyad is at the foundation of the material principle. If we take into account  Moderatus’ distinction between unifying number and enumerating number, I think we can modify Rist’s classiﬁ  cation of the dual function of the monad  to account for Moderatus’ three Ones. 19 The ﬁ  rst One, as a supreme prin- ciple of everything, derives from Moderatus’ view that the Monad is archê  in the sense of absolute stability and an absolute starting point. The sec-ond One, as a principle of creation, derives from the monad representing all numbers as absolute unities. The third One, as a principle of the material reality, derives from the number one as enumerating individual things. This reclassiﬁ  cation elucidates the inﬂ  uence of Moderatus’ deﬁ  nition of number  on his cosmological views. Such conceptual symbiosis between mathematics and the universe is a genuine Neopythagorean characteristic.

Like Plato’s cosmology in the Timaeus,  Moderatus’ deﬁ  nition of number  has motion at its foundation: all of number unfolds and enfolds to the monad  as a starting and an ending point. Moderatus’ bidirectional motion of number is woven into Plotinus’ understanding of the two directions of multiplicity. 25 In the beginning of VI. 6.1, Plotinus explains that multiplicity extends in  two opposite directions: ﬁ  r s t ,  a s  a n  o u t w a r d  m o t i o n  ( exô poreia ) from the  One (VI. 6.1.4–8);26 a n d  s e c o n d ,  a s  a n  i n w a r d  m o t i o n  ( pros hauto neneukos ) from the exterior toward the One (VI. 6.1.11–14).27 While the former explains  how multiplicity derives from the One, the latter illustrates how multiplicity retains its connection with the One. This bidirectional composition estab- lishes, ﬁ  rst, that the outward motion brings multiplicity to exist as “many and  large” in “a journey foolish and compulsory,” which induces an ontological weakening; 28 and second, that the inward motion directs multiplicity toward  22. This may be a good example of the clarity for which Longinus allegedly  praised Plotinus, as Porphyry reports in VP21. 23. The two terms are not attested in the extant mathematical texts. 24. See the end of the chapter. 25. Charles-Saget does not note this parallel. She ( 1980 :32) deﬁ  nes the  bidirectional procession of Multiplicity as dispersion ( de l’un au multiple, il y a  dispersion, écart progressif à l’égard de soi-même et du principe, donc mouvement  vers l’inﬁ  nité, l’inconsistance, le mal ) and concentration ( du multiple vers l’un,  dans le recueillement et l’inclination vers soi, se produit au contraire le resserrement  de l’être, le progrès vers l’existence et la possession de soi ). 26.

Like Moderatus’ progression of number, multiplicity ﬂ  ows from the  One through the ontogenic interaction between the Monad and the Indeﬁ  nite  Dyad, and ends with everything that exists. As a result of this action, mul-tiplicity comes to be and abides in its expanded state. The inward direc-tion, like Moderatus’ regression of number, turns itself toward its starting point and loses its quantity and size. The inward turning of multiplicity provides an ontological damage control of the outward direction. Although plêthos is unable to tend to itself originally and, pouring out of itself, scatters  to become multiplicity, it retains its desire to tend to itself and thus seeks itself inward. 31 I f  w e  c o n s i d e r  t h e  i n w a r d  m o t i o n  o f  m u l t i p l i c i t y  w i t h i n  t h e    context of Intellect’s perception of the One as many ( plêthynomenon ), the  29.

Corresponding to Moderatus’ deﬁ  nition of the monad as the absolute  limit of number, Plotinus characterizes the Monad in the Indeﬁ  nite Dyad  as the limit of multiplicity. Similarly, since Moderatus perceives no number outside of the monad, Plotinus ﬁ  nds nothing outside of the ﬁ  nite universe. 33 Just as, according to Moderatus, all numbers progress from and regress  to the monad, multiplicity, according to Plotinus, dynamically constructs the universe by unfolding from and enfolding to the One. Plotinus conceptual-izes the two directions of multiplicity in terms of the properties of number to increase and to decrease. Multiplicity as Efﬂ  uence and Unity So far we have discovered traces of both Moderatus and Numenius in Plotinus’ concept of multiplicity, and the omission of Nicomachus, from whom we actu-a l l y  h a v e  a  c o m p l e t e  e x t a n t  w o r k ,  i s  b e c o m i n g  r a t h e r  c o n s p i c u o u s . 34 Now is  the time to address this. In different treatises of the Enneads,  Plotinus refers  rather explicitly to Nicomachus’ threefold deﬁ  nition of number.35The view  that multiplicity is limited in VI. 6.1 points to Nicomachus’ understanding of  number as “limited multiplicity” ( plêthos hôrismenon ). The reference to math- ematical n um ber as m ul ti p lici ty o f henads ( plêthos henadôn ) in VI. 6.5.6 points  to Nicomachus’ deﬁ  n i t i o n  o f  n u m b e r  a s  “ a  c o m b i n a t i o n  o f  u n i t s ”  ( monadôn  systêma ). But, above all, Nicomachus’ deﬁ  nition of number as “a ﬂ  ow of quan- tity made up of units” ( posotêtos chyma ek monadôn sygkeimenon ) is most likely  behind one of the most vivid images of the transcendent nature of the One in the Enneads : If one enquires, therefore, where the living beings come from, one is enquiring where the sky there comes from; and this is to enquire  32. There is a tempting parallel between the self-tending ability of the One  (prÚw aÍtÚ neneukÒw , VI.6.1.13–14) and Porphyry’s description of Plotinus’  “self-turned attention” ( tÆn ge prÚw •autÚn prosoxÆn ,VP8.20). 33.

They all ﬂ  ow, in a way, from a single spring ( hê hoion rhoê  ek mias pêgês ), not like one particular breath or one warmth, but as  if there was one quality which held and kept intact all the qualities  in itself. . . . (VI. 7.12.19–26) 36 In light of Nicomachus’ deﬁ  ni ti o n  o f  n um b e r  as  “ a  ﬂ  ow” ( chyma ), the pas- sage does not simply offer a literary metaphor of the efﬂ  uence of the One  but presents a literal explanation of the ontological productive power of the One. 37 The transcendent nature of the One itself elicits the metaphor of ﬂ  ow- ing. Since, for Plotinus, multiplicity is number, the “ﬂ  owing” of the One  must also be number. Since the One’s productive power is omnipresent and multiplicity is the numbered expression of the One, the universe, while being regulated by number, ﬂ  ows out of the One. 38 Such ﬂ  ow, in turn, deﬁ  nes exis- tence and “the spring” ( rhoê) in the text is not a metaphor, but a conceptual  synonym for number. I will return to the relationship between the One and  number, but here I should note that the dependence of the universe on both the One and number juxtaposes the two concepts and raises the question of whether the One itself is number. 39 The efﬂ  uence of the One according to number best illustrates the unity  of Plotinus’ universe. Dependent on the One, the universe as multiplicity extends outward and contracts inward, akin to the behavior of number in the  deﬁ nitions of Moderatus and Nicomachus. 40 Plotinus summarizes: Now [multiplicity there is not Evil] because the multiplicity is uni-ﬁ ed ( hênôtai to plêthos ) and not allowed to be altogether multiplicity,  36. The treatise immediately succeeds VI. 6 in Porphyry’ s arrangement.  Armstrong ( 1988 : vol. 7 ,126–127) points out the connection of this passage with  Aristotle’s De Anima 405b26–29, which distinguishes the etymologies of the  Presocratic ideas of “to live” ( z∞n) and “to boil” ( ze›n). 37. On metaphor as Platonic “ontological concept, ” see Gerson ( 1997: 298–299). 38. Other vivid ﬂ  ow metaphors in Plotinus include the procession of the  unlimited (II. 4.11.31), the fountain-like multiplicity (IV. 7.4.32), the sun’s energy  (IV.5.7.5), and Soul’ s presence (VI. 7.11.59). 39. See the discussion of substantial number and the One in chapter 5. 40. Charles-Saget  (1980 :37) recognizes the remedial force of Plotinus’  argument here: Au préalable ( 3,2, à 9 ), une correction s’impose: la multiplicité </p><div id="pagenum"><p>n’est un mal comme le premier chapitre voulait le suggérer.</p></div><div id="pagenum"><p>MULTIPLICITY AS NUMBER 51</p></div><p id="page">being a one-multiple ( hen on plêthos ). And because of this it is less  than the One, because it has multiplicity ( hoti plêthos echei ), and in  so far as it is compared with the One, it is worse; and since it does  not have the nature of that One, but has gone out from it, it has been diminished, but it keeps its majesty by the one in it, and it turned back its multiplicity to one and there it stayed. (VI. 6.3.4–9) The above passage concerns multiplicity in the intelligible. The unity of multiplicity, albeit inferior to the unity of the One, carries with it the notion of the absolute unity of the One. Having gone out of the One ( ekbebêkos ), 41 the unity of multiplicity is inferior ( elattoutai,  VI.6.3.6) to the absolute unity  of the One and always remains a degree away from the perfect unity of its source. 42 But, as far as tending to itself and its source, the One, multiplicity  gains its ontological value. Through inward contemplation, unity brings the multiplicity of all beings closer to the One and farther away from physi-cal reality. 43 The centripetal orientation of every level of the architecture of  Plotinus’ universe serves a cosmological purpose. It is the counterpoint to the cosmogonical nature of the outward direction of multiplicity’s separation from the One and gathers the multiplicity of all intelligible beings and their sensible representations in a bondlike unity. 44 The preeminence of the concept of unity in the organization of the uni- verse also clariﬁ  es the distinction Plotinus makes between multiplicity ( to plê- thos) and many ( ta polla ) that I introduced at the end of chapter 1 .45 The former  refers collectively to every thing as a whole. The latter refers to multiplicity as  consisting of individual things. For example, Plotinus uses the terms monad,  triad , an d m yriad t o d e n o t e so m e thin g tha t e xis ts as o n e uni ty , w hil e , w h e n he ref ers to n um bers as com posi te from indi vi d ual things, he uses the n um-bers one, three, and ten thousand. 46 If we relate this distinction to the cosmo- logical stand poin t of m ul ti p lici ty as a separation from the One, then w e ﬁ  nd  another reason to talk not about the traditional pair of One ( hen) and Many  (polla ),47 as Plato does, but rather about the One ( to hen ) and Multiplicity  (plêthos ), as Plotinus does. The predominant use of plêthos  throughout VI. 6 suggests that the focus of the treatise is upon the unity of multiplicity relating to Moderatus’ monad as the ﬁ  rst principle of numbers ( tôn arithmôn archê ),  41.

Now is the time to address the question of why I think Moderatus and  not Nicomachus is the primary source of inﬂ  uence on Plotinus’ formulation  of the concepts of multiplicity and number, even though Moderatus’ thought i s  d o c u m e n t e d  o n l y  i n  s c r a p s  o f  f r a g m e n t s ,  a n d  N i c o m a c h u s ’  w o r k  i s  b e t -ter represented in its extant form. It is interesting that Porphyry mentions Moderatus twice among the philosophers whom Plotinus used extensively in his lectures, 48 while he explicitly omits Nicomachus. That Porphyry is  familiar with Nicomachus’ work is obvious from the references to his teach-ings in the Life of Pythagoras . 49Why does he leave out Nicomachus in the  Life of Plotinus ? I do not think the question can be answered with the cur- rent evidence. Nicomachus’ famous deﬁ  nition of number as a ﬂ  ow of number  composed of monads50 is undoubtedly at the foundation of Plotinus’ favorite  imagery of the efﬂ  uence of the One.51 But Nicomachus does not address, at  least in his extant works, two very important elements that are present in Moderatus and Plotinus: ﬁ  rst, the understanding of number as a motion from  and to the monad; and second, the conceptual difference between the monad (monas ) and the One ( hen) and between numbers ( arithmoi ) and numerable  things ( arithmêta ). Nicomachus, although distinguishing between paradig- matic numbers that preexist in the divine realm and arithmetical numbers, 52 does not offer an extensive cosmological account explaining the difference between intelligible and scientiﬁ  c number. 53 The latter is the sole object  of his Introduction to Arithmetic,  while the former is brieﬂ  y referenced in   chapter I. 6 and expanded in his section in the Theology of Arithmetic.54 Above  all, Nicomachus does not even talk about the above as two separate kinds of number, nor does he elaborate on their relationship. On the other hand, as d em o nstra t ed in th e p re vi o us secti o n, w e ﬁ  nd the answers to all these ques- tions in what little text is attributed to Moderatus. Thus I rest my case. The deﬁ  n i t i o n  o f  m u l t i p l i c i t y  a s  apostasis in VI. 6 infuses the motion,  inherent in the cosmogony in the Timaeus,  with Neopythagorean content.  48.VP20.75 and 21 .7. 49.VPyth. 20.3 and 59 .1. 50.Ar.

As a result, Plotinus’ cosmology is based specif- ically on the Neopythagorean deﬁ  nitions of number. Just as the monad is the  limiting principle of quality in Moderatus, Plotinus’ concept of multiplicity denotes multiplicity limited by numbers. For Plotinus, multiplicity is ﬁ  nite,  not inﬁ  nite, and number belongs to the intelligible realm, not to the theo-retical world of mathematics. This conceptual parallel suggests that number  may have a more signiﬁ  cant role in the organization of the intelligible realm  than scholars have recognized and that Plotinus brings the “Neopythagorean </p><div id="pagenum"><p>underground” to the Platonic foreground.</p></div><div id="pagenum"><p>543</p></div><p id="page">The Number of Inﬁ  nity In the study of Plotinus’ concept of number, Aristotle should come when  Plotinus himself introduces him. Otherwise, the long history of the debate between Aristotle and Plato’s successors on the concept of number may over-shadow Plotinus’ position on the issue. 1 If we want to investigate the latter,  we need to see the debate through Plotinus’ eyes. The difﬁ  culty with Plato’s concept of number begins with his “unwrit- ten doctrines,” in which he talked about the Good, Limit, and Unlimited as primary principles and allegedly equated numbers with the Forms. 2 The  latter conceptually deﬁ  nes the ontological role of numbers by implying that  numbers have a metaphysical property, different from their enumerating or  arithmetical property. Aristotle, following his scientiﬁ  c method of examina- tion, attempts to understand Plato’s ontological view of numbers by investi- gating their arithmetical nature because it is more objective. First Aristotle probes Plato’s understanding of inﬁ  nite number in Prm. 142b–145a, which  contains the Second Hypothesis that the one partaking in being is both lim-ited and unlimited. While this passage has attracted much scrutiny, Plotinus’ treatment of it in VI. 6.2–3 has received minimal scholarly attention for three  main reasons. The topic of the number of inﬁ  nity is seemingly outside of  the principal relationship among the three hypostases; it is in a treatise that, too, is outside of the main Neoplatonic interest; and not least, within VI.6, the topic itself has an outside position, hidden between the discussions  of multiplicity in VI. 6.1 and the primary subject of the treatise—the role of  number in the intelligible, in VI. 6.4–14. In addition, Plotinus’ treatment of  the number of inﬁ  nity, as he calls it, is usually considered extraneous to the  deﬁ nition of number proper. Charles-Saget identiﬁ  es the main purpose of  VI.6.2–3 to be the discussion of number and inﬁ  nity from both a quantita- tive and an ontological perspective, with emphasis on the latter. 3 A detailed  examination, however, suggests that the primary focus of the chapters is  the origin of number from the Indeﬁ  nite Dyad. Since the ﬁ  rst chapter of  VI.6 deals with the general explanation of the origin and characteristics of  1. See pp. 3–8. 2.

It seems that Plotinus wishes to do more than simply set out Plato’s  views. His concept of the three hypostases needs clariﬁ  cation, ﬁ  rst from a  cosmogonical and then from an ontological viewpoint, about how exactly number is generated and precisely what it does in the intelligible. While Rist has made much sense of the role of the Indeﬁ  nite Dyad in the intelligi- ble and Nikulin has dealt with the ontological aspect of the concept of num-ber, Plotinus’ contribution to Aristotle’s debate on Platonic number remains unexamined. 4 In this chapter, I argue that Plotinus introduces the subject of  the number of inﬁ  nity after the discussion of multiplicity in VI. 6 not only to  illustrate Aristotle’s misconception of Platonic numbers but also to explain the relationship between multiplicity as number and the Indeﬁ  nite Dyad as  the principle from which numbers originate. The notion that multiplicity is number, established in VI. 6.1, propels Plotinus to expand on his understand- ing of the Ideal Numbers before his explanation of the role of number in the intelligible realm in the central chapters of the treatise (VI. 6.4–14). The question about the number of inﬁ  nity is raised in the beginning of  the second chapter of VI. 6. 5 At ﬁ  rst glance, the question seems sudden and  without an apparent relation to the discussion of the separation of multiplic- ity from the One in chapter 1.  A t  s e c o n d  g l a n c e ,  h o w e v e r ,  i f  w e  c o n s i d e r   the ﬁ  nding of chapter 2 that multiplicity is number, the context of the ques- tion emerges. Because Plotinus understands multiplicity as a collective term  denoting the cosmological role of number in the universe, it is logical for him next to ask if multiplicity, that is, number proper, is ﬁ  nite or inﬁ  nite. Initially  he formulates the question as “what, then, about what is called the number of the inﬁ  nite” (VI. 6.2.1) ,  w h i c h  h e  i m m e d i a t e l y  r e p h r a s e s  i n t o  “ h o w  i t  i s   a number, if it is inﬁ  nite” (VI. 6.2.2) .

Plotinus’ discussion of the problem of the number of inﬁ  nity marks his  entry into the greater debate Aristotle wages against the Platonic doctrine  4. Rist ( 1962 a, 1962 b); Nikulin ( 1998 a, 2002 ). Ross ( 1951:185) does not put  Plotinus, Iamblichus, or Proclus on his list of later philosophers who have dealt  with the Indeﬁ  nite Dyad. Maybe his goal is to trace the concept in Aristotle’s  commentators from Theophrastus to Asclepius. 5.

Plotinus uses the concept of the number of  inﬁ nity to begin his defense of Plato and the Platonists because it allows him  to explain the relationship between number and the Indeﬁ  nite Dyad and the  role of number in the intelligible realm. This discussion further enables him to move, in VI. 6, from the subject of multiplicity in general to the examina- ti o n  o f  th e  r o l e  o f  n um b e r  p r o p e r  in  th e  in t e lli gi b l e .  T h e  d e ﬁ  nition of sep- aration of multiplicity from the One in VI. 6.1 sketches the big cosmological  picture. Next he needs to provide the details of how multiplicity, as number, unfolds into the universe. Since for Plotinus, as for all Platonists, numbers originate from the Indeﬁ  nite Dyad, he must ﬁ  rst address Aristotle’s miscon- ception of Plato’s reference to the Indeﬁ  nite Dyad and inﬁ  nite number. Plato’s Position Surprisingly for his Platonic attitude, Plotinus does not begin the analysis of Aristotle’s position with a discussion of Plato’s original text on the Second Hypothesis ( Prm. 142b–145a), which introduces the terms of inﬁ  nite mul- tiplicity ( apeiron plêthos ) and inﬁ  nite number ( apeiros arithmos ), but with  Aristotle’s interpretation of Plato’s ontological as well as mathematical expla-nation of the generation of numbers ( Metaph. 1083b). Plotinus goes directly to  the crux of the problem that Aristotle does not distinguish between the onto-logical and mathematical side of number. Aristotle’s disagreement with Plato, however, goes further back to the beginning of Metaphysics (987b29–34), where he criticizes Plato because, unlike the Pythagoreans, Plato considers  unity ( to hen ) and numbers to be different from the material things, introduces  the Forms, postulates a dyad to be “a nature different from unity,” and makes  this dyad generate all numbers “excluding the primes.” 7 This line of criticism  reveals that Aristotle dismisses the ontological interpretation of Plato’s argu-ment, although Plato’s line of reasoning is completely based on it. For example, in Prm. 142d9–143a, Plato proves that, in order for one to exist, it must contain two parts (existence and oneness). In turn, each of these two parts contains two others (existence and oneness), and so on and so forth. From this, it follows that, as Sayre notes, “the one in H 2 [the Second  Hypothesis] might be indeﬁ  nitely multitudinous . . . and to hen, because of its  unstable constituency (its parts always ‘becoming two’), is capable  of yielding  7. Earlier in Metaph. 986a16–17, Aristotle explains that, according to  Plato, number is an underlying principle of existence ( archên einai ) and acts  like a matter for beings ( hôs hylên tois ousi ). Perhaps in direct opposition to this  passage, Plotinus concludes in V. 1.5.9 that number is “as substance” ( hôs ousia ),</p><div id="pagenum"><p>discussed pp. 68–70.</p></div><div id="pagenum"><p>THE NUMBER OF INFINITY 57</p></div><p id="page">an apeiron plêthos,  n o t  t h a t  i t  w i l l  d o  s o  w i l l y - n i l l y . ”8 Sayre rightly argues  against Cornford’s analysis of the pa ssage as a deduction of “the existence  of the unlimited series of numbers”9 by pointing out that Plato’s text never  suggests that the inﬁ  nite multiplicity ( apeiron plêthos ) should be arranged in  inﬁ nite series. Instead, we should interpret the inﬁ  n i t e  m u l t i p l i c i t y  o n l y  a s   indeﬁ  nitely multitudinous and thus different from the inﬁ  nite number ( apeiros  arithmos ) in Prm. 144a6. Parmenides makes the transition from indeﬁ  nite  multiplicity to inﬁ  nite number by ﬁ  xing the initial indeﬁ  nite multiplicity into  “a set of distinct entities—two, three, twice two etc.”10 If there is the pair  of one-being, then there is a number. If there is a number, then there is an  inﬁ nite number ( 1+1=2;2+1=3; etc.),11 meaning that a set of numbers  is inﬁ  nitely numerous ( apeiros arithmos ). Therefore, Plato summarizes, “one,  itself cut up by being, is many, indeed, unlimited in multitude. . . . Thus, not only is being one many, but also one itself, divided up by being, is necessarily many” ( Prm. 144e3–9). The summary concludes the deduction that one and  being are equinumerous in the sense that each part of being is one part (one-ness) and each oneness is such a part (existence). By saying that number and being are inﬁ  nitely numerous, Plato means that “there is no ﬁ  nite number of  single things that exist” and yet one, as a part, is limited to the wholeness of that which it is a part ( Prm. 144e9–145a2). 12 At the end, Plato concludes that  “the one that is  (to hen . . . on ) . . . is both one and many, is a whole and has  parts, and is limited as well as inﬁ  nitely numerous.”13 In other words, Plato  explains that as far as being is concerned, number is limited to being; as far as number proper is concerned, number is inﬁ  nite. This symbiotic duality  between being and number, however, Aristotle does not recognize. Considering the straightforwardness of Plato’s reasoning, it is surprising  that Aristotle rejects the proposition that there can be both inﬁ  nitely many  numbers and no speciﬁ  c number representing inﬁ  nity, in spite of his promo- tion of the same line of thinking in Ph.207a33–b15. Consequently, he insis- tently argues that, if the Forms are numbers, then it is impossible for inﬁ  nite  8. Sayre’s quotation marks and italics ( 1996 :166,167). 9.

Aristotle misinterprets Prm. 143–144 as demonstrating Plato’s account of  the actual generation of numbers as if “numbers did not exist prior to this exercise in the Parmenides, ” as Sayre quips. 15 In fact, Parmenides only proves  that number is unity and that all number exists, although it comprises an inﬁ  - nitely numerous set. Aristotle, however, interprets this passage as describing the generation of number itself and concludes in Metaph. 1083b36–1084a4 that “there cannot be inﬁ  nite number because the generation of numbers is  a l w a y s  o f  a n  o d d  n u m b e r  o r  a n  e v e n  o n e . ” 16 I n  th i s  s t a t e m e n t ,  h e  c o n ﬂ  ates  Plato’s use of “inﬁ  nite multiplicity” ( apeiron plêthos ) and “inﬁ  nite number”  (apeiros arithmos ) in the Second Hypothesis in Parmenides . He considers the  latter as a reference to inﬁ  nite sets of numbers and the former as a represen- tation of Plato’s deduction that all number, including inﬁ  nite number, exists.17 Such combining of the ontological and mathematical aspects of Plato’s inﬁ  - nite number only conﬁ  rms Aristotle’s skepticism that number has a separate  ontological existence, but does not prove the fallacy of Plato’s position. Aristotle’s Criticism of Plato and the Platonists The section of the Metaphysics  that contains Aristotle’s criticism of Plato’s  inﬁ nite number18 is described by Annas as “an unconnected string of argu- ments beginning and ending abruptly and with no connecting topic.”19 This  evaluation points out the abrupt transitions in the ﬂ  ow of Aristotle’s argu- ment from disproving Plato’ s view to rejecting the Platonic theories of num-ber (both of which occupy about two-thirds of the chapter), and ﬁ  nally to  ending the section with a short and unsatisfactory exposition of his own view. Metaph .1083a–1084a concludes Aristotle’s criticism of Plato’s alleged  view that the Forms are numbers. 20 The debate about the relationship between  Forms and numbers originates from Aristotle’s representation of Plato’s position according to his unwritten doctrines rather than from an explicit  14.Ph. 206a21–206b33.

In R. 525c–d, Tht. 195d–196b, and Epin. 990c6,22 Plato  speculates that numbers participate in our intelligence and exist separately from the things that they enumerate. In the Sph. 238a10–11, the Eleatic  Stranger generalizes that “at any rate, we consider all number to be among  the things that exist.” 23 Based upon Plato’s works and especially the unwrit- ten doctrines, Aristotle synthesizes that Plato considers the mathematicals  as intermediaries between the Forms and their material copies. For exam-ple, the idea of a triangle is the same regardless of whether it is drawn on sand, molded on a piece of wood, or construed in our minds. As Merlan puts it, “mathematicals mediate between ideas and sensibles in that they share changelessness with the former, multiplicity with the latter.” 24 They  are ontologically superior to the physical world and yet, despite represent-ing unchangeable concepts, they are ontologically inferior to the Forms. If the Forms are numbers, then, the Form-numbers must differ both from numbers representing mathematical objects and from numbers enumerating physical multiplicity. Aristotle begins the discussion in Metaph. 1083a by asking whether there  is a difference between number, representing quantity, and monad, repre-senting quality. 25 If there is a difference, he speculates, the former would  represent quantity ( poson ), the latter quality ( poion ).26 In other words, the  Ideal Numbers should be distinguished not according to quantity ( kata to  poson ) but according to quality ( kata to poion ).27 Nevertheless, the distinction  21.

They have to be recovered  from indirect sources.” 22. Regarding the Epinomis,  I follow the scholarship on the subject, which  traditionally leaves aside the problem of Plato’s authorship. 23.Sph. 238a10:ériymÚn dØ tÚn sÊmpanta t«n ˆntvn t€yemen . 24.

Aristotle’s distinction between mathematical and ideal number is not  analytical but hypothetical. His chief complaint lies in the origin of num- bers, which he believes must be quantitative, not qualitative. The monad, without quality of its own, cannot produce qualitatively different numbers, whereas the indeﬁ  nite dyad can produce the numbers only quantitatively ( ou  poion hê de posopoion ). 30 At any rate, it seems that Aristotle wants to promote  the position that, if numbers are separate ontological entities, they must have  separate quality, not quantity. Thus he looks for a distinction based upon ontological difference. Such a distinction, however, is impossible, accord-ing to him, because it supposes that they are primary substances. From the Categories  and the Metaphysics,  we know that he considered substance prior  to the categories of quality, quantity, and rest. 31 Therefore neither quality  nor quantity could produce the primary ontological difference in numbers, because each one of them includes the deﬁ  nition of substance in their being,  whereas the deﬁ  nition of substance does not include any of them. I will later  return to discuss the implications of Aristotle’s view on quantity as a category for Plotinus’ concept of number. 32 For now it should sufﬁ  ce to say that, in the  discussion of quantity and quality in  Metaph. 1083a, Aristotle concludes that  quantity, and not quality, is the differentiating element in number.

In one sentence, he judges Xenocrates’ theory to be the worst because it supposes that the Form-numbers and the mathematical numbers are the same. 36 After dismissing these theories, he states somewhat  approvingly that the Pythagoreans’ view is more sound because it does not separate numbers from things but instead postulates that physical things are  numbers. Subsequently, he refutes this view, too, by explaining that, since  things have magnitudes and magnitudes are divisible, 37 whereas mathemati- cal number represents abstract units and therefore is indivisible, things can-not be made of numbers because there are no indivisible magnitudes. If we consider these criticisms in the context of his distinction between  mathematical number and ideal number in  Metaph. 1083a, discussed earlier,  it becomes clear that Aristotle is uncomfortable with the subject because he does not offer an explanation of his own after he lists his objections. In Metaph. 1083a1–20, he insists that the difference between the two numbers  is quantitative and not qualitative, since quantity implies that units comprise number, while quality, pertaining to an object’s nature without regard to quantity or size, implies indivisibility. In Metaph. 1083b8–17, however, he  s w i t c h e s  t h e  a r g u m e n t  f r o m  q u a n t i t a t i v e  n u m b e r s  t o  m a g n i t u d e s  t o  s h o w  that the quantitative numbers are also indivisible when compared to magni-tudes because they represent abstract units. Thus, he concludes, “the arith-metic number is monadic.” 38 The question of the origin of number permeates Aristotle’s discussion  and forms the core of his disagreement with Plato. The question of whether the Ideal Numbers derive from the monad or from the dyad ﬁ  rst appears  in Metaph. 1083a11–12 and is modiﬁ  ed in Metaph. 1083b23–25 as to how all  numbers derive from “the great and the small.” 39 If th e y d o , h e s pecula t es,  they can either originate from “the great and the small” or separately come  from “the great” and “the small.” On the one hand, it is impossible to come from the latter because some numbers would come only from the great and others only from the small. Thus, the monads would be characterized as  35.Metaph. 1083a24–27. Aristotle’s reference to Plato here should be taken  more as a sarcastic note than as a genuine installment in his argument. 36.Metaph. 1083b1–3,1086 a5–11.

On the other hand, numbers cannot come from the  former, because numbers, as separate entities, would be indistinguishable from one another, if they come from the equalized principles of the great and the small. But above all, the problem is that the monad is prior to the dyad and it acts like a form of a Form. But what does the monad come from, if the Indeﬁ  nite Dyad produces two, and not the monad? Aristotle’s  questioning and the famous remark about the Indeﬁ  nite Dyad ( aoristos dyas ) as two-maker ( dyopoios ) in Metaph. 1083b36 demonstrate the contradiction  within his mathematical approach of explaining the Ideal Numbers. When he points out that the monad is prior to the dyad, he is as close as he can get to making the j um p from a mathemati cal to an on to logi cal perspecti v e . Bu t he cannot make this jump because, for him, number is not a being ( to on ), nor even substance ( ousia ). Instead, he escapes his ontological stalemate by  calling the Indeﬁ  nite Dyad “inﬁ  nite number.” 40 In Metaph. 1084a7–9, Aristotle questions how there can be a Form of  inﬁ nite number, if the inﬁ  nite number cannot be limited by a Form or a sen- sible body.41 Annas suggests that Aristotle’s criticism stems from the inter- pretation that the Platonists view inﬁ  nity as actual and not potential.42 His  own understanding from Ph. 207a33–b15 is that the inﬁ  nite cannot exist in  actuality because ( 1) “it cannot be gone through, as in the case of voice, which  is invisible” and ( 2) “it cannot be traversed” because “that which admits of  being traversed has no end” ( Ph. 204a1–4).43 He deduces that, since inﬁ  nity  is unlimited, inﬁ  nity is potentiality: That the inﬁ  nite does not exist in actuality has been already stated,  but it exists by division; . . . Accordingly, we are left with the alterna-tive that the inﬁ  nite exists potentially. ( Ph. 206a16–18) 44 Rist, in his seminal article “The Indeﬁ  nite Dyad and Intelligible Matter in  Plotinus,” cogently argues that Aristotle mistakenly takes the Indeﬁ  nite Dyad  as two separate things, as we saw above in his use of “the great and the small,”  rather than “the potentiality of plurality,” which leads to “his own mistaken v i e w  o f  t h e  P l a t o n i c  g e n e r a t i o n  o f  I d e a l  N u m b e r s . ” 45 E v e n  b e f o r e  A n n a s  a n d   Rist, Ross shows exhaustively that Aristotle misses the mark in understanding  40.Metaph. 1083b36–37. 41.

In other words, Aristotle chooses to examine the wrong patient with the wrong tools, and consequently comes up  with the wrong diagnosis. By treating the Indeﬁ  nite Dyad as inﬁ  nite number,  he examines the Ideal Numbers from the perspective of the arithmetical num- bers and concludes that the former are nonsensical. 48 Aristotle’s criticism in Metaph. 1083a–b, therefore, crystallizes the con- ceptual differences between the two camps and puts Aristotle’s mathematical approach in opposition to the Platonic ontological approach. All later phi- l oso p h e rs , es peciall y in th e P la t o ni c tradi ti o n , ha v e had t o gra p p l e wi th th e issue. Plotinus is no exception to this rule. Plotinus’ Answer Given Plato’s ambiguous expression of “inﬁ  nite number” in Prm. 144a6 and  Aristotle’s reference to it in Metaph. 1083b36–37, it is not surprising that  Plotinus himself, after deﬁ  ning multiplicity, tackles the question of “the so- called number of inﬁ  nity.”49 The use of the participle “so-called” ( legomenos ) in VI. 6.2.150 resonates with both Plato’s expression and Aristotle’s refutation  of it and reveals Plotinus’ awareness of the issue.51 While Aristotle seeks to  decipher Plato’s inﬁ  nite number through mathematical logic,52 Plotinus ﬁ  nds  the answer in Plato’s ontology. But, while Aristotle understands the origin of  46. Cf. R.525c–d, Tht. 195d–196b, Epin. 990c6. Ross ( 1924 : vol. 1 ,157–177);  Annas ( 1976 :4); Cleary ( 1995:346–389 ). 47.

But while the  Neopythagoreans accept the fusion of mathematics and ontology and bring it  to a different conceptual level, Aristotle, although abrogating the fusion, uses  mathematics for the study of ontology. 49.

Aristotle disproves, in Metaph. 1083b36–1084a17, the  claim that number is either ﬁ  nite or inﬁ  nite.54 First, he dismisses the pre- m i s e  t h a t  n u m b e r  i s  ﬁ  nite by stating that, if the original numbers run up  to ten only,55 then the Forms would quickly run out of numbers to repre- sent the original things. For example, if the number three is inherent in the Form of man, there will be no numbers for the Form of horse or the Form of anything else. Also, were three to be the Form of man, it follows that all o th e r thr ees will r e p r esen t I d eas o f man , w hi c h, in turn , will l ead t o an inﬁ n i t e  n u m b e r  o f  m e n  ( apeiroi esontai anthrôpoi ). 56 O n c e  a g a i n ,  A r i s t o t l e   contradictorily examines the Ideal Numbers on the basis of the properties of mathematical numbers. By forcing the former to behave mathematically, he “shows” the impossibility of the Ideal Number Three. Aristotle’s refutation of the proposition that number is inﬁ  nite, how- ever, is of greater interest to us because Plotinus responds to it in VI. 6.2. In Metaph. 1084a1–10, he explains that number cannot be inﬁ  nite for math- ematical and ontological reasons. Mathematically, when generated, num-ber must be either odd or even. Ontologically, if Forms are numbers, there must be a Form of the inﬁ  nite too. The latter, Aristotle argues, is deﬁ  nitely  wrong, because the Platonists conceive the Forms as deﬁ  nite, not indeﬁ  nite. 57 Ironically, he gets the ontological reasoning right only quickly to disregard it.  But his mathematical rationale is surprisingly skewed. He refuses to accept the possibility that there could be a series of inﬁ  nitely many numbers ( n) without determining a ﬁ  nite quantity for n. His refusal is particularly strik- ing since he accepts the same proposition in Ph.207a33–b15. 53. II.4.3–5; III.8.11; V.3.11. 54. Actually, Aristotle ﬁ  rst says “inﬁ  nite” ( apeiros [arithmos ]) and then  “ﬁ nite” ( peperasmenos ), but I have reversed the order because his reasoning on  the inﬁ  nite number leads to the next major point in my analysis. 55. A reference to the Pythagorean view, also held by Plato ( Metaph. 1088 b10) and Speusippus ( Metaph. 1028 b21–24), that the numbers from one to  ten are the Ideal Numbers that participate in the construction of the universe  through the tetractys ( Metaph. 986a8–9).

I disagree, however, that Plotinus  summarizes this section in response to Aristotle’s mathematical discussion of inﬁ  nite number in the Physics.  Instead, I think that Plotinus uses the  passage in the Physics  to highlight Aristotle’s tendentious discussion in  Metaph. 1084a. In VI. 6.2, Plotinus uses Aristotle’s view in the Physics  only  to refute Aristotle’s analysis of the Indeﬁ  nite Dyad in the Metaphysics. That Aristotle equates the Indeﬁ  nite Dyad with inﬁ  nite number in  Metaph. 1083b35–37 has great signiﬁ  cance for the bigger picture of Plotinus’  argument in VI. 6. While the second chapter of VI. 6 rejects Aristotle’s inter- pretation of the Indeﬁ  n i t e  D y a d  a s  “ i n ﬁ  nite number,” the third chapter  presents the Indeﬁ  nite Dyad as the principle of limit and unlimited in the  intelligible realm. 59 The juxtaposition of the two chapters heightens their  conceptual opposition. It also strongly suggests that Plotinus had Aristotle’s original opposition of the two concepts in Metaph. 1083b35–37 in mind.  Additionally, the juxtaposition of chapters 2 and 3 bluntly exposes Aristotle’s  confusion. The arithmetical behavior of number is certainly a minor concern for  Plotinus. Because Aristotle treats inﬁ  n i t e  n u m b e r  a s  a  m a t h e m a t i c a l  n u m - ber, Plotinus ﬁ  rst refutes the proposition that number proper originates in  physical reality or in mathematical theory. With his reference to Aristotle’s use of abstract manipulation in Ph. 208a15–20, 60 Plotinus also echoes Plato’s  so-called two and three machine in  Prm. 143d8–e7,61 which demonstrates  58.

(VI. 6.2.8–10) For him, the true nature of number is ontological, not quantitative, and the origin of number is in the intelligible realm and not a result of man’s intel-lectual mathematical operations. The passage has crucial importance for Plotinus’ understanding of the origin of number in the intelligible because i t  i n t r o d u c e s  n u m b e r  a s  p o s s e s s i n g  t h e  c h a r a c t e r i s t i c s  o f  b e i n g : 63 i t  i s  l i m - ited ( hôristai ) and therefore exists ( hestêken ). This compatibility makes num- ber and being commensurate in the same way that Plato makes number and  being equinumerous in Prm. 144d1–145a.64 For Plotinus, the unity of being  and number stems from the unity of “the existence” and “the oneness” of  Plato’s second hypothesis. Plotinus reasons toward the existence of the Indeﬁ  nite Dyad in the  intelligible by considering two ways in which inﬁ  nity can exist.65 The ﬁ  rst  supposes that inﬁ  nity exists in the intelligible by suggesting the absurd prop- osition that inﬁ  nity is an intelligible being.66 The second presumes that inﬁ  n- ity exists not in the intelligible realm but only in sensible reality. Naturally, Plotinus focuses on the ﬁ  rst hypothesis. Because inﬁ  nity  is unlimited, it both needs to be limited and shies away from the idea of limit. 67 And yet, when inﬁ  n i t y  i s  c a u g h t  b y  l i m i t ,68 “place comes into exis- tence” ( hypestê topos,  VI.6.3.18).

(VI. 6.3.28–30) The passage explains the principal difference between Aristotle and Plotinus and elucidates why Aristotle’s explanation of the Indeﬁ  nite Dyad is wrong  from the Platonic point of view. 69 Aristotle considers the Indeﬁ  nite Dyad  as two things, which he ﬁ  rst calls “quantity-maker” ( posopoios ) in Metaph. 1083a13 and later redeﬁ  nes as “two-maker” ( dyopoios ) in Metaph. 1083b36. The former represents the Indeﬁ  nite Dyad as a mechanism that generates  quantity in general, which Aristotle quickly rejects as impossible.70 This  rejection forces him to interpret the Indeﬁ  nite Dyad as some sort of mathe- matical doubling mechanism that does not create multiplicity in general but  only twos.71 For Plotinus, on the other hand, “the great and the small” do not  produce quantity, but represent the pair of the principles of rest and motion (hestôs kai kinoumenon ), possessing the characteristics of stability ( stasis ) and  innate motion ( symphytos kinêsis ) inherent in Numenius’ First God. It is not until Syrianus’ commentary on Aristotle’s treatment of num- ber that Aristotle’s confusion is resolved. Proclus’ teacher explicitly talks  about the Indeﬁ  nite Dyad qua principle, which is “the author for all things  of generative power and procession ( proodos ) and multiplicity ( plêthos ) and  multiplication.” 72 According to him, the Indeﬁ  nite Dyad ﬁ  lls every level of  reality (divine, intelligible, psychic, natural, and sensible) with the numbers proper to it. Syrianus articulates the concept of the Indeﬁ  nite Dyad as a pri- mary originative principle of the numbers that govern every level of reality. But Plotinus cannot speak with such clarity on the subject because he needs ﬁ rst and foremost to establish that number has ontological meaning and to  distinguish intelligible from arithmetical number. Most likely he has in mind Syrianus’ conceptual goal, but what we ﬁ  nd in VI. 6.3 and elsewhere in the 69.

The dis- cussion in VI. 6.3 is not intended to depict the full picture, but only to reject  Aristotle’s quantitative interpretation of the Dyad. VI. 6.3 ends with the notion  that the Indeﬁ  nite Dyad is a principle pertinent to the intelligible realm. He  further elucidates this position by explaining that “what is called number in  the intelligible world and the dyad are rational principles ( logoi ) and Intellect  (nous)” in V. 1.5.13–14.

In chapter 1 , we discussed the ﬁ  rst separation, in which Intellect con- templates itself as an image of the One in multiplicity.74 The thaumastic  nature of this paradox stems from the two activities of the One. The internal activity, which the One directs toward itself, prevents it from losing any part of itself in its productivity. The external activity, directed toward the Second Hypostasis, reveals itself to Intellect as its own multiplicity. 75 Through self- contemplation, Intellect instantiates itself as many ( ho nous houtos ho polys ) and perceives the One as multiplicity.76 Thus, the thinking of Intellect is the  actual activity of the Indeﬁ  nite Dyad, which produces multiplicity.77 So, what is the role of the intelligible numbers and the Indeﬁ  nite  Dyad in this ﬁ  rst act of separation? Although Plotinus introduces them in  the above order in V. 1.5, in our examination, we need to reverse this order  because the Indeﬁ  n i t e  D y a d  b e l o n g s  t o  “ t h e  e f ﬂ  uence from the One when  it ﬁ rst appears, before it has returned in contemplation upon its source and  become informed,”78 whereas the intelligible numbers pertain to the informed  Intellect seeing its manyness. In V. 1.5, we ﬁ  nd that this is the actual order of  separation from the One: For number is not primary: the One is prior to the dyad, but the dyad is secondary, and originating from the One, has it as deﬁ  ner,  but is itself of its own nature indeﬁ  nite; but when it is deﬁ  ned, it is  73. This process took about two centuries. 74. See pp. 35–36. 75. Here I am happy to use Emilsson’s lucid analysis of the double activity  of the One ( 2007 :22–30).

(V. 1.5.6–9) The passage not only contributes to the standard postulate in Plotinian meta- physics that the One is metaphysically prior and thus superior to the Indeﬁ  nite  Dyad and the intelligible numbers, but also clariﬁ  es the relationship between  the Indeﬁ  ni t e Dy ad an d th e in t e lli gi b l e n um be rs . N o t e tha t h e o nl y sa ys tha t  the One is prior to the Indeﬁ  nite Dyad. He does not say that the Indeﬁ  nite  Dyad is prior to the intelligible numbers. The Indeﬁ  nite Dyad and the intel- ligible numbers are at an equal metaphysical level. The former is the indef-inite ( aoristos,  V.1.5.8), shapeless ( amorphos,  II.4.4.20) productive efﬂ  uence  from the One resulting in movement and otherness from the One ( kinêsis kai  heterotês ). 79 He also compares it to darkness ( aphôtistos,  II.4.5.35) or “unformed  sight” ( atypôtos opsis,  V.3.11.12). The latter is a result of Intellect’s contempla- tion of itself and the unity of the One as many, deﬁ  ned by intelligible number.80 Thus, Plotinus carefully distinguishes between the Indeﬁ  nite Dyad and intel- ligible number as pertinent to the pre-Intellect and post-Intellect respectively. Because intelligible number deﬁ  nes the indeﬁ  nite nature of the Dyad, in con- trast to Speusippus, Plotinus does not talk about the Indeﬁ  nite Dyad as multi- plicity ( plêthos ), because, for him, the intelligible number itself is multiplicity. The passage in V. 1.5 also answers the pressing question of whether the  One itself is number. 81 The One is not number internally, but it externally  manifests itself as number, when Intellect contemplates the One. This dis-tinction enables Plotinus to specify that the One is not counted at all: “for it is a measure and not measured, and it is not equal to the other units s o  a s  t o  b e  o f  t h e i r  c o m p a n y . ” 82 This conclusion has major signiﬁ  cance for  understanding the structure of the intelligible realm. First, it preserves the  suprametaphysical state of the One. Second, it explains that the Indeﬁ  nite  Dyad is not n um ber ei ther . Third, i t suggests that in telligib le n um ber is an  e xp r ess i o n o f th e e xt ernal acti vi ty o f th e On e .

The unde- ﬁ ned nature of the Dyad carries the potentiality of existence85 and intelligible  matter,86 while the deﬁ  ned nature of intelligible number presents the actu- ality of existence in VI. 6.9.28.87 Consequently, intelligible number becomes  being and substance ( arithmos de hôs ousia,  V.1.5.9).88 The explication of the  last result, of course, deserves its own chapter, following next. Let us combine this discussion about the Indeﬁ  nite Dyad and intelligible  number with the analysis of the previous two chapters. In chapter 1, we exam- ined the origin of Plotinus’ presentation of multiplicity, although in reversed  order, from the Timaeus.  We pointed out the thaumastic element in Plato’s  conception of the Forms imprinting themselves onto matter in the Receptacle and in Plotinus’ deﬁ  ni tion o f m ul ti p li ci ty as separation from th e One . While  Plato describes the Demiurge’s work ordering the primordial chaos of the primary elements in numerical proportions ( Ti.36a–37d), Plotinus makes  intelligible number, as an agent of the external activity of the One, deﬁ  ne  and order the unlimited nature of the Dyad into being and substance. In the  ﬁ rst separation from the One, “the One gives what it does not itself possess:  multiplicity.” 89 Therefore, Plotinus’ treatment of the relationship between the  Indeﬁ  nite Dyad and intelligible number conﬁ  rms the ﬁ  nding of chapter 2 that  multiplicity is number. Multiplicity exists in the intelligible only as Number.90 The Indeﬁ  nite Dyad and intelligible number also relate to the two directions  in multiplicity. At the intelligible level, the outward direction represents the  indeﬁ  nite, preinformed nature of the Dyad, while its inward direction repre- sents the deﬁ  ned and informed nature of intelligible number. The discussions of the number of inﬁ  nity in VI. 6.2 and the Indeﬁ  nite  Dyad in VI. 6.3 expose Aristotle’s misinterpretation of the Indeﬁ  nite Dyad  and place the origin of number in the intelligible realm. As Plotinus says, quantitative number is only an image ( eidôlon arithmou, VI. 6.2.13) of the true  existence of number in the intelligible and should not be the subject of inves-tigation. VI. 6.2–3 establishes that number and being are inseparable. 84. III.8.11. 85. V.3.11. 86. II.4.5, III.8.11.

How  does the Indeﬁ  nite Dyad relate to substance ( ousia ) and to the hypostases  of Intellect and Soul? How does intelligible number impose limit on the  unlimited? Exactly what is the nature of intelligible number? Let us follow Plotinus’ train of thought that examines each of these  questions in the central chapter of VI. 6. The refutation of Aristotle’s view  of the number of inﬁ  nity in VI. 6.2–3 not only defends the Platonic “true  numbers,” but also univocally denies place for mathematical number in the intelligible realm. The discussion of the Indeﬁ  nite Dyad’ s relation to intelli- gible number places number at the level of the ﬁ  rst Monad and Being. This  view requires much consideration as it is at the heart of Plotinus’ ontology and represents a new step in the theoretical debate between Aristotle and the Platonic concept of number. In his anti-Aristotelian argument, Plotinus does not distinguish intelli- gible number and mathematical number terminologically; instead, he expects the reader to understand which one he is referring to by the context of the argument. For the sake of clarity, I will refer to number in the intelligi-ble realm as “intelligible number,” adopting Plotinus’ single use of noêtos  arithmos  in V. 9.11.13. As Charles-Saget notes the term is ambiguous because  it implies both the existence of number in the intelligible realm and the plurality of Forms themselves, 1 but again, it is usually possible to discern  from the context which one is meant. Since, at this point of VI. 6, Plotinus  c o m p l e t e l y  e n t e r s  i n t o  t h e  d i s c u s s i o n  o f  n u m b e r  a s  p a r t  o f  t h e  i n t e l l i g i b l e ,  the term intelligible number best captures the main focus in the rest of the treatise. As the argument progresses, he speciﬁ  cally uses arithmos to mean  1. Charles-Saget ( 1980 :42): Cette incertitude où nous demeurons à l’égard  du sens du nombre intelligible (c ’est-à-dire du nombre ‘qui est dans ’ l’intelligible,  car ‘intelligible’ jusqu’ici ne qualiﬁ  e pas le nombre, ne l’éclaire pas, il le situe </p><div id="pagenum"><p>simplement) n’est pas levée par une indication quelconque sur le sense de la pluralité dans les idées elles-mêmes .</p></div><div id="pagenum"><p>PLOTINUS ON NUMBER 72</p></div><p id="page">intelligible number, even after he deﬁ  nes it as “substantial number” ( ousiôdês  arithmos ) in VI. 6.9.34.2 In VI. 6.2–3, the two kinds of number are introduced indirectly by  explaining their major difference. He repeatedly states that “the generation  of number is not in the power of the one who counts, but it is already limited and stands fast,” that “in the intelligible, just as the real beings are limited so is the number limited to the real beings,” and that “what really exists and is, is already determined by number.”  3 These statements repeatedly establish  that intelligible number originates in and pertains to the intelligible realm.  Mathematical number, on the other hand, is mentioned only once as an image of intelligible number. 4 As a result, even without proper and explicit  terminology, the two types are characterized by the standard Platonic divi-sion of an intelligible paradigm and its physical copy. After alluding to the distinction between intelligible and mathematical  number in VI. 6.2, Plotinus abandons the latter and focuses on the former, since  “that which exists  and is,  has been already determined by number.”  5 In the dis- cussion of the order of separation from the One in V. 1.5.9, examined earlier,6 Plotinus explains that the One is prior to the Indeﬁ  nite Dyad and deﬁ  nes  the Dyad by number which is “as substance” ( hôs ousia ). The comparison  of number with substance elucidates the relationship between the Indeﬁ  nite  Dyad and intelligible number, but more important it establishes an ontologi-cal relationship between intelligible number and substance. Ontologically the use of hôs  in the sense of “as” in the phrase arithmos hôs ousia  does not sim- ply compare but equates number with substance within the Indeﬁ  nite Dyad.  Since number deﬁ  nes the unlimited nature of the principle of potentiality,  number induces limit and stability in the intelligible. Furthermore, since limit  and stability imply being, it follows that number must be being. This reason-ing leads Plotinus to conceive of number as substance. This brings us to the subject of the origin of Limit, Being, and the  absolute Monad. 7 In V. 1.5, Plotinus explains that the One is prior to the  Dyad and deﬁ  nes the Dyad by number. In V. 5.5, he further clariﬁ  es that  the deﬁ  ning activity of the One is the ﬁ  rst Monad, which is the principle of  Limit and gives beings substantial existence.8 Nikulin has pointed out that  the intelligible numbers come from the Monad and the Indeﬁ  nite Dyad.9 His  2.

If the absolute Monad is  the principle of the absolute Being and deﬁ  nes the Indeﬁ  nite Dyad in the  creation of the intelligible realm, then the Monad and the Indeﬁ  nite Dyad  produce not the intelligible numbers, but the multiplicity of beings as intel- ligible numbers. The Monad as the ﬁ  rst principle of being underlies the existence of  intelligible numbers. V. 5.4 clariﬁ  es that the One does not participate in num- ber but “when the dyad comes to be, the monad before the dyad exists.” 10 The monad in number participates in the ﬁ  rst Monad as the principle of  existence that represents both unity and individuality. For example, the  two units in the dyad and the wholeness of the dyad both participate in the  monad but in different ways. The dyad is one as a unity and the two units in the dyad are each an individual unit, which is one as a unity. As Plotinus says, an army and a house are one in a different way. 11 A house is one “in  virtue of its continuous structure,” while an army is one as a discrete unity. Like a house, the dyad is one in virtue of its continuity, while the number two is one as a discrete unity. The Aristotelian origin of the distinction between continuous and dis- crete will be discussed later, in the examination of the primary kinds in VI.2–3. 12 Here it is important to understand Plotinus’ point that, while both  a house and an army participate in the monad, the monad itself does not  participate in them, but beings acquire their unity and individuality by par- ticipation in the monad.13 The monad represents one as the unity and the  limit in being.14 The discussion of the relationship between being and number raises the  question of how intelligible number relates to the Forms. Plotinus considers three possible ways: 15 The posterior hypothesis (H1. 1 ): if each F orm is numbered after  it comes into existence, then number is posterior to the Forms  (epiginomenos,  VI.6.4.3–6). 10.

Nikulin ( 2002 :74–80) analytically construes Plotinus’ concept of number  without discussing the concept within the structure of the argument in VI. 6. His  interpretation is rather concise and does not examine every detail of Plotinus’  argument, such as the disproof of H 1 and H 2 or the discussion that intelligible </p><div id="pagenum"><p>number is not incidental.</p></div><div id="pagenum"><p>PLOTINUS ON NUMBER 74</p></div><p id="page">The simultaneous hypothesis (H2. 2 ): number is created along with each  Form ( synegennêthê,  VI.6.4.6–7). The anterior hypothesis (H3. 3 ): number is conceived in and of itself  (autos eph’ heautou ho arithmos enoêthê,  VI.6.4.10).16 In o r d er t o un d erstan d th e h ypo th eses co rrectl y , w e m ust remin d o urse l v es  that the temporal distinctions used in expressing relations in the intelligible realm are actually atemporal. 17 The notion of time in the intelligible is only  a coping mechanism of our dianoetic thinking in conveying the relations of metaphysical superiority and dependency. The above hypotheses, thus, investigate whether number is, respectively, metaphysically inferior, equal, or superior to the Forms. Recalling Plato’s distinction between numbers enumerating sense- perceptible things and numbers representing higher mathematical con-cepts, Plotinus attempts to answer the above hypotheses through Plato. 18 In  VI.6.4.20–25, he paraphrases the explanation in Ti.39b–c that “men came to  the idea of number by the alternation of day and night.” 19 The reference illus- trates the fact that numbers simply measure the differences between things.20 He further expounds that, according to Plato, soul enumerates things when they enter into soul by perceiving them as different. This view supports the posterior hypothesis (H 1) that numbers are inferior to the things they count  and, in the context of the intelligible realm, below the Forms. 21 On the other hand, in VI. 6.4.20–25, he recalls Plato’s R. 529d2–4, which  e xp lains tha t tru e as tr o n o m y is co n ce rn ed wi th “m o ti o ns tha t ar e r eall y f as t or slow as measured in true number ( en tôi alêthinôi arithmôi ), delineate true  16. Nikulin ( 2002 :74–75) counts four hypotheses: the number may be either  after, together with, or independent of the Forms and subdivides the last one into  number being independent “either before or after the Forms.” The last bifurcation,  although important to the nature of intelligible number, does not need to be counted as two separate hypotheses as it refers to the single premise that number is prior to  the Forms. Therefore, with Charles-Saget ( 1980:41–42), I count three hypotheses. 17. I should also add space. But, since the three above hypotheses do not  include spatial reference, I have left it out from the main text. 18. Charles-Saget ( 1980 :42). 19. Continued in Ti.47a. On Plotinus’ mind most likely are also the  creation of time as “an eternal image, moving according to number, of eternity  remaining in unity” ( Ti.37d5–7) and the alternating motions of the sun and the  moon ( Ti.38a7–8). 20. III.7.12.31–33: “. . . The god made day and night by means of which, in  virtue of their difference, it was possible to grasp the idea of two, and from this  [Plato] says, came the concept of number.” 21.

Regarding astronomy, Plato completely dismisses the knowledge acquired by the senses and argues that real astrono-mers, that is, the ones with a strong philosophical bent, do not study the visible appearance of the heavenly bodies’ movements, but their intellectual counterparts. The incorporeal mathematical abstractions occupy an interme-diate position between the Forms and their physical copies, although they are closer to the former than to the latter. 23 By “true numbers” and “true ﬁ  gures,”  Plato means abstract numbers, which lead us closer to the understanding of “the colorless, shapeless, and invisible being,” as described in the Phaedrus. 24 Thus, Plato’s true numbers are closer to H 2 and H 3 rather than H 1. In mentioning Plato’s true numbers, Plotinus’ goal is apparently to place  number in the intelligible realm. He achieves this in a peculiar, convoluted, yet still important manner: But then when Plato says “in the true number” ( en tôi alêthinôi arith- môi), and speaks of the number in substance ( ton arithmon en ousiai),  he will, on the other hand, be saying that number has an existence from itself ( hypostasin tina an aph’ heautou tou arithmou ) and does not have  its existence in the numbering soul ( ouk en têi arithmousêi hyphistasthai  psychêi ) but the soul stirs up in itself from the difference in sensible  things the idea of number ( ennoian tou arithmou ). (VI. 6.4.20–25) Plotinus introduces Plato’s true numbers as the alternative to the posterior hypothesis (H1 ). In addi tion, he explains that P lato speaks of them as “n um- bers in substance” and as “existence from itself. ” But Plato does not associate  the true numbers with substance ( ousia ) in the passage Plotinus refers to in  the Republic.

Indeed, he coins his own term, such as “ Form al number” ( eidêtikos arithmos ), to signify Plato’s Form-numbers. Plotinus, on  the other hand, speciﬁ  cally quotes Plato’s “true number” to show his reception  of Plato’s view, while he does not even once use Aristotle’s “ Form al number.” Plotinus’ interpretation of Plato’s true numbers, in VI. 6, has three impor- tant ideas with programmatic signiﬁ  cance for the concept of the substantial  number. First, according to him, by “true numbers,” Plato means “number in substance” ( ton arithmon en ousiai). 26 This interpretation entirely shifts  the true number from the realm of mathematicals, as intermediaries between the Forms and the physical reality, to the intelligible realm. Second, the explanation that number is in substance leads to the major conclusion that “number has an existence from itself and does not have its existence in the numbering soul,”  27 w hi ch p laces su bstan tial n um ber in In tellect. Thir d, th e  above point allows Plotinus to specify that the soul enumerates by stirring up in itself the idea of number , which in turn suggests that number belongs to a higher ontological level than the individual soul. 28 Plotinus’ interpretation of Plato’s true numbers, then, points to H 2 and  H3 in VI. 6.4: that number is either simultaneous and equal to the Forms  (H2) or prior and superior to the Forms (H 3). Is Substantial Number Discrete and Incidental? VI.6.5 begins the analysis of the hypotheses by modifying the main question  about the relationship between number and substance to a question about the nature of number itself: What, then, is the nature of number? Is it an accompaniment ( para- kolouthêma ) of each substance and something observed in it ( epi- theôroumenon hekastêi ousiai )—man and one man ( anthrôpos kai heis  25. In his late period, Plato himself might have distinguished between  true numbers and mathematical numbers as reported by Aristotle, Metaph . 1080 b11–14,1083b1–2, and Syrianus, In Metaph .186.30–36. Annas ( 1976 :69–72);  Nikulin ( 2002 :73). 26. VI.6.4.21. Plotinus’ “substantial number” denotes both Plato’s “being”  and Aristotle’s “substance,” as discussed in the rest of the chapter. 27. VI.6.4.21–23. 28. I believe Plotinus is speaking about the individual soul here as his  point is to deny the sense-perceptible origin of number, although he would have </p><div id="pagenum"><p>expressed a similar thought about the universal Soul, too.</p></div><div id="pagenum"><p>NUMBER AND SUBSTANCE 77</p></div><p id="page">anthrôpos ), for instance, and being and one being ( on kai hen on ), and so with all the individual intelligibles and the whole of number  (ta panta hekasta ta noêta kai pas ho arithmos )? But how is there a  dyad and a triad, and how are all uniﬁ  ed, and how could such and such number be brought together into one? (VI. 6.5.1–5) The ﬁ  nal questions seem to retract the conclusion that was reached at the end of VI. 6.4 and reexamine H 1. If number is metaphysically infe- rior to substance, number would accompany substance as it distinguishes  particulars from universals: a man from man, one being from being, the  whole number of beings from all beings. 29 But such reasoning follows the  rules of mathematical number, which counts things discretely. It does not, however, relate to substantial number, because the nature of substantial num-ber possesses internal unity, 30 which must not be discrete but indiscrete.31 This reasoning supports the text of V. 5.4.28–35, discussed earlier,32 that  the monad has substantial unity ( kata to hôs einai hen ), which is  different  from the unity of the things that are predicates of it. Take the dyad, for  example, Plotinus insists. What is the inseparable unity of the dyad?33 O b v i o u s l y ,  i t  i s  n o t  “ t w o  p o w e r s  b r o u g h t  t o g e t h e r ,  a s  i f  c o m p o s e d  i n t o  one,”  34 because, if it were, the substantial number would be simply multi- plicity of units ( plêthos henadôn ).35 Substantial number then would be like  mathematical number, composite and without inherent unity, except in  the case of the monad, which is “simple one” ( to haploun hen ) inherently  possessing unity.36 Plotinus’ argument revisits Aristotle’s question about the difference  between number and monad (unit) in Metaph. 1083a.37 Aristotle thought  29.

This one is the monad as unity, not the absolute One, which does not relate to  anything, oÈ kat' êllo (V. 5.4.7). 31. The topic of the substantial unity leads to the discussion of Intellect  as “one nature” in VI. 6.7.

Since he perceives the difference  between number and monad to be only quantitative and not qualitative, he  dismisses the qualitative distinction between them as nonsensical ( alogon ).38 Plotinus also looks, although not as explicitly as Aristotle, for the same dis-tinction. Just as Aristotle uses mathematical concepts to deny the ontological meaning of number, Plotinus uses mathematical language to deny the arith-metical characteristics of substantial number. First, he compares substan-t i a l  n u m b e r  t o  m u l t i p l i c i t y  o f  h e n a d s ,  r e c a l l i n g  t h e  m a t h e m a t i c a l  d e ﬁ  nition  of number proper. 39 Second, he explains the dyad as a composite number  (synthetos arithmos ).40 Neither attempt, however, satisﬁ  es him as demonstrat- ing the internal and inseparable unity of substantial numbers. This series of failed attempts reinforces the invalidity of Aristotle’s conclusion about the quantitative nature of number and points at Plotinus’ ontological interpreta-tion of substantial number. In this light, once again H 1 p r o v e s  t o  b e  f a l s e .   For him, number does not count substance in the intelligible realm. Next, Plotinus turns to the Pythagorean analogical understanding of  numbers ( arithmoi ek tou analogon ) in order to exemplify what kind of unity  substantial number has. 41 For example, the Pythagoreans speak of the tet- rad as absolute justice (VI. 6.5.10–12).42 The inherent unity of the tetrad is  c o n v e y e d  b y  th e  i n d i vi s i b i l i ty  o f  th e  a b s tr a c t  c o n c e p t  o f  j u s ti c e .

Moderatus deﬁ  nes number as systema monadôn (see pp. 43 –44) whereas Euclid deﬁ  nes it as “multiplicity composed of units” ( tÚ §k monãdvn  sugke€menon pl∞yow ,El. bk. 7 , def. 2 , bk. 9 , def. 22 ), which is used by both  mathematicians and philosophers later. Plotinus’ choice of henads in the place of  monads is peculiar, but we cannot make much of it for now since he is usually inexact in his quotations. Xenocrates, however, speaks of “multiplicity from  absolute henads” ( pl∞yow §j •nãdvn élhyin«n ) and explains that we do not  use henads in regard to individual bodies (fr. 260, Isnardi Parente). Damascius  is able to distinguish between the two: “number is composed of many units whereas multiplicity is composed of henads” ( §k monãdvn går poll«n ı  ériymÒw, tÚ d¢ pl∞yow §j •nãdvn sumplhroËtai ,De Principiis 129.19). 40. Euclid, El.7, def. 14 ; Aristotle, Metaph .1020 b4. 41. VI.6.5.11. 42. Most likely, according to Armstrong ( 1988 :21), Plotinus refers to  Aristotle’s treatment of the Pythagorean doctrines in Metaph .985b23–986b8 rather than to their original sources. On the Pythagorean tetrad, see Theol.  Ar.29: “Anatolius reports that it is called ‘justice,’ since the square (i.e., the  area) which is based on it is equal to the perimeter” (trans. Waterﬁ  eld). For </p><div id="pagenum"><p>the mathematical details of the concept in Pythagoras, Plato, and Aristotle, see Ausland ( 2006 :107–123).</p></div><div id="pagenum"><p>NUMBER AND SUBSTANCE 79</p></div><p id="page">certain abstract meaning to the individual numbers, the Pythagoreans denote  the nonquantitative nature of number. Following the Pythagorean method, we may suppose that the unity of the dyad does not come from the quantitative addition of two units but is inseparable from the absolute idea of the dyad. The analogy suggests that the dyad, the triad, and the tetrad in the intelligi-ble are not different from the Form of whiteness, man, or anything else. The discussion of number as substance invites the question of whether  number is incidental to the Forms ( symbebêkos ), and thus referring to H 2. 43 Charles-Saget acknowledges the Aristotelian tone of the section only in passing . 44 Her cursory note, however, stems from the expository style of Plotinus’  text itself. Plotinus begins by explaining that number is not incidental to the Forms, just as absolute movement is essential and not incidental. To distin-guish essential ( kata to ti estin ) and incidental movement ( symbebêkos ), he  refers to the discussion of time and movement in III. 7.12, which clariﬁ  es  that time measures the movement of the universe, and not movement per se. Movement per se is a being and thus essential, while movement observed in a thing is incidental. He concludes that substantial number is not altogether incidental ( oude symbebêkos holôs ), since even incidentals must be something  b e f o r e  t h e y  i n c i d e n t a l l y  o c c u r . 45 This conclusion is exempliﬁ  ed in VI. 3.6 w h e r e  h e  e x p l a i n s  t h a t  “ t h e  w h i t e ”  p e r  s e  i s  b e i n g  ( to leukon on ) indepen- d e n t l y  f r o m  t h e  t h i n g s  t o  w h i c h  i t  i s  i n c i d e n t a l ,  s u c h  a s  “ w h i t e  S o c r a t e s ”   or “white thing.” 46 Therefore there must be a real existence of whiteness,  although the color white is only observed in things.47 Even if number, like  the color white, is inseparable from the things it is predicated of, number also must precede man and being, and every thing of which it is predicate. 48 Thus, the simultaneous hypothesis (H 2) is invalid: And [Number] is prior to being ( pro tou ontos ) so that being itself  may succeed in being one ( auto tou hen einai ); but I mean not that  One which we say is “beyond being” ( epekeina tou ontos ) but this  43. His discussion of the second hypothesis is the briefest of the three.  Nikulin ( 2002 :74–80) lists it among his four hypotheses but omits it from his  discussion. Charles-Saget ( 1980 :43) spends a paragraph on it. 44. Charles-Saget ( 1980 :43) does not give speciﬁ  c references to Aristotle.  The subject pervades his works. A few most essential references are A. Pr .90a11; De An .406a18;Metaph .1003a30,1015b29–35. 45. VI.6.5.26–27:tÚ går sumbebhkÚw de› ti e‰nai prÚ toË  sumbebhk°nai.  Cf. VI. 6.10.28–39. 46.

(VI. 6.5.35–38) The passage brings to fruition Plotinus’ protracted labor on the subject.  Substantial number is superior to being because it determines being as one. The immediate clariﬁ  cation in the passage, that is, that he does not mean the  One beyond being, is not absolutely necessary since the beyondness of the One is not threatened here. The mention of the One beyond being is useful, though, because it clariﬁ  es that Number, prior to being, is the monad that  is predicated of each form. 49 A decad should not be perceived as composed  of ten separate units but, like a house, as a single unity that has ten powers brought together in one. The absolute unity of ten ( autodekas ) must preexist  the Forms, 50 as absolute justice preexists just acts. The absolute decad is to  the Forms as the Forms are to sense-perceptible objects. The major question, then, is that, if the one itself and the decad itself  exist in the intelligible prior to applying to the Forms, what is their abso- lute nature? Plotinus’ answer is that “we make [intelligible beings] come into being in thought.”  51 To illustrate his point, he quotes Aristotle’s De Anima, that “in immaterial things the knowledge and the thing are the same.” 52 For  Aristotle, the deﬁ  nition of “what it is” is the same as “what it is.” 53 In other  words, absolute Justice and the concept of justice are the same. For Plotinus, however, the deﬁ  nition or the concept of something does not constitute the  thing itself (VI. 6.6.19–26), 54 but the thing itself is nothing else but intel- lect and knowledge (VI. 6.6.26–29). Once again, Plotinus comes back to the  major point of disagreement with Aristotle on the number of inﬁ  nity, that  the Forms are absolute beings in the intelligible realm and have separate  existence both from their material copies and from dianoetic thought: true knowledge is not an image of the thing but the thing itself. 55 The absolute  nature of substantial number is in Intellect. 49.

The investigation has made a full circle starting  from the relationship between the Indeﬁ  nite Dyad and number in the intel- ligible and returning to the unity of knowledge and being in Intellect. From our vantage point, it seems that Plotinus should have addressed this question immediately after his discussion of the Indeﬁ  nite Dyad, because the question of how number is Intellect was pressing when he made the equation between  Intellect and multiplicity in V. 3.11 and III. 8.8. 56 Yet, he could not explicate  the relationship between number and Intellect without ﬁ  rst determining that  number precedes the Forms. Plotinus ﬁ  nds the ﬁ  nal proof that number precedes the Forms in the  nature of Intellect, in which knowledge of the Forms and Forms themselves  are in inseparable unity.57 A b s o l u t e  m o t i o n  ( autokinêsis ) of Intellect brings  the thoughts of the Forms ( noêsis ) not as “an image of the Forms but as the  Forms themselves” (VI. 6.6.31–34) because motion in Intellect is not inciden- tal but real and “the active actuality ( energeia ) of what is moved, which exists  in actuality.” 58 The unity of knowledge and Form suggests once again that  the absolute number ( arithmos auto ), as Plotinus later deﬁ  nes it in VI. 6.8, precedes the Forms and thus supports the anterior hypothesis (H 3). The Whole Number of Beings The one-in-many nature of Intellect invites Plotinus to search next for the unity of substantial number in the second hypostasis in VI. 6.7–8. 59 As I  discussed earlier, Intellect contemplates the One by cognizing its own multiplicity. 60 Thus, Intellect, as Gerson formulates it, “is the eternal prod- uct of the One” and “is cognitively identical with all intelligibles.” 61 In VI. 6.7, 56. Discussed pp. 35–36 and p. 104 . 57. The unity is “an intellectual statue, as if standing out from itself and  manifesting in itself, or rather existing in itself” (VI. 6.6.40–42). This is a triple  reference to Socrates’ comparison of the wholeness of the perfect state to the  overall completeness of a statue in R.420c–d, to Socrates’ request to view the  intelligible idea of the perfect state coming alive in Ti.19b–c, and to Aristotle’s  popular example of a bronze statue in Metaph .984a24–25,1013a25, and Ph .190a26, 207a28, among many others. 58.

Gerson ( 1994 :46).</p></div><div id="pagenum"><p>PLOTINUS ON NUMBER 82</p></div><p id="page">Plotinus repetitively describes this unity of Intellect and intelligibles as “one  nature” ( mia physis ),62 ﬁ rst by quoting Anaxagoras’ famous expression “all  in one together” ( homou en heni panta ), and second, by rephrasing it onto- logically as “all beings together” ( homou pantôn ontôn ).63 His paraphrase,  however, underlines the presence of multiplicity in Intellect.64 The appar- ent reason is that Intellect, as one nature, contains all intelligible beings as thinking contains all thoughts of Intellect. 65 Thus Intellect and beings share  the same intelligible nature. Closely echoing Anaxagoras, Plotinus explains in IV. 1.5–8 that “the whole Intellect one together” ( homou men nous pas ) is always inseparable and indivisible ( aei adiakritos kai ou meristos ). 66 Since  substantial number is Intellect, as explained in V. 1.5.12–14,67 then substantial  number must be also inseparable and indivisible from being.68 So what is the content of the “one nature” of Intellect? In the earlier dis- cussion of V. 3.11, we found the ﬁ  rst separation of multiplicity from the One  in the contemplative act of Intellect, in which Intellect sees and knows the  One by seeing and knowing itself as many ( nous polys and plêthynomenos ).69 Intellect, as self-reﬂ  exive thinking, knows itself as the external activity of the  One by seeing the multiplicity of beings. Copying the internal and external activities of the One, Intellect, as thinking, turns itself internally to contem-plate itself and, in the same act, turns externally to cognize its multiplicity (VI.6.7.8–10). So both Intellect and the beings it contemplates share “the one  nature” of the second hypostasis. 70 The explanation of the one nature of Intellect in VI. 6.7 elucidates the  bidirectional structure of multiplicity in the intelligible realm, which was  62. “One nature” is mentioned emphatically twice in VI. 6.7.1–2. 63. VI.6.7.4 and 7 ; Cf. D–K 59 B1. 64. Explaining the one nature of Intellect, Plotinus masterfully refers to  Anaxagoras’ quote three times without repeating himself—a good illustration of  Corrigan’s ( 2005 :4) assessment that “Plotinus never says exactly the same thing  twice.” 65.

The context of this statement is the participation of the unembodied  soul in the intelligible realm and the divisibility of its nature, which allows embodiment. 67. See pp. 68–70. 68. The conclusion complements Gerson’s distinction ( 1994 :178–179) between discursive divided intellect and undivided Intellect, which makes discursive thinking possible. Substantial number falls in with the latter. 69. See p. 35. 70.

The outward direction represents Intellect thinking all  beings, which are already separated in Intellect forever (VI. 6.7.10), whereas  the inward direction constitutes Intellect knowing all beings together in one.  The desire of multiplicity, after its separation from the One, to return to the  One (VI. 6.1.16), in fact, begins with the ﬁ  rst act of separation from the One,  which is marked by Intellect’s contemplation of itself as many. As Intellect embraces the Forms as one nature (VI. 6.7), so is m ul ti p li ci ty cir cumscri bed  by one and retained into unity (VI. 6.1.24). In VI. 6.8, the multiplicity of Intellect introduces the concept of the  Complete Living Being ( to panteles zôion and autozôion ), which “encompasses  in itself all living beings and being one as large as all things.”  71 The Complete  Living Being contains the multiplicity of all beings in the intelligible.72 The  whole number of beings has been an undercurrent in Plotinus’ discussion of unity since VI. 6.4.4, because it expresses the idea that the number of all  beings is ﬁ  nite. The Complete Living Being encompasses the whole num- ber of all living beings ( arithmos sympas ), and therefore is the absolute living  being ( zôion prôtôs ). 73 The intermediary position of the whole number in the  following equation demonstrates that number uniﬁ  es the intelligible realm.74 Equation of the Number of the Complete Living All Living Beings = Whole Number = Complete Living Being    [of Living Beings]  ta panta zôia = sympas arithmos = to autozôion As Intellect embraces the Forms into the Complete Living Being, so  does the whole number of all beings embrace the multiplicity of all beings that exist individually. The embracing, however, is not external, as if from one thing to another, but internal and self-identifying for both Intellect and  71. Respectively VI. 6.7.16–19 and 8 .2. Cf. Plato’s universal living being ( to zôion ) in the Ti .30c–31b. Charles-Saget ( 1980 :47) interprets the one-in-many  nature of Intellect and the Complete Living Being as different aspects of the  intelligible. 72. Hadot ( 1957:118–119) concludes that Sph .248e supports Ti .39e in the  description of the plurality of being in VI. 6.8.

Later Plotinus deﬁ  nes “the whole number” ( sympas arithmos ) itself as  “encompassing number” ( periechôn arithmos ) in the discussion of the presence  of number in the intelligible realm in VI. 6.9.31; see the section on substantial </p><div id="pagenum"><p>number and the Complete Living Being in chapter 5 .</p></div><div id="pagenum"><p>PLOTINUS ON NUMBER 84</p></div><p id="page">the beings.75 The division between thinking and beings is artiﬁ  cial and is a  result of our discursive thought. In Intellect, the activity of thinking ( noêsis ) is simultaneous with its own objects ( ta onta ).76 Where does absolute existence, such as the absolute man ( autoanthrôpos ) o r  th e  a b s o l u t e  n um be r  ( arithmos auto ), come from, then?77 S tri p p e d  o f  th e   burden of predication, the absolute substance ( alêthinê ousia ), according to  Plotinus, is a power that comes from itself and is “the most living and intel- ligent of all”:78 If then one should take being ﬁ  rst, since it exists ﬁ  rst, then, intel- lect, and then the living being (for it is already established that this contains all things)—but intellect comes second, for it is the active actuality of substance ( energeia gar tês ousias ) ;  th e n  n u m b e r  w o u l d   not be on the level of the living being ( o u t ’  a n  k a t a  t o  z ô i o n  h o   arithmos eiê )—for even before it one and two existed—nor on the  level of intellect ( oute kata ton noun )—for substance was before it,  which was already one and many ( pro gar autou hê ousia hen ousa  kai polla ên ). (VI. 6.8.17–22) As Charles-Saget notes, the passage recapitulates the ﬁ  ndings that Plotinus  has made thus far in his examination: that Being comes ﬁ  rst in the separation  from the One, followed in due order by Intellect and the Complete Living Being. 79 This summary, however, does not explain the place of number in the  triad of Being-Intellect-Complete Living Being. Substantial number is not at the level of the Complete Living Being since the Forms already existed  individually, 80 nor is it at the level of Intellect, since Intellect is already sec- ond in respect to Being, which, in turn, is also one and many. This con- clusion dismisses once again the ﬁ  rst two hypotheses introduced earlier at  VI.6.5, that number is either posterior to or simultaneous with the Forms,  and conﬁ  rms the third hypothesis, that number precedes the Forms and is  at the level of Being. 75. In III. 9.1.1–14, Plotinus clariﬁ  es Plato’s statement that “Intellect sees the  Ideas existing in the real living creature” ( Ti.39e7–9) by explaining that “there  is nothing in the statement against both being one, but distinguished by thought,  though only in the sense that one is intelligible object, the other intelligent subject.” 76.

(VI. 6.9.1–5) 81 The idea of division ( merismos ) of being according to number adds an onto- logical layer to its primary mathematical meaning.82 The passage examines  the ontogenetic role of substantial number and suggests that this number  is above all intelligibles and among the Platonic primary kinds (being, rest,  motion, same, and other).83 VI.6.6.41–42 has already explained that the abso- lute existence of all intelligibles “stands out from itself and manifests in itself, or rather exists in i tself . ” Ho w does n umber relate to absol u te substance? Is it a result of our thought and cleverness, or does it exist in the intelligible realm? 84 In order to answer these questions, Plotinus goes back to H 3 and fur- ther subdivides it into two propositions: ﬁ  rst, if number exists by itself in the  intelligible, number must preexist the Forms;85 o r  s e c o n d ,  i f  n u m b e r  e x i s t s   by itself, it comes after the Forms. The latter he has already rejected in H 1. Here he points to the apparent paradox, that if being precedes number, then  how it is that being is one being and two beings are two beings. His reason-ing clariﬁ  es the second hypothesis in the Parmenides  by asserting that the  idea of number is already in us when we count one man and a second man  after him and a succession of other men one after the other. 86 So number  81.

But it was [already clear] how many there had to be.2.  The whole number, therefore, existed before the beings themselves.3. 87 But, if numbers were before beings, numbers are not beings.4.  Number, therefore, was in being, not as the number of being—for 5.  being was still one.But number was in being as the power of number which, having come 6.  to exist ( hê tou arithmou dynamis hypostasa ), divided being ( emerise  to on ) 88 and made it, so to speak, in labor to give birth to multiplicity  (hoion ôdinein epoiêsen auton to plêthos ). The conclusion that the power of number divides being further suggests that  number is a productive power that is either the substance of being ( hê ousia  autou ) or the activity of being ( hê  e ne r g e i a  h o  a ri t hm o s  e s t a i ).89 The former  associates it with the intelligible realm in general, the latter with Intellect.90 I discuss the conceptual ramiﬁ  cations of this deﬁ  nition in the following  chapter. Now it is important to note that “power” ( dynamis ) here signiﬁ  es  actuality and not potentiality as in Aristotle. Plotinus associates number  with substance and ontological productivity. The Indeﬁ  nite Dyad represents  the element of potentiality in the intelligible. His distinction between the Indeﬁ  nite Dyad and substantial number in V. 1.5 clearly suggests that the latter  acts differently from the former. 91 If the former is potentiality, then the dif- f e r e n t  a c t  o f  t h e  l a t t e r  m u s t  b e  a c t u a l i t y .92 In addition, Plotinus associates  dynamis  with productive power and actuality when he describes the produc- tive power of the One. As Armstrong notes, the meaning of dynamis  in rela- tion to the One connotes something that is “supremely active, not passive”;93 87. Nikulin ( 2002 :75) makes the following successful comparison: “If we  stage a thought experiment in which we create something, we have to know  precisely beforehand how many things are to be produced. In this way, number  has to precede things.” 88.Merismos and synthesis are the mathematical terms for division and  multiplication; Heron, Def.21.1.6; Proclus, In Euc . p. 5 ,5. 89. VI.6.9.27–28. 90.

Substantial number is the mold into which the Forms slip to exist. Thus, it is both substance and primary activity of being. At this point, Plotinus’ argument is both most anti-Aristotelian and  most Aristotelian. Fusing what Plato calls true numbers in the Republic with  the description of ousia  as “being” in Phdr. 247c6–8, 95 Plotinus equates num- ber with substance, power, and activity of being. It is perhaps ironic, from a Platonic point of view, that Plotinus’ solution offers the most Aristotelian defense of Plato’s view of number. On the one hand, the deﬁ  nition of number  as substance succinctly contains the characteristics of Aristotle’s deﬁ  nition  of primary substance, 96 that it is concrete ( tode ti ) and separable ( chôristos ).97 On the other hand, Plotinus completely adapts Plato’s true number ( alêthi- nos arithmos ) to ﬁ  t the ontological hierarchy of the intelligible realm. As a  principle of actuality, number imposes limit onto the Indeﬁ  nite Dyad, as  a principle of potentiality. By explaining that number is substance ( ousia ), power ( dynamis ), and actuality ( energeia ), Plotinus makes number the build- ing block of the intelligible, as presented in VI. 6.9.29–31.

It is remarkable that Plotinus embeds what could arguably be  considered the essence of the argument of the entire treatise in a rhetorical question. For him, it seems that there is nothing left to explain or to prove about the constitutive role of substantial number in the intelligible, except spelling out its terms and different aspects. Brisson and Pradeau rightfully compare the aspects of substantial num- ber that participate in the production of the intelligible in VI. 6.9 to the role  of the mathematicals in the creation of the sensible world in the Timaeus. 98 According to Plotinus, substantial number has its own infrastructure includ-ing four terms corresponding to the ontological nature of every element in  t h e  t e t r a d  o f  B e i n g - I n t e l l e c t - C o m p l e t e  L i v i n g  B e i n g — b e i n g s  t h a t  h e  d i s - cussed earlier in VI. 6.7–8. 99 E a c h  t e r m  e x p l i c a t e s  t h e  i n n e r m o s t  n a t u r e  o f   every component in the tetrad. At the level of Being, Number is “uniﬁ  ed  with Being” ( arithmos hênômenos ). In all beings, number has unfolded outward ( arithmos exelêligmenos ).  This centrifugal movement is ontogenic and ﬁ  guratively represents the out- ward direction of multiplicity, described in the ﬁ  rst chapter of the treatise.100 Substantial number then divides Being, which is uniﬁ  ed number, according  to the whole number of beings that is already predetermined. The Complete Living Being is “encompassing number” ( arithmos  periechôn ) that circumscribes “the number of beings which has unfolded”  (arithmos exelêligmenos ) from “the uniﬁ  e d  n u m b e r  o f  B e i n g ”  ( arithmos  hênômenos ). The deﬁ  tnition of the encompassing number clariﬁ  es Plotinus’  earlier statement that the Complete Living Being embraces all beings that already exist individually. 101 “The unfolded number” of all beings and the encompassing number of the  Complete Living Being involve motion away from the uniﬁ  ed number of Being.  In other words, the substantial number in beings and the Complete Living  Being separate from the uniﬁ  ed n um ber of Being just as m ul ti p lici ty separates  from the One.102 The deﬁ  nitions of substantial number reinforce the initial  deﬁ nition of multiplicity as separation from the One in VI. 6.1. The foundation  of existence, then, is motion, which is inherent in Intellect, deﬁ  ned by Plotinus  as “number moving in itself” ( nous de arithmos en heautôi kinoumenos ).103 98.

Substantial number is absolute number, which, together with Being,  divides substance to create all beings that come after Being in separation from the One. It is also the rational principle ( logos ), described in V. 1.5.13, which orders substance ( ousia ) and constitutes being ( to on ). 105 Substantial  n um b e r  p arti ci p a t es  i n  B e i n g  as  an  a c ti vi ty  ( energeia ) of Being and as such  it emanates its power of numbering to all beings. Uniﬁ  ed number unfolds  itself into all beings, makes the number of multiplicity ﬁ  nite, and abides in  Intellect’s constant motion:106 “ B u t  t h e  S u b s t a n t i a l  n u m b e r  i s  t h a t  c o n t e m - plated in the Forms ( ousiôdês ho men epitheôroumenos tois eidesi ) and sharing  in their generation ( syggennôn auta ) ,  a n d ,  p r i m a r i l y ,  t h e  n u m b e r  i n  B e i n g   and with Being and before the beings ( pr ô t ô s  de  ho  en  t ôi  ont i  k ai  me t a  t ou   ontos kai pro tôn ontôn )” (VI. 6.9.35–37). The passage synthesizes Plotinus’  P l a t o n i c  a n s w e r  t o  A r i s t o t l e ,  t o w a r d  w h i c h  h e  h a s  b e e n  m o v i n g  s i n c e  t h e  beginning of his examination of the three hypotheses in VI. 6.4. 107 The expla- nation that substantial number is contemplated in the Forms implies that number is metaphysically superior to all intelligible entities and underlies their existence. When substantial number is a power and active actuality of Being, it is present in Being as uniﬁ  ed number ( arithmos hênômenos ). As  such, substantial number is for all beings what the One is for Being. As the One is the principle of Being ( tôi onti to hen archê ) and the existence of  Being rests upon the One ( epi toutou estin on,  VI.6.9.39–40), so is substantial  number the source, root, and principle of beings. 108 S in ce n um be r is “ actu - ality of substance” ( energeia tês ousias ) ,  n u m b e r  m u s t  b e  a t  t h e  l e v e l  o f  t h e   Indeﬁ  nite Dyad and Being. As Being is “absolute substance” ( alêthinê ousia ) and number is active actuality of the absolute substance, so is absolute num-ber actuality of substance ( energeia tês ousias ). Plato alludes to the idea that the Forms are numbers without coining a  particular term for them. Following Plato’s lead and the contemporary dis-putes on the Platonic theories of number in the Old Academy, Aristotle refers  104. Nikulin ( 2002 :73–76). 105. Nikulin ( 2002 :70). 106.

Since he develops a  new philosophical system, he must adapt the Platonic and Neopythagorean concept of number to suit his system. Thus, he has to explain how number is at the origin of the intelligible realm en tout  and at every intelligible entity  separately. To accomplish this, he needs more than a loan of old terminology. He needs to invent a new term for the name of the intelligible number that will capture precisely the symbiotic relationship between intelligible number and substance. As a result, he coins the term “substantial number” ( ousiôdês  arithmos ) in VI. 6.9.34 to denote the paradigmatic kind of n umber abiding in  the intelligible. Plotinus’ conclusion that substantial number constitutes the intelligi- ble realm continues the traditional dispute on Platonic number between the Aristotelian and Platonic schools. Therefore, to articulate his position better, in VI. 6.10–11 he reviews the main points of the argument. The summary is  important for the structure of the treatise as it is the centerpiece that marks the end of the investigation of the three hypotheses of the nature of number in the intelligible, and the start of the descending exegesis, which will trace the newfound understanding of the ontological role of number consecutively in Being, Intellect, the Complete Living Being, and all beings. 110 The sum- mary not only recapitulates the original top-down approach in presenting Plotinus’ cosmology in VI. 6.1, but also explains its conceptual reasons. Since  substantial number is the pattern that constitutes intelligible existence from the uniﬁ  e d  n um b e r  o f  Be in g  t o  th e  e n co m p as s in g  n um b e r  o f  th e  Co m p l e t e   Living Being, the only conceptually sound way for representing the compo-sition of the universe is to follow the pattern of substantial number unfolding the universe from Being to beings. In this vein, the beginning of VI. 6.10 reexamines the deﬁ  nition of mul- tiplicity as separation from the One ( apostasis tou henos ) in consideration  of the relationship between Being and substantial number. That number is being standing in multiplicity 111 r e w r i t e s  t h e  o r i g i n a l  d e ﬁ  nition of mul- tiplicity to mean that number instantiates the existence of multiplicity. It supports, in Plotinian terms, the second hypothesis of the Parmenides : 112 as  number stands ﬁ  rm in being, so does being stand ﬁ  rm in number. The two  are ontologically equal and inseparable. 109. The term is especially characteristic of Xenocrates (fr . 99 .28,110.3, 111.2,112.6,115,260.11). It appears only once in Speusippus (fr . 35 .4). 110. Charles-Saget ( 1980 :58–59) recognizes two themes in the chapter:  lines 1–20 support the conclusions of chapter 8 that number preexists being;  lines 20–51 discuss number as a predicate to being. 111.

It is like unities ( henades ) “keeping a place for beings which are  going to be founded on them” ( hidrythêsomenois ).113 It is not incidental ( kata syntychian ), but inherent to beings ( kata prothesin )  s o  t h a t  n u m b e r  p r e e x - ists beings.114 Finally, it is the cause that determines how many the beings  are.115 If w e co nsi d er th e as pect o f su bstan tial n um ber a t th e l e v e l o f Bein g ,  i t  b e c o m e s  c l e a r  t h a t  t h e  o r i g i n  o f  h e n a d s  a s  u n i t i e s  o r  s k e t c h e s  o f  b e i n g s   derives from “the uniﬁ  ed number of Being”: Each [being] is one, if the one in them is many all together ( homou  polla ên to hen to ep’ autois ),[116] as the triad is one, and all the beings  are one, not like the one of the number one ( ouch hôs to hen to kata  tên monada ), but as the ten thousand or any other number is one  (hôs hen hê myrias ê allos tis arithmos ). (VI. 6.10.17–20) Without being yoked to a particular thing,117 the henads in beings represent  individually the inseparable unity of the uniﬁ  ed n umber in and wi th Being .  If the decad, for example, consists of ten units and each unit is one, Plotinus  argues, this one is common to the ten individual units. But, if this one is common to the ten individual units, why could it not be common to the unity of the decad itself? It is obvious that “there is one nature predicated of  many, which we said must exist in itself before being observed in many.”  118 The common nature of the henad ( henas ) is the inseparable ontological unity  imparted both on the single unit in the decad and on the decad per se. This inseparable unity is not incidental but an individualized ontological expres-sion of the uniﬁ  ed number of Being ( hênômenos arithmos ). The henads have  existence of themselves and are not a result of agglutination or combina-tion. This conclusion rejects Aristotle’s proposition in Metaph. 1083a that the  units in numbers are combinable. 119 113. VI.6.10.2–4, further explained at VI. 6.10.20–29. 114.

But, it is not possible for the ﬁ  rst unit to be coupled with that which is one  in the highest degree, since that which is one in the highest degree does not need to be predicated of any thing (VI. 6.11.18–19). Theref ore, he concludes,  there must be “a one which is nothing else but bare one ( to hen psylon ), iso- lated in its essential nature, before each individual one is spoken and thought” (VI.6.11.19–21). This bare one is different from the One and is the henad of  each being. The henad is the ontological matrix for each particular being so  that no being could exist without being predicated to number. 122 Otherwise,  it would become innumerate and irrational ( anarithmon kai alogon ),123 echo- ing Aristotle’s conclusion in Metaph. 1083a8 that the distinctions between  number and unit are nonsensical ( aloga ). The decisiveness of this conclusion  is perhaps surprising. Plotinus brings the ﬁ  niteness of the universe down to  the henads and their inseparable unity with beings. The henads, as images  of the uniﬁ  ed number of Being ( hênômenos arithmos ), limit beings. Plotinus, however, is not yet ready to articulate the fusion between sub- stance and number as clearly as it is later found in Syrianus: “And indeed, if one imagines unitary numbers ( monadikoi arithmoi ) as coming into being,  one will observe the Form that confers quality as coming later to shape the  quantity underlying it.”  124 For Syrianus, the monads are “merely the matter or substratum  of number, on which we have to impose, as form, the triad,  pentad, heptad, ennead, etc., that we carry in our souls.” 125 In Plotinus, the clear conceptual distinction between monads and henads  is at a formative stage. Nikulin remarks that Plotinus uses monads ( mon- ades) and henads ( henades ) “rather loosely and interchangeably” throughout  the Enneads.126 And yet, in the discussion of the unity of substantial num- ber in VI. 6.4–5, Plotinus seems to relate the monad to substantial  number  120.

In the most important part of the  argument, which leads to the deﬁ  nition of substantial number in VI. 6.9.33, Plotinus states that “they” call the Forms henads and numbers. With Dodds, I take “they” to refer to the Neopythagoreans. 130 The evidence of Plotinus’ use of monads and henads in VI. 6 is incon- c l u s i v e .

While coining a new  name for Plato’s ontological numbers, Plotinus calls the quantitative num-ber “monadic” after Aristotle’s term for mathematical number. 131 Perhaps  Plotinus chooses Aristotle’s monadic number over Moderatus’ henadic num-ber in order to emphasize that Aristotle understands correctly quantitative  number but misunderstands Plato’s true numbers. Plotinus’ inconsistent use of monads and henads is a symptom not so  much of his conceptual ambiguity as of the uncertain terminology of his  times. Moderatus, as we saw earlier, distinguished between monads and henads in his deﬁ  nition of number as between unities of numbers and  127. VI.6.4.4:oÂon pr«ton aÈtÚ e‰nai, §noÆsamen monãda . 128.

Reﬂ ecting the divergent Neopythagorean terminology, Plotinus, perhaps  unwittingly, slips from one into the other during his discussion because  his main goal is to show that the unity of number and being is inseparable regardless of its terminology. In fact, this slip attempts to unite the different views and prepares the ground for the elaboration of the theory of henads in the later Neoplatonists. 133 It has been argued that Iamblichus, with his  strong Neopythagorean bent, is the ﬁ  rst one who starts to work on a theory  of henads, which Proclus later completes with the elaborated doctrine that gods are henads, ontologically prior to Being and Intellect. 134 In the company of the stars of Neoplatonic numeric theology, Plotinus’  contribution to the development of the concept of the henad has been over-looked. His view of substantial numbers as henads, I argue, deserves more attention and credit. His merit is in planting the idea that the henads are molds for the Forms and in explaining the two kinds of number as an intelli-gible paradigm and its quantitative, that is, sense-perceptible, copy. Monadic number is a copy of substantial number because, by separating the beings individually, it imitates the ontogenic role of substantial number. The deﬁ  nitions of substantial and monadic number are the ﬁ  nal step of  Plotinus’ solution to Aristotle’s criticism of Plato’s complicated understand-ing of number. This solution is successful for Plotinus’ cosmology because it establishes a Platonically informed relationship between the two kinds—substantial number is the ontological supersedent and the intelligible para-digm of monadic number. It is turned inwardly toward itself; its existence is uniﬁ ed with Being and, in this sense, is an absolute number . Monadic num- ber is the quantitative representation of substantial number and is turned outwardly to enumerate physical reality. Plotinus engages Plato and Aristotle in an imaginary dialogue about  the nature of number. If we ask ourselves who the winner in this scholastic debate is, the fact that the central section of VI. 6 opens with criticism of  Aristotle and closes with a new interpretation of Plato speaks for itself. 132. See pp. 43–46. 133. As Dodds summarizes ( 1963 :257), “the doctrine of divine henads  is the most striking of the modiﬁ  cations introduced by later Neoplatonism  into the Plotinian world.” But even Syrianus, who lived almost a century after  Iamblichus, uses them interchangeably, In Metaph .139.1.20–25,183.1.24–25. 134.

The view that number is an activity of primary substance 4 with speciﬁ  c properties warrants an investigation of the  relationship between substantial number and the general properties of sub-stance, also known as Plato’s greatest kinds of being, rest, motion, same, and other. 5 In a strictly Platonic context, the properties of substantial number  act as agents of the primary kinds in the construction of the intelligible and  reveal the exact ontogenetic details of how multiplicity separates from the One. This chapter examines each of the aspects in an attempt to construe the architecture of the universe according to them. Substantial Number and the One The anterior hypothesis that substantial number precedes beings, presented in VI. 6.4, places number at the heart of ontogenesis. 6 L a t e r ,  i n  V I . 6.9, P l o t i n u s  h i g h l i g h t s  t h e  o n t o l o gi c a l  i m p o r t a n c e  o f  n u m b e r  b y  d e ﬁ  ning sub- stantial number as activity of substance ( energeia tês ousias ).

Since substantial number is  primary activity of substance ( energeia tês ousias ), it follows that substan- tial number is substance itself and must possess the primary properties of substance: being, rest, motion, sameness, and otherness. 9 The deﬁ  nition  o f  n u m b e r  a s  a  p r i m a r y  a c t i v i t y  o f  s u b s t a n c e ,  i n  f a c t ,  f u l ﬁ  lls the premise  of the third hypothesis that substantial number is prior to beings, has a separate existence from beings, and participates in the creation of beings. The ontogenetic power of substantial number “continually gives existence” by dividing Being, as “uniﬁ  ed number” ( hênômenos arithmos ), into mul- tiplicity of beings. 10 The idea that substantial number is primary activity  of substance itself implies that Being does not exist without being uniﬁ  ed  in and with substantial number. This understanding poses the question of whether substantial number per se can exist without the union with being. Certainly, the statement in VI. 6.10.2–3 that the henads are molds ( paraskeuê and protypôsis ) 11 for beings suggests this, if not at the level of Being, at least  at the level of beings. In our discussion of the relationship between the Indeﬁ  nite Dyad and  substantial number in chapter 2, we examined Plotinus’ argument in V . 1.5 t h a t  n u m b e r  i s  n o t  ﬁ  rst, but the One is prior to the Dyad; the One limits  the Dyad; and, when it does this, substantial number is already in place.12 In the argument, however, the logical transition from the One that limits the Indeﬁ  nite Dyad to the predetermined existence of substantial number is  abrupt. It is not clear what exactly predetermines the substantial numbers,  u n l e s s  w e  u n d e r s ta n d  th a t  th e  M o n a d ,  a s  a n  i m a g e  o f  th e  O n e ,  i s  i m p l i e d .  Yet Plotinus does not proceed to say that this kind of number is “as being” (hôs on ), but “as substance” ( hôs ousia ). This comparison is also ambiguous,  h o w e v e r .

V. 1.5 does not offer an answer but makes one thing clear: substantial number is different from the One. At the end of our analysis of V. 1.5, 13 we reached the  same conclusion, just on more general terms; namely, that the One is not  8. Gerson ( 1994 :23). 9. VI.6.9.27–29. 10.

How, then, is substantial number an ontological  expression of the One? As determined earlier , the view of substan tial n umber as po wer of sub- stance ( dynamis tês ousias ) depends on the understanding that the One,  although it does not divide itself into all, is the productive power of all ( dyna- mis tôn pantôn ).15 In its internal activity, the One remains unchanged because  it is simple, perfect, and self-sufﬁ  cient.16 In its external activity, the One is  omnipresent and the most powerful source of all life.17 T h i s  e x t e r n a l  p r o - ductive activity, however, entails the existence of another one that can par-ticipate in being. This other one is the substantial number that “continually gives existence” ( ousiôdês men ho to einai aei parechôn ). 18 Substantial number,  therefore, is the ontological expression of the One, because it executes in actuality the dividing and ordering of substance and induces existence. In V. 5.4–5, Plotinus analogically illustrates the difference between the  One and substantial number by distinguishing between substantial and monadic number. Monadic number, he says, gives quantity, both when it i s  i n  s e r i e s  w i t h  o t h e r  n u m b e r s  a n d  w h e n  i t  m e a s u r e s  t h i n g s . 19 This is the  ﬁ rst time mathematical number is mentioned in the Enneads  and it is not  introduced as monadic, but as quantitative number. Obviously, the primary goal of Plotinus’ analogy is to show that the One and substantial number do not participate in quantity, and thus do not have anything to do with quantitative number. He further explains that quantitative number imparts quantity by imitating the relationship between substantial number and the One. Monadic number does not expand or divide the unity of substantial number, but when “a dyad comes to be, the monad before the dyad exists, neither each of the two units in the dyad nor one of them is the monad in the dyad.”  20 Substantial number remains unchanged because it is not quantity  but a pattern or a holding place for being.21 Therefore it is not expandable  nor divisible, but only ontological. 14. VI.5.3.19–20: the One is one and the same, undivided by number. 15. Respectively, VI. 6.9.26 and III. 8.10.1, discussed in chapter 4. 16. Gerson ( 1994 :16–18). 17. I.8.2.4–7. 18. V.5.4.18. 19.

While ousia,  as intelligible substance, and hylê,  as  sense-perceptible matter, are to a large extent terminologically separated,23 the word “number” ( arithmos ) makes both substantial number ( ousiôdês  arithmos ) and monadic number ( monadikos arithmos ) appear only as its sub- genera. Therefore, it takes Plotinus a lot more explanation to elicit the differ- ences between the two. He often uses an analogy with One to illustrate the  difference between substantial and monadic number. In V. 5.4–5, for example,  he compares the relationship between the two kinds of number speciﬁ  cally  to the relationship between substantial number and the One. Compared to monadic number, substantial number is nondiscursive in the sense that it is nonquantitative. In regards to nondiscursiveness, substantial number is to monadic number what the One is to substantial number. 24 But he also expli- cates the nonnumerical nature of the One by deﬁ  ning and comparing the two kinds of number. Substantial number is closer to the One than any other intelligible being, including the Complete Living Being and Intellect, and yet is not the One, as “the One would not have made a discrete plurality.”  25 Plotinus uses the analogy of substantial number and the One to explain  the relationship between the two kinds of number. The analogy places sub- stantial number in the intermediate position between the One and monadic  number and thus metaphorically shortens the distance between the One, as the principle ( archê ) of all, and number which enumerates physical reality.  He again ﬁ  nds monadic number useful in the description of the absolute  One: Now we long to see, if it is in any way possible, what is the pure,  real One ( to katharôs hen), unrelated to anything else. At this point,  then, you must rush to one, and not any longer add anything to it,  but stand absolutely still in fear of departing from it ( stênai pan- telôs dediota autou apostatêsai ), and not progress the least little way  towards two. (V. 5.4.6–10) 22. VI.5.2.1–6. O’Meara ( 1993:24–26) deservedly calls it “a category  mistake” leading to the major difﬁ  culty in understanding the intelligible per se. 23.

Nikulin cites the same lines to  illustrate the closest proximity of the Monad to the One.27 The passage is  most interesting, however , in that it uses quantitative concepts to convey the nonquantitative and absolute nature of both the One and the Monad: T o rush to the One;1.  Not to add anything to the One;2.  To stand absolutely still in fear of departing from the One;3.  Not to progress even a little toward two.4.  The series of negations establishes the One and the Monad as not countable and beyond monadic number. If we reverse the above negative propositions and replace the One with “one” in the sense of unit, we can construe the deﬁ nitions of number and multiplicity proper: 28 T o move away from one;1.  To add something to one;2.  T o separate from one;3.  T o progress toward two.4.  The two lists of propositions emphasize the polarity between the One and the mathematical one and prove that the One is beyond number. As stated in V. 5.4.12–15, the One is “not included in the count with another one, or  another number of any size; it will not be counted at all: for it is a measure and not measured, and it is not equal to the other units so as to be one of their company.” This conclusion, although intended to distinguish the One from monadic number, also highlights the differences between substantial and monadic number itself. Substantial number, as an expression of the One, is a measure for being as it “continually gives existence,” while, in itself, it is unmeasured, because it is nonquantitative but ontological. 29 Since quantita- tive number imitates substantial number as its ontological paradigm, so does substantial number, 30 in turn, imitate its own supersedent, the One, which is  the measure of all and itself unmeasured.31 26.

As the henads are molds for beings  to be limited and shaped,33 so does the uniﬁ  ed number limit and shape  Being. This means that number has priority even over Being and if number i s  p ri o r  t o  Be in g ,  th e n  th e  uniﬁ  ed substantial number is the closest to the  source of all. At the level of Being, substantial number is uniﬁ  ed with Being, forming  the archetype of all beings. Nevertheless, this archetype should not be con-fused with the Monad. The Monad is the very ﬁ  rst to come from the pro- ductive power of the One and, together with the Indeﬁ  nite Dyad, generates  every number as a form or a henad. 34 As such, the Monad represents abso- lute stability and unity with itself. In V. 5.5, Plotinus analogically elucidates  that “as there in the case of numbers, the form of the ﬁ  rst, the monad, was  in all numbers primarily and secondarily, and each of the numbers which come after the monad did not participate in it equally, so here too each of the beings which come after the First has in itself a kind of form of it.” 35 Substantial numbers and beings participate only to a different degree in the absoluteness of the Monad. The Monad, as an image of the One, and the Indeﬁ  nite Dyad give substantial existence to being so that being is a trace,  albeit imperfect, of the One. 36 The Monad, as the generating principle of  existence, is not a substantial number, however. Plotinus emphasizes the dif-ference between the ﬁ  rst Monad and the absolute Being, by deﬁ  ning Being  as uniﬁ  ed number, not as uniﬁ  ed monad. 37 The meaning of the term uniﬁ  ed number ( hênômenos arithmos ) denotes  limit and rest. Both of them are permanent characteristics of existence and  relate to the One as their source. To illustrate the absoluteness of the One, Plotinus recalls Plato’s explanation of the First Hypothesis in the  Parmenides, 32. V.3.7.25–26:¶stin ı m¢n noËw §n aÍt“ §n°rgeia . 33. VI.6.10, discussed in chapter 4. 34. Opposite to Aristotle ( Metaph. 1084b5–6), who considers the henads  as matter of number. As Nikulin ( 2002 :82) summarizes, “the matter of the  essential number is rather a multiplicity of the dyad, bounded by the form of the  monad.” 35. V.5.5.7–11. 36. V.5.5.11–14. 37. Syrianus ( In Metaph. 112 .31) explicitly distinguishes between the Monad </p><div id="pagenum"><p>and the Dyad as ontogenetic principles and the substantial monad and dyad.</p></div><div id="pagenum"><p>NUMBER AND THE UNIVERSE 101</p></div><p id="page">that “the one does not move, nor does it stand still.” 38 The One, as the ﬁ  rst  principle of all, is both “the power which causes motion and rest” and “beyond  motion and rest.”39 Since the One is simple and ﬁ  rst, it is not itself in motion  and rest, but produces them in its external activity.40 As a result, motion and  number are among the primary properties of substance. Consequently, in the ontological procession from the One, Being denotes rest, while Intellect denotes motion. When the external productive activity of the One comes into being, it turns back to the One, ﬁ  lls itself with multiplicity, and becomes  Intellect by contemplating the One. This stopping and introverted turning, Plotinus explains, is being, whereas the retrospective gaze upon the One is Intellect. 41 I n  o t h e r  w o r d s ,  B e i n g ,  a s  u n i ﬁ  ed number, is Intellect’s rest in  relation to the One.42 Thinking stops in Being. Plotinus, therefore, deﬁ  nes  the primary kind of stability ( stasis ) as the limit of Intellect.43 In V. 1.7, Plotinus refers to being ( to on ) as not ﬂ  uctuating-in-the-indeﬁ  nite  and as ﬁ  xed by limit and stability. This description is based on the role of substantial number in the relationship between the One and the Indeﬁ  nite  Dyad. Since the Indeﬁ  nite Dyad is the principle of potentiality, which, unde- ﬁ n e d ,  i s  in  co n s tan t  m o ti o n ,  th e  On e ,  as  th e  s o ur ce  o f  s ta b ili ty ,  d e ﬁ  nes the  indeﬁ  niteness of the Dyad with limit and shape through substantial number.  As a result, substance is characterized as that which is already deﬁ  ned by  number, while limit and shape in substance instantiate being and produce stability in the intelligible realm. 44 If we compare the deﬁ  nition of being as stability of existence by limit  and shape, to the deﬁ  nition of substantial number in V . 5.4, as number that  “continually gives existence,” we can deduce that substantial number, as an ontological expression of the One, is the source of limit and shape for being. As quantitative number measures generation in physical reality , so does sub-stantial number deﬁ  ne, albeit nonquantitatively and non-sense-perceptibly,  the generation of being in the intelligible. 38.Prm. 139b.2–3:tÚ ©n êra, …w ¶oiken, oÎte ßsthken oÎte kine›tai .

In VI. 6.9.29, the deﬁ  nition of Being as uniﬁ  ed substantial number sug- gests that Being and substantial number are at rest ( stasis ). As uniﬁ  ed sub- stantial number, Being is an image of the One as the source of stasis.  Because  stasis  itself signiﬁ  es stability and thus existence, Plotinus almost hints that  the primary kind of stasis  has precedence over the primary kind of motion  (kinêsis ), al th o u g h h e in tr od u ces th e la tt e r ﬁ  rst in his discussion of the pri- mary kinds. He admits that, if someone does not consider stasis  among the  p r i m a r y  k i n d s ,  h e  i s  c o m p l e t e l y  o u t  o f  l i n e  ( atopôteros ):49 ﬁ rst, because rest  is easier to relate to being than movement, and second, because rest simply  means “existing in the same state and in the same way.” 50 Although existence  is separation from the One and thus denotes movement, being is ﬁ  rst asso- ciated with limit and consequently rest. The lack of movement implies per- manency and stability. The uniﬁ  ed substantial number simply deﬁ  nes Being  as stasis. In the beginning of VI. 6.10, Plotinus summarizes that Being “stands  ﬁ rm in multiplicity, when it woke as many, and was a kind of preparation for  the beings and a preliminary sketch.” 51 We have already discussed this pas- sage in relation to the henads.52 The true context of the passage, however, is  the unity of one and many in Being. The henads represent the multiplicity  of beings that retain a trace of the uniﬁ  ed number of Being in themselves to  impart onto their beings. Thus, each henad, as a holding place for being, is an individual version of the uniﬁ  ed number of Being. The uniﬁ  ed number of Being and stasis  are ontological representations  of the perfect unity of the One. Since “Being came into existence from the One” and the One is absolute by nature, then, in number, Being inherits the unity of the One ( to hen ) as uniﬁ  ed number ( hênômenos arithmos ). 53 That  45.

Substantial Number and Intellect In the Timaeus,  the Demiurge orders the motion of the primeval elements  into a ﬁ  nite universe, revolving according to number. In the Sophist,  Plato  considers movement one of the primary kinds. With the concept of the Unmoved Mover, Aristotle places motion in the foundation of the universe. Moderatus sees motion in the progression and regression of number to and from one. 56 Numenius’ First God possesses both rest and innate motion.57 Plotinus makes movement the basis of all life in the intelligible.58 For him,  the source of movement is the One itself.59 Movement both underlies the  separation of multiplicity from the One and deﬁ  nes the relationship between  the Indeﬁ  nite Dyad and the Monad in the production of the Forms and numbers. Plotinus’ deﬁ  nition that Intellect is substantial number “which moves in  itself”  60 reﬂ ects upon the many facets of the concept in its long tradition and  lays the foundation of the second hypostasis. In its nature, intelligible move-ment is atemporal and aspatial, for it is only a logical sequence articulating the ontological succession and dependence among beings. As an ontological expression of the One, 61 substantial number is also an expression of intelligi- ble movement since the One is the source of both rest and movement.62 In our earlier discussion of the relationship between the Indeﬁ  nite Dyad  and substantial number, we established that Plotinus considers number and  54.

The One beyond Being is not predicated to anything and the one in  the one-being exists only as one in Being because, there, it is not divided into  parts (VI. 2.9).

In III. 8–9, while elaborating on the theory of contemplation,  Plotinus explains that number belongs to the intelligible realm since Intellect is number. 65 When Intellect contemplates the One, it does not contemplate  it as the simple one, but it unknowingly becomes many: “as if heavy [with drunken sleep], it unfolded itself because it wanted to possess everything.”  66 I leave the discussion of the unfolded aspect of Intellect for the next sec-tion. Here let us focus on Intellect’s desire to possess everything. If Intellect desires to possess everything, it follows that Intellect is deﬁ  cient in some  way and that thinking expresses Intellect’s deﬁ  ciency. 67 T h e  n a t u r e  o f  t h i s   deﬁ ciency derives from the complexity caused by the one-in-many nature  of Intellect.68 Since Intellect is not simple as the One is, Intellect is not self- sufﬁ cient as the One is. By thinking itself, Intellect comprehends all intel- ligibles in itself, in order to replenish its deﬁ  ciency. The desire for fulﬁ  llment  originates the introverted motion of Intellect, which results in the uniﬁ  ed  number of Being. Th e co n ce p t tha t In t e ll ect is n um be r m o vin g in i tse lf also po rtra ys th e  self -con tained nature o f In tellect. As p re vi o usl y discussed,69 Intellect knows  and sees itself by contemplating the One.70 This self-knowledge is introspec- tive. By turning inward, Intellect realizes its multiplicity, but, in doing so, Intellect still retains its self-directed orientation. 71 As Plotinus describes it,  “the Being of Intellect is activity, and there is nothing to which the activity is directed; so it is self-turned.”  72 The self-turned activity represents the  moving-in-itself number that allows Intellect to be self-contained.73 63.

Plotinus points  at its prominent position among the other primary kinds by introducing ousia and kinêsis  as the ﬁ  rst two primary kinds. In this order, kinêsis  is mentioned  even before stasis,  as if rest can occur only after motion occurs. As we deter- m i n e d  a b o v e ,  m o t i o n  i s  i n  t h e  f o u n d a t i o n  o f  t h i n k i n g  a n d  t h u s  e x i s t e n c e .74 Without the motion of thinking, Intellect cannot realize itself, and the exis- tence of Being, in its state of rest as uniﬁ  ed number, would be impossible. The primary kind of movement is an activity of being that is ontologically  inseparable from being, except in our dianoetic thought. Movement does not change the nature of being, “but rather is in being as if making it perfect. ”  75 Intellect’s number, which moves in itself, then perfects Intellect’s deﬁ  cient  nature that desires to possess everything. Intellect’s thinking is centripetal,  internalized motion that results in both Intellect’s separation from the One  and Intellect’s realization that it is separated from the One. Intellect becomes Intellect through the contemplation of its separation from the One: Thinking, which sees the intelligible and turns towards it and is, in a way, being perfected by it, is itself indeﬁ  nite like seeing ( aoristos men  autê hôsper opsis ), but is deﬁ  ned by the intelligible ( horizomenê de  hypo tou noêtou ). This is why it is said: from the Indeﬁ  nite Dyad and  the One derive the Forms and Numbers ( ek tês aoristou dyados kai  tou henos ta eidê kai hoi arithmoi ): that is Intellect ( touto gar ho nous ). For this reason Intellect is not simple but many ( dio ouch haplous,  alla polla ); it manifests a composition, of course an intelligible one,  and already sees many things. It is, certainly, also itself an intelligible, but it thinks as well: so it is already two ( dio dyo êdê ). (V . 4.2.4–11) By thinking, Intellect is Intellect, that is, many, intelligible, intelligent, in motion, and everything else appropriate to it. 76 Thus Intellect is a movement,  for “one must include movement if there is thought, and rest that it may think the same” (V. 1.4.36–37). 77 Both the One and Intellect are thinking, but,  74. In VI. 2.7.16–20, Plotinus states that motion is not under nor over, but  with being, as, in VI. 6.9, he determines that number is with and in substance. 75.

An idea already alluded to in VI. 6.6.30–33: “So the thought of  movement has not made absolute movement, but absolute movement has made </p><div id="pagenum"><p>the thought of it, so that it has made itself as movement and thought; for movement there is also the thought of that thing itself.”</p></div><div id="pagenum"><p>PLOTINUS ON NUMBER 106</p></div><p id="page">while the One itself is thinking of itself, Intellect is thinking of itself as well  as contemplating that from which it comes (V. 4.2.13–26).78 In the intelligible, motion is thinking. The churning motion of number  in Intellect is the waking power in VI. 6.10.1–2, which substantiates Intellect  itself, and divides being “in labor to give birth to multiplicity.” 79 Intellect is  shaped by substantial number.80 There is nothing unmeasured ( ametron ) in Intellect, for it moves itself according to substantial number, which is an ontological expression of the One. 81 N u m b e r  o n t o l o g i c a l l y ,  n o t  q u a n t i - tatively, measures the separation of being from the One. In Being, motion has stopped in the uniﬁ  ed substantial number. The beginning of the internal  motion of number in Intellect is thinking, which makes its ﬁ  rst stop at the uniﬁ ed number of Being, unfolds into the ministops of beings, and contains  itself in the Complete Living Being. Substantial Number and Beings Plotinus’ understanding that Intellect is number moving in itself can be rep-resented dynamically by a circle which, possessing all beings, unfolds itself. 82 This understanding of Intellect predetermines the deﬁ  nition of beings as  substantial number that has been unfolded.83 The unfolded number of beings  is the result of the unfolding thought of Intellect itself: But immediately after Intellect comes being, and number is in this, an d wi th i ts h e l p i t p rod u ces th e real bein gs w h en m o vin g acco r d-ing to number ( meth’ hou ta onta gennai kinoumenon kat’ arithmon ), setting the numbers before their existence ( prostêsamenon tous arith- mous tês hypostaseôs autôn ) as the One stands before its own, joining  being itself to the ﬁ  rst. (VI. 6.15.24–27) The passage describes the productive power of the One “in labor to give birth to multiplicity.”  84 As explained, being cannot “by its own means become  78. The textual problems of the text are discussed in Merlan ( 1964 :45–47).  Armstrong ( 1984 : vol. 5 ,146) points out that this passage clearly articulates the  idea that the One thinks. 79.

As it thinks itself, Intellect thinks beings into  existence.86 In regard to the primary kinds, beings are a particular being, a  particular rest, and a particular motion. These particular properties bring together in themselves the different aspects of the substantial number under-lying the corresponding primary kinds. The results of this conﬂ  ation are  the henads of the Forms. Each henad expresses a particular unity of the particular kinds. Beings express most clearly the primary kind of otherness. The difference between the beings ( diestêsen en heterotêti ) produces discrete  multiplicity ( diestêkos plêthos ). 87 The general properties of substance are recognized by separating them  from one another according to their difference.88 W e  e x a m i n e d  t h e  d i f f e r - ences among Being, Intellect, and beings as represented by the different aspects of substantial number. If we consider the primary kinds in relation to the different aspects of substantial number, it becomes apparent that Plotinus connects the differences among the primary kinds to the different aspects of substantial number. The primary kind of otherness underlies the unfolded number of beings. As each of them has a particular being, a particular rest, and a particular motion, then each being possesses a particular ontological identity that characterizes the differences in beings.

Each being, on the other hand, is not passively contained  by Intellect as a part in Intellect. As Corrigan puts it, “each part is not only in the whole but is  th e w ho l e, so to speak, j ust b y bein g i tse lf . ”  89 This  “all-in-one” ( homou en heni panta ) Intellect is the Complete Living Being.90 The totality of the uniﬁ  ed number of Being is matched by the whole num- ber of the Complete Living Being. If Intellect were only sameness, it could not think itself because it could not relate itself to something different from itself. 91 When Being thinks, it relates Intellect to itself as an otherness to the  One. Since Intellect is not self-sufﬁ  cient, it thinks both itself and the beings  inside itself and, by this, possesses both otherness and sameness.92 It may seem that Plotinus should have had the uniﬁ  ed number of Being  represent the primary kind of sameness ( tautotês ).93 He does not, however,  deﬁ ne sameness as noncompositeness or simplicity. On the contrary, he  introduces the primary kind of sameness, as “bringing beings back together to unity” and “seeing beings as unity.”  94 In other words, the general prop- e r t y  o f  s a m e n e s s  c a n  b e  r e c o g n i z e d  o n l y  a f t e r  b e i n g s  h a v e  b e e n  p e r c e i v e d   as different. Sameness comes to exist as a mirror reﬂ  ection of otherness.  Plotinus describes the bringing of beings together as “collecting them into  sameness.” 95 His deﬁ  nition of the primary kind of sameness does not imply  an ontological stop, as in the uniﬁ  ed number of Being, but an all-inclusive  revolving ontological motion. Intellect “moves along in the same way and on  one same and identical course, but still is not the same one partial thing,  but all things.” 96 Therefore, “there is otherness and sameness where there is  Intellect and Substance” (VI. 7.39.4–5). It turns out that the assertion Plotinus made in the beginning of VI. 6 that multiplicity is limited contains ontological truth. E very aspect of multi-plicity corresponds to a certain role of number in the intelligible: that “mul-tiplicity is separation from the One” ( apostasis tou henos,  VI.6.1.1) represents  the moving number of Intellect ( n o u s  d e  a r i t h m o s  e n  h e a u t ô i  k i n o u m e n o s , VI.6.9.30–31), and the outward and inward directions of multiplicity exhibit  89.

Number, then, is the rational principle that orders the intelligi- ble realm.98 The absolute uniﬁ  ed number in Being, when contemplated by  Intellect (the number moving in itself), divides substance and becomes the unf o l d e d  n um be r  o f  be in gs ,  e n c l os e d  b y  th e  ﬁ  nite number of the Complete  Living Being. 99 The examination of the properties of substantial number reveals that  they represent, in a concentrated form, the primary kinds of substance. I say concentrated because all primary kinds determine the existence of every being and, as Plotinus says, the primary kinds appear to us at ﬁ  rst as mixed  and indistinguishable. It is only after our dianoetic examination that we per-ceive them individually. 100 From this it follows that the different properties of  substantial number simultaneously underlie the structure of the intelligible, an d  o nl y  w h e n  w e  e xamin e  th e m  in di vi d uall y  d o  th e y  a p p ear  in  th e ir  m os t  concentrated form in each of the elements in the second hypostasis. The particular activities of substantial number in Being, Intellect, beings,  and the Complete Living Being, as deﬁ  ned in VI. 6.9, correspond to Plato’s  ﬁ ve primary kinds: the uniﬁ  ed number of Being ( hênômenos arithmos ) corre- sponds to stability ( stasis ); the number moving in itself in Intellect ( arithmos  en heautôi kinoumenos ) corresponds to motion ( kinêsis ); the unfolded number in beings ( arithmos exelêligmenos ) corresponds to otherness ( heterotês ); and  the encompassing number in the Complete Living Being ( arithmos periechôn ) corresponds to sameness ( tautotês ). Each activity, just like each category,  characterizes a different aspect of the intelligible realm. When put together, all activities of substantial number bring together the different aspects of the same whole. 101 This same whole, in turn, corresponds to the ﬁ  fth primary  k i n d  o f  b e i n g .

Substantial number has priority over all aspects of the intelligible, including Being.

Number substantiates separation from the One,  which enables Being to stand ﬁ  rm in multiplicity.102 In his own summary,  “the ﬁ  rst and true number is the principle and spring of existence for the  real beings.” 103 Considering Plotinus’ principal disagreement with Aristotle’s categories,104 the correlation between the Platonic primary kinds and the properties of sub- stantial number in Plotinus provides another conceptual defense of Platonic  number. He uses the parallel to argue once again for the existence of sub-stantial number against Aristotle’s mathematical interpretation, discussed  earlier. 105 Aristotle places quantity second on the list of his ten categories, follow- ing substance itself.106 Most often, he refers to it as poson  and occasionally as  posotês ,107 but never as number ( arithmos ). This fact is important because it  proves that Aristotle views quantity to be the primary genus, of which num-ber is simply a species. Consequently, this view leads to the fundamental rift between Aristotle and Plotinus on the subject of number. In VI. 1.4 and  VI.2.13, Plotinus argues against Aristotle’s placement of quantity among what  Plotinus considers to be the primary kinds. 108 According to Plotinus, quantity  is posterior both to the primary kinds (being, rest, motion, otherness, and sameness) and to itself. 109 Further, Aristotle divides quantity into two species: discrete ( diaireton ) and continuous ( syneches ).110 Among the former he places number, because  the units in arithmetical number do not have a common boundary; among the latter, he places magnitude, for example, a line, because all the points on a line are in relation to one another and have a common boundary. 111 102.

Plotinus views Aristotle’s categories entirely from the point of Plato’s  primary kinds and consequently ﬁ  nds them completely inapplicable for the  understanding of being in VI. 1.1–24.

For how would they both relate to one common quantity, unless the quantity in the continuous is considered to be incidental? But if the continuous things are quantity only incidentally, that does not explain what their nature is “in virtue of which they are considered quantity.”  116 In order for quantity to be a  primary kind, it must be simultaneous with being, like Plato’s primary kinds described above. 117 Plotinus argues that quantity is posterior to these pri- mary kinds, because it includes movement when number increases and rest when number stops to make a unit. 118 Quantity is a mixture of movement  and rest, and thus composite and not inherent to substance. Quantity is only a form. 119 He speciﬁ  es that, in order to understand the nature of number as  a Platonist, one should investigate how numbers in and by themselves are substances. No matter what the substantial nature of number is, in any case, such numbers have nothing in common with quantitative numbers except the name alone. 120 The primary kinds of being, motion, rest, otherness, and sameness  conﬂ ate into the concept of substantial number. By considering substantial  number as activity of substance ( energeia tês ousias ), Plotinus relates number  to the essence of substance itself and to Aristotle’s primary substance that explains what a thing is. Thus substantial number, like being, is a whole in  112. Apostle ( 1980 :71) notes that the name “discrete,” although the  antonym of “continuous,” is not a synonym of “noncontinuous.” 113.

It exists independently in the intelligible, and yet the things  participate in it.121 Soul and Number Plotinus’ omission of soul from the list of the activities of substantial num-ber is rather conspicuous by now. This notion is sharpened by the long pre-Plotinian tradition of understanding soul as number, including the Pythagoreans, Plato’s Demiurge, who uses arithmetical ratios and geometrical patterns to make the cosmic soul, and Xenocrates’ concept of the soul as self-moving number. 122 Before Plotinus, Soul is one element of the intelligible that has  been clearly associated with number. Yet he does not discuss the soul until the end of the exegesis on the concept of number, in VI. 6.16. Furthermore,  on the list in VI. 6.9, he does not assign a speciﬁ  c activity of substantial num- ber to Soul. He does not even mention Soul in the discussion of substantial  number in the intelligible in VI. 6.6–10. The ﬁ  rst time he introduces soul in  the treatise is through Plato’s explanation that the notion of number arises in  th e trans i ti o n o f so ul as i t goes fr o m o n e thin g t o an o th e r , as if i t n um be rs them. 123 This is also the last time Plotinus refers to soul until the antepenul- timate chapter of the treatise. Why is soul missing from the central and most  essential chapters dealing with the concept of number in VI. 6? The reason for this, I argue, lies in the concept of substantial number  itself. In V. 3.5 and III. 8.9, Plotinus introduces Intellect as number. In the  central chapters of VI. 6, and especially in the list of activities of substantial  number in VI. 6.9, he elaborates every detail of number’ s construction of the  second hypostasis, and thereby conﬂ  ates the properties of substantial num- ber with the primary kinds of existence. This conﬂ  ation seals the ontogenetic  productive power of substantial number exclusively in the intelligible realm. At the level of Soul, as the third hypostasis, which mediates between the  intelligible and the sensible, things are more complicated. Substantial number  generates Being, Intellect, beings, and the Complete Living Being, because they are pure intelligible entities. Soul, however, contains the complex duality of having a part of itself undescended in the intelligible realm and a part of itself descended in the corporeal world. Substantial number therefore cannot ha v e an ex cl usi v e property wi th Soul, unless all o f Soul is undescended and d i s e m b o d i e d .

Here he  121. VI.2.12. 122. Ti.35–37; Xenocrates, fr. 190 .</p><div id="pagenum"><p>123. VI.6.4.9–18.</p></div><div id="pagenum"><p>NUMBER AND THE UNIVERSE 113</p></div><p id="page">examines the relationship between the two kinds from a new perspective. He  explains that substantial numbers, which are the ﬁ  rst numbers in the gener- ation of the intelligible realm, are “numbered numbers” ( prôtoi arithmoi, hôs  arithmêtoi ).124 They are numbered in the sense that they possess the number,  which they represent, inherently as their substance, and they do not measure or count things quantitatively. 125 The henads, deﬁ  ned as molds for beings in  VI.6.10.1–2, then represent the numbered numbers. Since substantial num- bers are numbered numbers and paradigms of monadic numbers, it follows that monadic numbers are “numbering numbers” that measure and count the countable things ( arithmountes tous arithmous kai ta arithmêta ). 126 This  conceptual and etymological play, however, is perplexing.127 Plotinus admits  that his audience ﬁ  nds this distinction most difﬁ  cult and would ask for more  explanation. As a reply, he summarizes the crucial points of his explanation  so far in the rest of the treatise. This little vignette on the audience’s reaction  provides a rare glimpse of the live atmosphere of his lectures and structurally marks the inception of the concluding chapters. Plotinus construes his expla-nation in the form of an imaginary dialogue with his audience. The difﬁ  culty lies in how to distinguish substantial numbers (the num- bered numbers) from monadic numbers (the numbering numbers). 128 He  begins with monadic number in physical reality. For example, Plotinus says, when you count one dog and one man to be two or even two men, you should not consider this two to be substance in the intelligible ( arithmos houtos ouk  ousia ), nor even a kind of substance that is in the perceptible things ( oud’  hôs en aisthêtois ), but purely quantitative measurement ( katharôs poson ). 129 If  you split this two, you make the two new ones as the quantitative principle of number two. 130 Bu t this quan ti tati ve princi ple, he insists, does not represen t  the unity of two underlying intelligible realities. If these two underlying real- ities are activities of substance and they form a unity, this two is a substantial two, different from a monadic two. 131 124. VI.6.15.37–38. 125.

Let us say a dyad, for example. Each one of them is a dyad, not by count-ing them quantitatively as two ones, 132 but by grasping them as the unity  (henotês ) of two underlying principles. This dyad is a substantial dyad,133 as  the substance of the thing (a man or a dog) holds its nature together.134 As  a result, we do not make a man or a dog two by counting. The substantial dyad of a man or a dog has its own existence in the intelligible and does not  come together when we number. The summary of the difference between the two kinds of number reinforces one last time Plotinus’ principal dis-agreement with Aristotle’s view of quantity as a primary kind and number  as its species. Naturally, the rejection of Aristotle’s view that number is multiplicity  of units raises the question of exactly how substantial number is imitated by monadic number in enumerating physical reality. Plotinus’ answer is that the monadic number externally assigns a certain quantity to a thing, while the substantial number internally shapes the substantial unity of the Form of this thing. The substantial number, he clariﬁ  es, is latent in us when we  do not count. 135 When we count, we convert the internal nonquantitative  n u m b e r  i n t o  a n  e x t e r n a l  q u a n t i t a t i v e  e x p r e s s i o n ,  j u s t  a s  w h e n  w e  w a l k ,  w e   externalize or actualize the primary kind of movement.136 Since number is  substance and thus in the substance that makes us and not in body or mag- nitude, he argues, it follows that soul is number. Plotinus’ precise words are that soul is number, if it is a substance.137 The modality of the statement comes from the soul’s duality in its unde-scended intelligible part and descended corporeal part. The number of body is substance in the way that is proper for body, he clariﬁ  es, while the number  of soul is substance in the way that is proper for soul. He gives an example with a triad in the intelligible: if a triad is represented in a living being in the intelligible, it is a substantial triad ( trias ousiôdês ); and if this triad is not  in a particular living being but is generally in real being ( holôs trias en tôi  132.

The discussion of numbered numbers and numbering numbers, albeit  enigmatic and not elaborated by later Neoplatonists, elucidates Plotinus’  interpretation of Plato’s true number at the onset of Plotinus’ investigation of the three hypotheses on the relationship between number and substance in VI. 6.4.21–25. As the numbering number only actualizes the numbered  numbers, the numbering soul does not produce number but only arouses in i tself the i dea o f n um ber from the diff erence in sensib le things. 139 In count- ing, Plotinus vividly says that you generate the quantitative number in your-self and actualize the quantity and the dyad. 140 When you say that the form  of virtue is a tetrad, you actualize the quantity of the substantial tetrad and attribute to virtue the substantial tetrad that is in you. 141 The activities of substantial number suggest that Soul is number. As  discussed in V. 1.5,142 the One is prior to the Indeﬁ  ni t e Dy ad an d , w h en th e  Indeﬁ  nite Dyad is deﬁ  ned by the One, it becomes Intellect and substan- tial number ( arithmos hôs ousia ). The different activities of substantial num- ber have their own ontological hierarchy: substantial number, as the uniﬁ  ed  n u m b e r  o f  B e i n g ,  i s  a n  i m a g e  o f  t h e  O n e ;  t h e  u n f o l d e d  n u m b e r  o f  b e i n g s  represents the principle of otherness in the intelligible realm; the encompass-ing number of the Complete Living Being represents the principle of same-ness in the intelligible; monadic number is an image of substantial number; Intellect, as number moving in itself, is an image of the Indeﬁ  nite Dyad; and  Soul is an image of Intellect. 143 Since Intellect is n umber mo ving in itself,144 Soul, as an image of Intellect, must also resemble number moving in itself.145 If substantial number instantiates Intellect and Soul is an image of Intellect, then Soul also contains an image of substantial number. The above activities  of substantial number relate to the intelligible as a whole, and likewise, Soul  imitates them all. Plotinus has already hinted at the mimetic nature of Soul in the comparison that Soul holds all things together in itself, just as Intellect embraces all beings together in the intelligible realm. 146 The difference  138.

Soul moves, unfolds, embraces, stops in the creation of the sensible reality as image of the intelligible. In these activities, Soul deciphers the ontological code in substantial number into corporeal and quantitative multiplicity. As the image of Intellect, Soul also inherits Intellect’s one-in-many  nature. In VI. 2.4, the multiplicity of Soul is explained by a comparison to  the body. The body, being many and one, is divisible into many innumerable parts. Soul, which also is a unity of many and one, is not divisible because its parts are not spatially separated. 148 I t  i s  m a n y  n o t  a s  a  c o m p o u n d  f r o m   many, but as one nature, which is many.149 With its one-in-many nature,  Soul creates the plurality of bodies, animals, and plants in physical reality  and preserves them from innumerable inﬁ  nity by encompassing them in its  one nature. Soul comprises all sensible things in one as Intellect and the  Complete Living Being embrace the whole number of beings in one. Regarding knowledge, Soul, like Intellect, cognizes itself as multiplicity  separated from the One. Soul’s knowledge of the One is different from Soul’s knowledge of itself, just as Intellect’s seeing of the One in Being is different fr o m In t e ll ect ’ s see in g o f i tse lf in be in gs . 150 Because of the basic nondiscur- siveness of the One, Soul does not reason the One, but understands the One  by “a presence superior to knowledge. ” 151 But to acquire knowledge of itself,  Soul thinks discursively. The language with which Plotinus explains the dianoetic reasoning of  Soul is also important. Discursive thought is deﬁ  ned as separation ( aposta- sis) from the One 152 as “Soul goes past the One and falls into number and  147. VI.6.15.21–23. That Soul and Intellect are number is an original  Pythagorean doctrine ( Metaph. 985b), adopted later by Xenocrates, for whom  Soul is a self-moving number ( autokinêton ; Iamblichus, De Anima 4.8). 148.

Separation from the One is knowledge that unfolds  into many characteristics and accumulates propositions. This interpretation  is important, because ﬁ  rst, it explains Soul’s dianoetic connection with num- ber and multiplicity, and second, it reinforces the notion that any reasoned  account and deﬁ  nition are attempts at peeling away the layers of proposi- tional thinking to uncover the underlying truth beyond. Like Intellect, Soul, when it knows itself, becomes number and many; 155 while contemplating the  One, Soul regains its unity and nondiscursiveness.156 In Soul, the dichotomy between One and multiplicity is most striking.  It involves the intelligible and the corporeal, the immortal and the mortal, the continuous and the discrete, substantial number and monadic number. Since it includes a multiplicity of complete opposites, the unity of Soul has been consistently an object of philosophers’ interests. In his commentary on the Timaeus,  Proclus summarizes the prevalent theories on the representa- tion of the soul: Before those who earlier than we have attempted to explain the  nature of the soul arithmetically ( mathêmatikên poiountes tên ousian  tês psychês ) [157] as some medium between the physical and the meta- physical, it is asserted by those who call the soul a number that it  consists of unity, as something indivisible ( hoi men arithmon autên  eipontes ek monados poiousin hôs ameristou ), and of the Indeﬁ  nite  Dyad as something divisible ( ek tou aoristou dyados hôs meristês ).  Others, however, who conceive of the soul as of a geometrical ﬁ  g- ure ( geômetrikên hypostasin ) ,  i n s i s t  t h a t  i t  c o n s i s t s  o f  a  p o i n t  a n d   distance ( ousan ek sêmeiou kai diastaseôs ); of which the ﬁ  rst is indi- visible, and the second divisible.

On the one hand, Plotinus’ distinction between  substantial and quantitative number falls along the lines of Numenius’ under- s t a n d i n g  o f  n u m b e r  a s  t h a t  w h i c h  i s  i n d i v i s i b l e ,  c o r r e s p o n d i n g  t o  s u b s t a n -tial number, and that which is divisible, corresponding to monadic number. On the other hand, the geometrical construction of the soul as a point and dimensionality represents ﬁ  guratively the relationship between the higher  and the lower part of Soul, between the universal Soul and the individual soul, and between the One and multiplicity. 161 We have discussed the former  thoroughly, and the latter requires our present attention. The Unﬁ  gured Figure of Soul’s Dance The context in which Plotinus reaches the conclusion that Soul is number is also signiﬁ  cant for the understanding of the role of Soul in the structure of  the universe. Alluding to Plato’s elaborate explanation of the mathematically  harmonious making of the world-soul in Ti.36a6–37a1, Plotinus explains in  VI.6.16.43–44 that soul is number and melody, since intelligible substance  itself is number and melody. In the Ennead explicating the nature of the  intelligible realm (V. 9), Plotinus states: “indeed all music, since the ideas  which it has are concerned with rhythm and melody, would be of the same  kind as the art which is concerned with intelligible number.”  162 He compares  the art of music to “the art of intelligible number” ([ technê ] peri ton noê- ton arithmon echousa ), in order to explain that not all imitative arts produce  158.

His state-ment recalls a series of memorable images of dancing, dancers, and dances throughout the Enneads.  For example, the cosmic dance of the heavenly bod- ies in IV. 4.33–34, the hypostatic dance of Soul around Intellect in I. 8.2, and  the divine dance of the individual soul, free from its corporeal imprisonment and reunited with its intelligible source in VI. 9.9–10. All these images per- tain to the intelligible and visually convey the order and the harmony at the cosmic stage of the universe. But how do music and dancing relate to the role of number in the intelligible realm? Plotinus’ use of metaphors is one of the most captivating features of his  style and has long been an object of scholarly attention. Gerson has suggested that usually there is a deeper ontological meaning in these metaphors. 163 In  support of his view, I think that the dancing scenes in the Enneads  are liter- ary metaphors of the harmonious universe, but, at a deeper level, there is a certain literalness to them that conceptually reveals the inherent ontological roles of substantial number in the structure of the intelligible. This ontolog-ical movement of number, which organizes the kosmos noêtos,  originates and  directs the circular cosmic dances of Intellect and Soul. First, let us go back to the passage cited in the beginning of this   section, and ask what Plotinus means by “the art of intelligible number.” In VI.3.16.18–24, he explains that some arts, such as lyre playing, contain sense- perceived activities ( energeiai aisthêtai ), while others, such as “the works of  the soul” ( tas de autês tês psychês pragmateias ), relate to the intelligible realm.  On Plato’s authority, he also distinguishes other arts, such as geometry, arith-m e t i c ,  a s t r o n o m y ,  a n d  m u s i c ,  t h a t  o c c u p y  a n  i n t e r m e d i a t e  p o s i t i o n  b e t w e e n  sensible reality and the realm of the Forms. As he states, “geometry is con-cerned with intelligibles and it must be placed there [in the intelligible].”  164 Geometry theorizes in ﬁ  gures the concepts of relation, proportion, and   measurement. This kind of conceptualization uses the monadic numbers as  measures of magnitudes, however. All these arts use number as their medium and work with quantiﬁ  able  proportions in space and time.165 Plotinus, too, thinks that the arts relate  closely to something that is beyond sense perception. While Plato uses con- ventional mathematics to demonstrate their higher noetic quality, Plotinus emphasizes the nonquantitative nature of substantial number and geometri-cal ﬁ gures. His attention is exclusively on their role in the intelligible, where  163. Gerson ( 1997:298–299). 164. V.9.11.24–26:gevmetr€a d¢ noht«n oÔsa takt°a §ke›.

Thus, the art of intelligible number in Plotinus’ comparison between music and number refers to the ontological, not sense-perceptible, activities of substantial number in the intelligible. In VI. 6.17.5–7, Plotinus borrows the geometrical ﬁ  gure of the line as an  example from Aristotle’s explanation of continuous quantity  166 to explain that  a line, in the intelligible, is unlimited, not because there is an intelligible line that is unlimited, but because we can always think of a longer line: It is impossible to attach a mental image to the things which really 1.  exist in the intelligible realm. Hence the line in the intelligible is unlimited in the sense that it is not 2.  of deﬁ  nite numbered length. Since a line is what proceeds from one point and over one distance, it 3.  is posterior to number because the one is observed in it. Limit is not thought to be included in the absolute line, since the line 4.  in the intelligible cannot be measured quantitatively. How is it possible for the absolute line to start from a point and yet be  unlimited? For Plotinus, the line is both an intellectual thing ( noeron ) and  somehow a real thing ( pôs to pragma ). All ﬁ  gures in the intelligible (point,  line, plane, and solid) do not have quantity or quality but exist as “unﬁ  g- ured ﬁ  gures” ( aschêmatista schêmata ) before they are extended into bodies  (VI.6.17.25–26): Figure, then, is always one in real being ( schêma hen en tôi onti ), but it has distinctions in it either in the living being ( en tôi zôiôi ) or before the living being ( pro tou zôiou ). But I mean “has distinc- tions” not in the sense that it has acquired size ( ouch hoti emegeth- ynthê ), but because it has been divided ( hoti hekaston emeristhê pros  hekaston ), each part of it in correspondence to each being, and given  to the bodies there in the intelligible. (VI. 6.17.28–31) As substantial numbers are the paradigms of monadic numbers and the  henads are molds for beings, so too, in the intelligible, unﬁ  gured ﬁ  gures are  the antecedents of ﬁ  g u r e s ,  a n d ,  i n  t h i s  s e n s e ,  a r e  u n l i m i t e d .  I f  i n t e l l i g i b l e   ﬁ gures are unlimited, then what kind of division does Plotinus have in mind?  The answer is that the division of being by substantial number generates the beings in Intellect. 167 166. Cat. 6.5a1–14.</p><div id="pagenum"><p>167.

(VI.6.18.6–12) The existence of being is a measure—itself a result of the division of Being by and according to substantial number. In VI. 2.22.19–20, we also learn that,  before Intellect sees all beings, they are unlimited ( apeira ), but as soon as  it comprehends them ( tôi de heni perilêphthenta ) ,  th e y  arri v e  a t  n um be r  ( eis  arithmon erchetai ). Intellect also holds Soul, which comes after it, so that  Soul is in number. Only the lowest part of the soul, the one that is respon-sible for grasping and shaping matter, is altogether inﬁ  nite ( to de eschaton  autês êdê apeiron pantapasi,  VI.2.22.22–23). 171 T h a t  n u m b e r  i s  u n l i m i t e d  i n   the intelligible realm means that beings exist there without measure.172 But  as soon as Intellect sees them in the Complete Living Being, they show their number, magnitude, and quality. 173 The ontogenetic activities of substantial number in Being, Intellect,  beings, and the Complete Living Being construct the unﬁ  gured ﬁ  gure of  the intelligible.

Dance is a most suitable analogy because, although it  is based on measurements of space and rhythm, it conveys them implicitly. When one observes dance, one is not made aware of the actual measure-ments but of their effect. The unﬁ  gured ﬁ  gure of the intelligible, although  not measured quantitatively, also implicitly conveys its effect in the circular dance of Soul. 174 Plotinus’ idea of the circle that equally encompasses the plurality of its  parts follows the long tradition of geometrical representation of the compo-sition of the universe, documented in Alexander of Aphrodisias’ commentary  on Aristotle’s metaphysics: Plato and the Pythagoreans thought that the numbers were the cause  of being, for they took the ﬁ  rst and non-composite as cause, surfaces  being ﬁ  rst in relation to bodies, being more simple and independent  in their being of body, lines being ﬁ  rst in relation to surfaces, and  points are ﬁ  rst in relation to lines, being totally non-composite and  having nothing prior to them. ( In Metaph. 55.20–26) 175 This is the Peripatetic report of how Plato views the generation of the uni-verse as a geometrical progression from a discrete point to a line to a plane to a solid. 176 O’Meara represents it as shown in ﬁ  gure 5.1.177 I will not digress into  the mathematical history of this representation since it is outside of Plotinus’ interest itself. I will point out, however, that he uses a similar geometrical progression to explain the productive power of number that constructs the intelligible realm. But his understanding of the constitutive role of num-ber literally rounds out the corners of O’Meara’s ﬁ  gurative representation  of Plato’s cosmology. The ﬁ  gure of the circle conveys the transcendence of  the One, not in every corner of the cube but in every segment of circle of the kosmos noêtos  and the kosmos aisthêtos.  The One is the single point from  which Intellect unrolls outward, and the universe explodes into multiplicity,  a l t h o u g h  i t  i s  s t i l l  u n i ﬁ  ed by the limit of the circle’s circumference. 178 The  fact that all elements of the circle are listed in the passage above emphasizes  174. I am thankful to the anonymous reviewer for the reference to  Olympiodorus’ treatment of Plato’s interpretation of circular dance as an  imitation of the heavens, In Grg. 5.5 and of soul’s circularity in 30 .1–2. 175.

Plotinus, too, cautions  us that comparing the One to the single point ( sêmeion ) is only a result of our  desire and necessity to indicate the One to each other; otherwise the absolute  One beyond Being is not a point ( sêmeion ) or a unit ( monas ),179 although the  uniﬁ ed number of Being is. The list of the properties of substantial number in VI. 6.9.29–31 constructs  the intelligible realm in a strictly mathematical progression.180 Substantial  number does not arrange the multiplicity of intelligible beings into a kosmos  noêtos,  for they have never been in chaos or disorder, but, by dividing Being,  the substantial number itself creates a kosmos noêtos.  To visualize Plotinus’  description, we can mark Being as a point representing the uniﬁ  ed number  of Being, the Intellect as a concentric circle representing the number mov- ing in itself, all beings as lines unfolding from Being to the circle of the Intellect, and ﬁ  nally the Complete Living Being as a sphere encompassing  all the above. Plotinus himself explains that substantial number constructs the intelligible realm as “an intelligible sphere ( sphaira noêtê ) embracing the  form imposed upon the universe.”  181 Because substantial number does not  measure quantitatively beings and the intelligible realm, this image is not spatial or temporal and yet is a literal and iconic representation of the archi-tecture of the intelligible according to the ontogenetic activities of substantial number. The best parallel to the metaphysical qualities of Plotinus’ image is perhaps Parmenides’ own description of being as “completed, / from every direction like the bulk of a well-rounded sphere, / everywhere from the cen-tre equally matched.”  182 Plotinus’ vision of the circular motion of the universe, which is rooted  in a center that is beyond it, closely relates to the circular heavenly models  179.

The point from which the equidistant lines derive is called the center of the  circle.184 Proclus acknowledges the particular metaphysical usefulness of the  ﬁ gure of the circle as such: The ﬁ  rst and simplest and most perfect of the ﬁ  gures is the cir- cle . I t is su peri or to all so li d ﬁ  gures because its being is of simpler  order, and it surpasses other plane ﬁ  gures by reason of its homo-geneity and self-identity. It corresponds to the Limit, the number one, and all the things in the column of the better. . . . If you divide the universe into the heavens and the world of generation, you will assign the circular form to the heavens and the straight line to the  world of generation; for insofar as the circular form is found in the changes and ﬁ  gures of the world of generation, it is divided from  above, from the heavenly order. It is because of the circular revo- lution of the heavens that generation returns in a circle upon itself and brings its unstable mutability into a deﬁ  nite cycle. If you divide  bodiless things into soul and Intellect, you will say that the circle has the character of Intellect, the straight line that of soul. This is why the soul, as she reverts to Intellect, is said to move in a circle. (In Euc. 147.8–19) 185 I cite this passage at length because it presents the synthesized ﬁ  nal result  of what Plotinus has set out to do in the  Enneads.  Proclus’ commentary on  Euclid’s deﬁ  nition of the circle demonstrates the path of Plotinus’ complete  philosophical exegesis. The suitability of the circle to express the simplicity  of a starting point from which multiplicity expands outward until it is con-tained inward by a circumscribing line is beyond doubt. This becomes clear when we relate the hypostases to the elements of the circle. Proclus conceptualizes a clear geometrical distinction between the cir- cular shape of the heavens and Intellect and the linear sense-perceptible pro-gression of soul. Based on Plotinus’ distinction of number, we can equate the former with the nonquantitative substantial numbers and the unﬁ  gured  intelligible ﬁ  gure of the circle, and the latter with soul as the linear quanti- tative enumerating principle in physical reality.

T o illustrate what he means, he describes that “soul is composed of the part which is above and that which is attached to that higher world but has ﬂ  owed out as far as these parts, like  a line from a center” ( hoion grammês ek kentrou ). 189 For Plotinus, Being “produces the real beings when moving according  to number.”190 The motion of number begins with Intellect, which exists by  thinking itself and thinking all the individual intellects in itself. Thinking for Intellect is moving within itself. This motion is introverted, self-reﬂ  exive,  all-inclusive, and without direction, except for the dianoetic conception of inward and outward. Therefore, the motion is circular, though not in the sense of circular direction, but rather that a circle circumscribes the movement. 191 The uniﬁ  ed number of Being is the point of Intellect’s gaze upon the One  before it realizes its multiplicity. By the moving-in-itself number of Intellect,  the individual forms come into existence as a number that unfolds itself from  the uniﬁ  ed number of Being. The individual beings do not continue their  unfolding motion ad inﬁ  nitum. They are encompassed by the number of the  Complete Living Being. Thus, the intelligible world moves circularly, fold-ing out and folding in, resembling the breathing in and out of an ensouled organism. Plotinus perceives ﬁ  guratively the course of this ontological pro- gression as follows: “[Intellect] became like a circle unfolding itself, shape  and surface and circumference and center and radii, some parts above and some below.”  192 The unfolding of the circle of Intellect ( exelixas ) results in  186. Kutash ( 1994 :105,112). 187. Kutash ( 1994 :109–110). 188. Among Proclus’ predecessors, Plotinus must have had the most sway  in the formulation of Proclus’ view, since all the elements of his commentary on  Euclid’s deﬁ  nition of a circle are found in Plotinus. 189.

But when Intellect sees, and thus thinks all intellects or all beings in itself, it holds them and surrounds them in the Com p lete Li ving Being as encom passing n um ber (VI . 6.31), which resembles  a full sphere. 195 The sphere of the living being is, then, the ﬁ  gure of the uni- verse ( to te tou pantos schêma ) to which Plotinus refers in the beginning of his  discussion of the ﬁ  gures in the intelligible (VI. 6.17.23–24).196 The ﬁ  nal product of this progression is the encompassing number of  t h e  C o m p l e t e  L i v i n g  B e i n g .  I V . 4.32 sheds more light on Plotinus’ view of  the Complete Living Being by quoting Ti.30d1–31a1 that the universe ( to pan) is “a single living being which encompasses all the living beings that  are within it”; “it has one soul which extends to all its parts, in so far as each individual thing is a part of it” (IV. 4.32.4–7). Plotinus interprets Plato’s  deﬁ nition in terms of his own ontological classiﬁ  cation to mean that “this  one universe is all bound together in shared experience and it is like one living creature” (IV. 4.32.13–14).

The rational principle  which orchestrates this cosmic dance is the substantial number. It creates harmonious movements between all individual beings, Intellect, and Being. Plotinus’ dancing metaphor illustrates the structure of the universe not in situ, but contemplatively in action; not static and devoid of life, but dynamic and “boiling with life.” He further extends the simile by comparing the orderly and yet different movements of the limbs of the dancer’s body to the image of the whole universe, which “actively lives its own complete life, moving its great parts within itself, and continually rearranging them.” 198 This m o ti o n is n o t in s p ace o r in tim e; ra th e r , i t is co n t e m p la ti v e , possess-ing the knowledge of the intelligible realm.

Quoting Plato’s Second Letter  (312e1–4), Plotinus explains  the chain of ontological command: That Intellect is the ﬁ  rst act of the Good and the ﬁ  rst substance  (prôtê energeia and prôtê ousia ); the Good stays still in himself; but  Intellect moves about him in its activity, as also it lives around him.  And soul dances around intellect outside ( hê de exôthen peri touton  choreuousa psychê ), and looks to it, and in contemplating its interior  sees God through it.

If we further consider the hypostatic dance of Soul in the intelligible  realm in the context of Plotinus’ understanding of the origin of multiplicity as a separation from the One in VI. 6, we discover that the motions of Soul  coincide with the two directions in which multiplicity exists. The ﬁ  rst is a  motion away from the One, which gives existence to all beings and Soul, as different from the One. This direction is represented by the external dance o f So ul aro un d In te ll ect . Th e secon d m o ti on o f m ul ti p li ci ty is in trospecti v e and toward the One, which preserves multiplicity from dissipation into inﬁ  n- ity. This direction is represented by the inward dance of Soul around its cen-ter in an attempt to see its intelligible source. While Soul dances externally outside Intellect, it is turned internally toward Intellect and the One. The ontological composition in this explanation can be represented geo- metrically as in ﬁ  gure 5.4. generating sense-perceptible reality, see III. 4.1.

As a static image of the One, Being is a holding place for the One in the noetic architecture of the universe. 203 The One is the single source from which Intellect unrolls and the universe expands in multiplicity, uniﬁ  e d  b y  t h e  e n c o m p a s s i n g  l i n e  o f  t h e  c i r c l e ’ s   circumference. 204 Plotinus cautions us that comparing the One to the single  point ( sêmeion ) is only a dianoetic result of our desire and need to indicate  the One to each other. So, the absolute One beyond Being is not a point  (sêmeion ) or a unit ( monas ),205 but the uniﬁ  ed number of Being is. The cos- mic dance of Intellect and Soul, then, is circular because it follows the onto- logical activities of substantial number in the intelligible realm. The closing chapters of the very last treatise of the Enneads  in Porphyry’s  arrangement (VI. 9.8–11) describe the cosmic dance of the enlightened indi- vidual soul that has achieved its complete union with the One. In fact, this is the last image that the Enneads  leave in our mind’s eye. These dancing  scenes not only metaphorically convey the complete harmony of the universe, but also reveal the ontological truth of the intelligible. Plotinus perceives the universe, like a sphere full of life, which derives from the One and returns to the One according to the concentric numbered dance of Soul around Intellect, and of Intellect around the One. 206 Intellect and Soul perform their  cosmic dance on the stage of the universal poetic creation207 to the rhythm  of substantial number. 203. Similarly, Corrigan ( 2005 :28) describes Plotinus’ circle analogy as “a  circle unfolding itself into radii and circumference but still rooted in its centre,  which is itself rooted in the centre of all centres beyond it.” 204.

Armstrong  criticizes Porphyry for taking “a most unfortunate liberty” in creating “an extremely unsystematic presentation of a systematic philosophy”; 1 Gerson  ﬁ nds the arrangement to be “a seriously disruptive division”;2 and O’Meara  dismisses it as “wholly artiﬁ  cial and sometimes misleading.” 3 Consequently,  scholars suggest two alternative organizations of the Enneads.  The ﬁ  rst recon- structs the conceptual unity of certain treatises, such as the  Großschrift  (III.8; V.8; V.5; II.9), which Porphyry disperses throughout the collection.4 The sec- ond reads the treatises in Porphyry’s chronological order (listed in VP4–6) in an attempt to show the development of Plotinus’ philosophy itself.5 While the communis opinio  of Porphyry’s arrangement stems from our  analytically trained perception of how philosophical writing should be orga-nized, I think we must also try to understand his work within the context of both Plotinus’ thought and the Neopythagorean fashion of the time. Porphyry’s arrangement does not simply embellish Plotinus’ corpus like the Muses’ ennead, crowning the nine books of Herodotus’ Histories : 6 as  a student of Plotinus and a former member of the Neopythagorean school, Porphyry would have understood his task to be editing and arranging his master’s works in an order complying with the tenets of the presented phi-l o s o p h y .

He not only collected and edited his master’s trea-tises but, unlike his predecessors, encouraged him to write them. Regardless of Porphyry’s motives, his close association with Plotinus suggests that we should give more credit to his editorial work than we have done. 9 In the beginning of VP, Porphyry declares Plotinus’ approval of his  editorial role: “I myself, Porphyry of T yre, was one of Plotinus’s closest friends, and he entrusted to me the editing of his writings” ( VP 7.49–51). 10 Considering Porphyry’s aspirations to be regarded as Plotinus’ intellectual  heir,11 we should suspect that he would use more than sheer numerical ele- gance in his task, especially as his ﬂ  agship role as the editor of the Enneads was the key to his self-promotion. Toward the end of VP,  Porphyry again  justiﬁ  es his editorial authority: He [Plotinus] himself entrusted me with the arrangement and edit- ing of his books ( tên diataxin kai tên diorthôsin tôn bibliôn poieisthai  7. Aristotle’s silence upon the hexad and the ennead in Met. A  and M also  grants the arrangement a programmatic signiﬁ  cance for Neopythagorean number  symbolism. The omission is more apparent on Burkert’ s list ( 1972:466–7), which  is based on Aristotle and Alexander’s commentary on Aristotle’s text. 8. On the Platonists, see Tarrant ( 1993:1–103); Mansfeld ( 1994 :58–84). On  Andronicus, see Barnes ( 1997:1–69); Pfeiffer ( 1968 :264,273). 9. According to VP4–6, Plotinus, at a more advanced age, began to write  the tractates in September 253 and stopped only at his death in 270. On the  chronology of Plotinus’ writing, see Dillon ( 1992 :191). On Porphyry’ s edition,  see Goulet-Cazé ( 1982 : vol. 1 ,280–7 and 294 –307 ). 10.

I followed  the example of Apollodorus of Athens, who collected the works of Epicharmus the comedian into ten volumes, and Andronicus the Peripatetic, who classiﬁ  ed the works of Aristotle and Theophrastus  according to subject, bringing together the discussions of related topics. ( VP24.2–11) 12 Taken at face value, this statement conﬁ  rms Porphyry’s motivation and ambi- tion. He perceives his work on the Enneads  as a natural continuation of the  Hellenistic and Roman publishing trend. The collections of Plato’s dialogues  were constantly reorganized after Plato’s death. But the corpus Aristotelicum had a less fortunate fate. After many vagaries, a number of Aristotle’s texts  fell into the possession of Andronicus, who uniﬁ  ed them thematically. The  references to Andronicus and Apollodorus help us understand better how Porphyry himself perceived his work, in what state he received the treatises, and what exactly he did to them. Porphyry organized the tractates themat-ically in Andronicus’ fashion and divided them into a signiﬁ  cant number of  volumes qua Apollodorus. 13 In his mind, he did not compare his work to the  standard work of Plato’s editors, who edited already established collections, but to the work of the editors who made collections from scratch. Since Plotinus’ writings grew naturally but sporadically from his lec- tures over a period of seventeen years, the treatises obviously needed editing and organization. The phrase “in confusion in order of time” ( kata chro- nous . . . phyrdên, VP 24.5–6) denotes not only the disorderly condition in  which Porphyry received the treatises but also the condition that prompted Plotinus to ask his disciple to publish them in “arrangement” ( diataxis ) and  “editing” ( diorthôsis ) (VP24.2). Armstrong, remarking that diorthôsis  “need  imply no more than the correction of the spelling and supply of punctua-tion,” does not comment on the connotation of diataxis,  despite the word  order, in which the latter immediately precedes the former. 14 The combined  12. Both Barnes and Blumenthal note the importance of Porphyry’ s remark  recognizing Andronicus’ contribution to the collection of Aristotle’s works, later  overshadowed by Alexander of Aphrodisias. Barnes ( 1997:37–9); Blumenthal  (1996 :8, n, 6 ). Pfeiffer ( 1968 :264,273) also documents the two scholars’  editorship with Porphyry’s testimony in VP. 13. Barnes ( 1997:37–38). 14. According to Armstrong ( 1967 :217), there is “no reason to suppose that </p><div id="pagenum"><p>Porphyry did not do his work as editor conscientiously and accurately.” But he </p></div><div id="pagenum"><p>PLOTINUS ON NUMBER 134</p></div><p id="page">use of the two terms and the orthographic meaning of diorthôsis  suggest that  we should interpret diataxis  to mean, speciﬁ  cally, arranging the treatises.15 At ﬁ rst glance, Porphyry’s organization of the treatises from the easiest  to the most difﬁ  cult topics does not directly reﬂ  ect the division of philosophy  into ethics, physics, and logic, which governs Plato’s collections. Albinus’  organization adapts this tripartite division and further divides Plato’s works into ﬁ  ve subtypes of peirastic, maieutic, hyphegetic, logical, and anatreptic  dialogues. Thrasyllus’ division, followed later by Theon of Smyrna, groups the dialogues into tetralogies following the pattern of three tragedies and a satyr play. 16 Edwards recognizes that Porphyry’s arrangement moves in a  similar direction but sees stronger kinship with the division of body, soul, and spirit, found in Origen’s De Principiis  (4.2.4). 17 As w e will see later , his  conjecture is all the more convincing in that it captures the anagogical path on which the treatises unfold the essence of Plotinus’ universe, because Porphyry believes that his editorship is central to the teaching, promotion, and preservation of Plotinus’ philosophy. 18 Ennead VI.6 Why should we look next into Plotinus’ concepts of multiplicity and number for a possible answer to Porphyry’ s arrangement? Because, as we have deter-mined in this book, the two concepts lay the foundation of Plotinus’ under-standing of the composition of the universe. If we are to concern ourselves with studying the ordering of a multitude of treatises into a whole, then focusing on Plotinus’ signature view of the universe as one-in-many seems to be suitable and logical. From Porphyry’s editorial standpoint, if the Enneads  are going to present  Plotinus’ view of the universe, regardless of whether Plotinus cares or not, they can do so only if they are published as a multitude of treatises, organized in a way that demonstrates their unity. For Porphyry, to induce kosmos  in the  presentation of the treatises is to arrange them in a way that “inwardly,” through introspection, reveals to the reader the essence of Plotinus’ universe.  also judges that “Porphyry did no more than correct the spelling, etc., of his  master’s carelessly written and unrevised manuscripts.” 15. Leopardi translates them as ordo  and emendatio  in Moreschini ( 1982). 16. Tarrant ( 1993:41,89–107). 17. Edwards ( 2000 :51, n. 309 ). 18. Eustochius (c. 270) published another edition of the Enneads,  quoted by  Eusebius in Praeparatio Evangelica.  But all extant manuscripts of the Enneads transmit the treatises according to Porphyry’s edition. Cf. Henry ( 1935); Goulet-</p><div id="pagenum"><p>Cazé ( 1982 :287–294); for a concordance of the two editions, see Henry ( 1938).</p></div><div id="pagenum"><p>UNITY OF THOUGHT AND WRITING 135</p></div><p id="page">If we consider each Ennead as a whole, we ﬁ  nd that the ﬁ  rst Ennead  includes  works on the spiritual nature of man; the second Ennead  deals with physical  matter; the third explains how the physical world relates to the intelligible  realm; the fourth discusses the sensible and intelligible nature of soul; the ﬁ fth espouses Intellect as an intermediary between Soul and the One; and  the sixth Ennead  culminates in the discussion of the most difﬁ  cult concepts  pertinent to the intelligible realm, including those of number and the One  itself. 19 This thematic arrangement moves inward from the sense-perceptible  multiplicity through the hypostases of Soul and Intellect to culminate in the  subject of the One.20 It turns the multiplicity of the Enneads  inward toward  their most central topic. Given Plotinus’ understanding of the ontogenic role of substantial num- ber in the intelligible world, detailed in the preceding chapters, the meaning  of Porphyry’s arrangement of the Enneads  emerges as a multiplicity ordered  by number. Just as substantial number organizes the intelligible realm as  many-in-one, so does its material image, monadic number, arrange the mul-tiplicity of the treatises into kosmos,  which is turned inward toward its intel- ligible essence. If the treatises were going to present Plotinus’ complete view of how the universe was organized, then they could do so only if they re-created its organization. By ordering them into six Enneads,  the monadic  number, like all material things, conveys, yet “faintly,”  21 the organization of  Plotinus’ universe. “Six Along with the Nines” Recent scholarship on the nondiscursive nature of Neoplatonic thinking h a s  d e m o n s t r a t e d  t h a t  “ t h e  l a n g u a g e  o f  N e o p l a t o n i s m  i s  t h e  l a n g u a g e  o f  symbols.”  22 While the relation between text and symbol is more apparent in  the later Neoplatonic tradition, Porphyry’s contribution to this tradition will remain inevitably opaque due to the paucity of evidence in his extant works. Nevertheless, being a “Plotinian Platonist,”  23 Porphyry is intimately  familiar  19. This progression does not follow the tripartite division of the Platonic  corpus. The part dealing with logic is replaced by metaphysics and spirituality.  See pp. 133–134. O’Meara ( 1993:9) describes it as “a path for the ascent of the  soul of the reader, going from the ﬁ  rst steps to the ultimate goal of Plotinian  philosophy.” 20. Cf. Bréhier ( 1958:30): “The style of Plotinus is one of the most  beautiful we have because it always expresses the movement of a living thought.” 21. VI.6.18.24:émudr«w. 22.

In his lengthy quo- tation of Longinus’ letter in VP 20–21, he mentions not a few, but all the  names of the “Neopythagorean underground” 24—Cronius, Moderatus,  Thrasyllus, Numenius, and Ammonius Saccas, the teacher of Plotinus  himself ( VP3).25 With this entourage in mind, the question of Porphyry’s  arrangement of Plotinus’ works must be related to traditional Pythagorean  and Neopythagorean numeric symbolism.26 The later Neoplatonic and Neopythagorean tradition elucidates what  Porphyry might have implied by his notorious perfect ratio of six and nine. Despite the scarcity of original Pythagorean writings, the development of the Pythagorean numerical canon from Philolaus to Proclus is still trace-able. In this continuous span, Aristotle, of course, ﬁ  rst attempts to sys-tematize the circulating Pythagorean views on the metamathematical and metaphysical correspondence between numbers and the universe. Although Aristotle’s work on the Pythagoreans is lost, he discusses Pythagorean numerical symbolism at considerable length throughout Metaphysics  books  A and M.  With the help of Alexander’s commentary on Aristotle’s text,  Burkert reconstructs Aristotle’s list in which the monad is nous and ousia ; the dyad is doxa ; the triad symbolizes a whole with a beginning, middle,  and end; the tetrad is justice; the pentad is marriage; the hebdomad is opportunity; and the decad is the perfect number. 27 The symbolism of each  number on this list is not our concern now; I mention the entire list to point out that there are three obvious omissions, two of which are a pri-mary concern for us. Aristotle not only omits the hexad, the ogdoad, and the ennead from the list but does not even mention them anywhere in his works, not even in the Metaphysics. 28 N o  m a t t e r  w h a t  t h e  a c t u a l  r e a - sons for Aristotle’s conspicuous lacuna, we have no reason to think that  Aristotle omits them intentionally.

Burkert ( 1972:465–482) argues that the mystical notion of numbers as  holding some transcendent truths about the universe does not originate with, but  is articulated most eloquently by, Orpheus and Pythagoras. 27. In his commentary on the Metaphysics,  Alexander clariﬁ  es Aristotle’s  text by matching the Pythagorean numbers to Aristotle’s descriptions. For a  complete discussion, see Burkert ( 1972:466–467). 28.

While Philo places the hexad in the foundation of universal order, Moderatus calls it “a marriage” and “Aphrodite.” 30 The  Theology of Arithmetic  explains these allegories better by deﬁ  ning the hexad  as “the ﬁ  rst perfect number” ( Theol. Ar. 33.2), which “arises out of the ﬁ  rst  even and ﬁ  rst odd numbers, male and female” ( Theol. Ar. 33.5–6), and by  which “the universe is ensouled and harmonized.”31 The hexad is the ﬁ  rst  perfect number, because it is a result of the sum or multiplication of the ﬁ rst three numbers ( 1+2+3 or 1×2×3) and symbolizes the harmoni- ous unity of the primary opposites of male and female. 32 I t  a l s o  a s c ri b e s  t o   soul the animation of the universe brought together as “wholeness of limbs”  (Theol. Ar. 36.31).33 The hexad is kosmos because “the universe, like 6 , is  often seen as composed of opposites in harmony, and the summation of the  word  ‘universe’ is 600 .”34 As a perfect number, the hexad symbolizes order  of multiplicity and harmony of opposites. If we view Porphyry’s arrangement of the treatises according to the  Neopythagorean hexad, the organization of the Enneads  by the number six  overtly corresponds to the organizing role Soul plays in the composition of the physical world. Plotinus does not mention the hexad anywhere in the Enneads.  Nevertheless, this is in accord with his view, discussed earlier, that  29.Ti.43b.2–5; Huffman ( 1993:356–359 ). 30.De Op.

Soul’s role is to embody the ontological content of substantial numbers into monadic numbers counting the visible multiplicity of the universe. For Plotinus, as for Moderatus earlier, Soul is also Aphrodite  (psyche . . . Aphroditê men esti,  III.5.9.33). Since a part of Soul remains in  the intelligible realm and a part of it descends into the sensible world, Soul  unites the material world with its intelligible paradigm by bringing order and correspondence to the universe, and because of this, Plotinus concludes that every soul is Aphrodite ( esti pasa psyche Aphroditê,  VI.9.9.31). 37 For him,  as for the Neopythagoreans, Soul is order, number, and the intermediary  between the visible and invisible realms. But he does not compile a list of the Pythagorean numerical canon in the Enneads  as this is neither in accord with  his interests nor with his style. His primary goal is to explain the ontogenic  role of substantial number in the intelligible realm, regardless of its nomi-nal value (which does not have any ontological meaning), and not the role of its material monadic image. Thus, we should not expect that he would refer explicitly to Soul as the hexad in VI. 6 or elsewhere. In fact, through  the Enneads  and especially in VI. 6, Plotinus sticks to the most popular nom- inal values of number as monad, dyad, triad, tetrad, pentad, and decad. 38 Perhaps the reason for this is that they have the most important ontological  meaning. He uses the monad and the dyad to distinguish them from the Monad and the Indeﬁ  nite Dyad. The triad is the ﬁ  rst odd number, which  represents actual extension from the Monad and the Dyad; 39 the tetrad rep- resents the natural progression of everything in the universe;40 the pentad  35.

Explicating Plato’s myth of the birth of Eros and Aphrodite ( Symp.  203b), he distinguishes two types of Aphrodite: the heavenly Aphrodite  (Aphroditê ourania ) as the Soul, always remaining in the intelligible realm, and  the vulgar Aphrodite ( Aphroditê pandêmos ) as the soul, descending into the  material world (VI. 9.9.29–30). 38. Nikulin ( 2002 :85–88) is of the same mind. He does not even list all  numbers to which Plotinus refers in the Enneads. 39. VI.3.13, VI.6.6.</p><div id="pagenum"><p>40.Theol.

He not only comes from a strong  Neopythagorean background, like Plotinus, but also responds to the revival of Pythagorean numerical symbolism in later Neoplatonism and Neopythagoreanism. Porphyry’s arrangement of the treatises into six groups nondiscursively embodies Plotinus’ understanding that Soul also arranges that which has separated from the One into a one-in-many universe. He animates, to use Neopythagorean language, the multiplicity of the treatises to re-create the organic wholeness of Plotinus’ universe. The numerical symbolism of the ennead is Neopythagorean too. Later  Neoplatonists call the ennead “the greatest of numbers within the decad and an unsurpassable limit.”  43 Th e limi tin g c haract e ris ti c o f th e e nn ead is m os t  suitable for enclosing the number of the individual treatises within itself. While the hexad represents the formation of number and order ( tên autou tou  arithmou eidopoiêsin, Theol. Ar. 36.27), the ennead “marks the end of the for- mation of speciﬁ  c identities” ( horizei goun tên eidopoiêsin, Theol. Ar. 56.25).  As the hexad, like Soul, organizes the groups of the treatises in the body of the collection, the ennead, like the comprising number of the Complete Living Being, limits the number of treatises within each group to the last original number. 44 As the ennead “brings numbers together and makes them  play in concert” ( Theol. Ar. 57.21–4), so does the ennead bring together the  multiplicity of the treatises and turns them inward to its source.45 While the  hexad inscribes the cosmogonical role of soul on the Enneads,  the ennead  symbolizes the completion of the universe. This is why the treatises are not organized in nine groups of six but in six groups of nine. The enneads of the  41.Theol. Ar. 30–31. 42.Theol. Ar. 79. 43.Theol. Ar. 56.24–25. 44.Theol. Ar. 57.7–8: “There is a natural progression up to it, but after  it there is repetition” ( m°xri m¢n går aÈt∞w fusikØ prÒbasiw, metå dÉ  aÈtØn palimpetÆw ). 45. Porphyry embeds the etymology of the ennead as “if it were the ‘henad’  of everything within it, by derivation from the ‘one’ ” ( §nn°aw m¢n k°klhtai  oﬂone‹ •nåw ≤ pãnta §ntÚw aÈt∞w katå parvnum€an toË ßn ,Theol.  Ar.57.4–5) by placing the treatise, devoted to the One ( to hen ), last in his  arrangement. As pointed out by one of the anonymous reviewers, Iamblichus  etymologizes the ennead as “new one” ( hen neon, In Tim.  fr. 53 ), which also </p><div id="pagenum"><p>suits the idea of completing the universe as an image, albeit different, of the One and in this sense “new one.”</p></div><div id="pagenum"><p>PLOTINUS ON NUMBER 140</p></div><p id="page">treatises, circumscribed and thus animated by the hexad of the soul, enclose  everything on the subject of the universe from beginning to end, from henad to ennead. 46 There is nothing more to be said about it outside of Plotinus’  philosophy and outside of the number of the Enneads,  homonymy intended.  Therefore, in the arrangement of the Enneads,  Porphyry reﬂ  ects the growing  importance of the hexad and the ennead before their formal canonization in the Theology of Arithmetic. 47 Porphyry fuses Plotinus’ philosophy with Neopythagorean numeri- cal symbolism to reveal the central organizing theme of Plotinus’ universe. His arrangement of the treatises encrypts numerically the perfect unity of Plotinus’ universe, for which VI. 6 provides the conceptual blueprint. The  teacher’s concept of kosmos as m ul ti p li ci ty o r d e r ed b y n um be r is th e  r easo n  that his student enjoys the perfection of the mathematical ratio of 6 × 9 . The Enneads,  like the universe, unfold outward into multiplicity, while Porphyry’s  arrangement, in turn, enfolds the treatises inward to create an image of the universe according to Plotinus. Porphyry’s arrangement of the Enneads  in six  groups of nine, therefore, is not arbitrary but mandatory for understanding the universe of Plotinus’ thought. 48  46. In Armstrong’s words ( 1988 : vol. 7 ,6), VI. 6 explains “how all reality  proceeds in due order from its source, the One or Good, and how the human  spirit may ﬁ  nd its way back to that source.” 47. With the exception of Plutarch, Moralia 744b, the philosophical  meaning of the ennead is not discussed until Syrianus, In Metaph. 134.14; and  especially Proclus, In R.  vol. 2,237.19,In Cra. 176.62,In Ti.,  vol. 2,127.4. 48. In relation to Thrasyllus’ nine Platonic tetralogies and Porphyry’s six  Plotinian enneads, Mansfeld ( 1994 :65) notes that “such numbers and relations  between numbers according to Platonist and Pythagorean thought are not just an  expression of order, but a cause of order in the ﬁ  rst place.” The two sets are “a  sort of micro-cosmoi.” This chapter was previously published as “Unity of Thought and  Writing: Enn. 6.6 and Porphyry’s Arrangement of the Enneads ” in Classical  Quarterly 58.1 (2008 ): 277–285.

The trouble with numbers starts with the Pythagoreans, who postulate that numbers are the building blocks of the universe. Plato adapts this view to Parmenides’ doctrine that real existence is beyond what the senses perceive, in the realm of thought and speech. The dialectic between One and Many, Limit and Unlimited in the Philebus delineates the future framework of  the question about the relationship between the Forms and numbers. For A r i s t o t l e ,  h o w e v e r ,  n u m b e r  i s  n o t  s u b s t a n c e  b u t  o n l y  a n  a r i t h m e t i c a l  c a t e -gory used by man to manipulate speculatively quantity and size. The trouble with number then passes down to the Old Academy. Speusippus replaces  the Forms as paradigms of existence with mathematical numbers that derive from the two primary principles of the One and multiplicity. Xenocrates, in turn, modiﬁ  es Speusippus’ principles into the Monad and the Dyad. The  Neopythagoreans mix together the ontological and mathematical meaning  of number. In this tradition, Plotinus continues the Platonic and Neopythagorean  dialogue on the dialectic between One and Many as he weaves the bound- like nature of the universe, which, like a fabric and the details of its texture, consists of unity and diversity. However, through the concept of number, he distinguishes many ( ta polla ), as innumerable diversity , from multiplicity ( to plêthos ) ,  a s  m u l t i p l i c i t y  t h a t  i s  o r d e r e d  a c c o r d i n g  t o  n u m b e r  a s  i f  n u m b e r   agglutinates the different degrees of separation from the One into the ﬁ  nite  and bondlike unity of the imaginary cosmic sphere. VI.6 addresses two core questions for the understanding of the composi- tion of the universe: What is number? What is the relationship between num- ber and multiplicity? The importance of the questions is emphasized by the concluding argument of the treatise espousing the position that number under-lies the existence of every aspect of the intelligible. As explained in VI. 6.9, n u m b e r  s u p e r s e d e s  t h e  h y p o s t a s e s  o f  S o u l  a n d  I n t e l l e c t .  T h e  o n t o l o g i c a l l y  paradigmatic role of number in the intelligible realm is imitated by the quanti-tati v e monadic n um ber that en umerates p h ysical reali ty . As a resul t, P lotin us ’ concept of number explains the universe as “unambiguously ﬁ  nite.”  1</p><div id="pagenum"><p>1. To use Lewis’ precise expression ( 1964 :98).</p></div><div id="pagenum"><p>PLOTINUS ON NUMBER 142</p></div><p id="page">Ennead VI.6 is at the heart o f P lotinian cosmology . The treatise begins  with a discussion of multiplicity in place of number, because multiplicity is  ontological expression of number as activity of substance in the kosmos noêtos. This ontological separation ( apostasis ) successively instantiates the separation  of Intellect, the descent of Soul from Intellect that enmatters physical reality. Once multiplicity reaches complete separation from the One, it turns inward and, by seeking itself, seeks its origin. Like the progression and regression of number in Moderatus’ deﬁ  nition, the two directions of multiplicity construct  a dynamic universe, centered on the principles of the outward cosmogonical unfolding of multiplicity to the phenomenal world and the inward cosmolog-ical enfolding of all elements to the One. Everything exists as a certain degree  of separation from the One substantiated by number. Thus the question of  whether multiplicity is a separation from the One contains Plotinus’ deﬁ  ni- ti o n  o f  n um b e r  i t s e l f .  M u l ti p l i ci ty  i s  th e  p h e n o m e n a l  e x p r e s s i o n  o f  n um b e r  in the composition of the universe. Without multiplicity there is no number; without number there is no multiplicity. In order to explicate the nature of number, Plotinus has to explain ﬁ  rst what multiplicity is. The beginning of VI. 6 depicts the bidirectional state in which multi- plicity exists. The initial centrifugal movement of separation from the One  reverses itself into a centripetal introspection of that which has separated from the One. In the intelligible realm, this movement is conducted accord-ing to the ontogenic participation of substantial number in the existence of Being, Intellect, and all beings. In physical reality, the separation from the One of the intelligible beings is copied by monadic number, which quanti-tatively enumerates individual things. Monadic numbers and their mathe-matical application conceal their intelligible source. As with any intelligible entity, the existence of substantial numbers is not apparent to the untrained mind but is a subject of contemplation only. T h e  m a i n  a r g u m e n t  o f  V I . 6 is that existence in the intelligible realm  is not only a degree of ontogenetic separation from the One, mediated by  number, but depends on and is a result of the constitutive ontological role of number. More speciﬁ  cally, substantial number provides a representation  o f  t h e  g e n e r a l  p r o p e r t i e s  o f  s u b s t a n c e .  W i t h  B e i n g ,  s u b s t a n t i a l  n u m b e r  i s  uniﬁ ed and thus closest to the One. With Intellect, substantial number is  moving in itself reenacting the dichotomy of the Indeﬁ  nite Dyad itself, and </p><div id="pagenum"><p>becomes ontologically separated further from the One than Being. With beings, substantial number exists in the multiplicity of beings that, facil-i t a t e d  b y  t h e  m o v i n g - i n - i t s e l f  n u m b e r  o f  I n t e l l e c t ,  h a v e  u n f o l d e d  i n t o  t h e  individual existence of beings, and constitutes the next more distant sep-aration from the One in the intelligible. Deciphering and enacting all the p r o p e r t i e s  o f  s u b s t a n t i a l  n u m b e r  i n  i t s  c o s m i c  d a n c e ,  s o u l  e n m a t t e r s  t h e m  into quantitative monadic numbers.</p></div><div id="pagenum"><p>CONCLUSION 143</p></div><p id="page">The concept of separation from the One ascribes to number and mul- tiplicity a primary role in constructing the architecture of the intelligible  realm, in which number performs the function of limit, and multiplicity enacts the Platonic and Pythagorean concept of the Unlimited. Number is the likeness of the One in the sense that it constrains multiplicity to a cer-tain limit and preserves it from slipping away into inﬁ  nity. It imitates, albeit  in an ontologically deteriorated way, the self-sufﬁ  ciency and completeness of  the One. Wallis concludes that existence in Plotinus’ hierarchy means “a frag- mentation of the unity of the One.”  2 Others have also established that num- ber fulﬁ  lls an ontological purpose in Plotinus’ hierarchy.3 Wallis’ claim that  Plotinus “never” considers multiplicity as “a valuable addition to an initial uni ty” should be revised in ligh t of VI. 6. The treatise elucidates that which  has been left unwritten in the Platonic view of number—that number is an active actuality of Being and a power of substance that builds the architec-ture of the universe according to its ontological role. 4 In other words, sub- s t a n t i a l  n u m b e r  a c t u a l i z e s  W a l l i s ’  “ f r a g m e n t a t i o n  o f  t h e  u n i t y  o f  t h e  O n e ”  by determining every form of intelligible existence. The current study also warrants the revision of Bréhier’s view that the  discussion of multiplicity in the opening chapter of the treatise does not relate to Plato’s concept of number because it does not have a ﬁ  xed number. 5 The  deﬁ nition of multiplicity as an apostasis  from the One explains that multiplic- ity originates from number, regardless of what the exact ﬁ  nite number is. As  s o o n  a s  e v e n  t h e  s l i g h t e s t  s e p a r a t i o n  o r  m o v i n g  a w a y  f r o m  t h e  O n e  o c c u r s ,  number and substance act together to procure the unfolding of multiplicity from the One in due ontological order. Existence, then, is Otherness from the One, actualized by the intelligible number. Multiplicity is separation from the One according to the ontological exigency of substantial number. 2. Wallis ( 1972:57) explains that “Plotinus’ conception of the One can  best be understood if we recall that in his view multiplicity is never a valuable  addition to an initial unity , but connotes rather a fragmentation of that unity  (VI.6.1; VI.7.8.19–22). Hence at each stage of his universe the descent into  greater multiplicity imposes fresh limits and restrictions, disperses and weakens  the power of previous stages, and creates fresh needs requiring the development  of new faculties previously unnecessary.” 3. Krämer ( 1964 :300–304 ); Charles-Saget ( 1982 :124–127); and Nikulin  (1998 :85–89). 4. Scholars traditionally study the central chapters ( 6–9) dealing with  number in the intelligible: Krämer ( 1964 :292–311); Alexandrakis ( 1998 ); Nikulin  (1998 ); with the exception of Pépin ( 1979) and Horn ( 1995b: 149–169).</p><div id="pagenum"><p>5. Bréhier ( 1963 : vol. 6 ,7).</p></div><div id="pagenum"><p>PLOTINUS ON NUMBER 144</p></div><p id="page">The seeming paradox of coexistence of Limit and Unlimited in the  nature of multiplicity and number implies that, if things can be numbered,  then they are not inﬁ  nite. For number determines the boundaries of mul- tiplicity, consequently the universe, by preserving it from “complete sepa- ration” ( pantelês apostasis ). For the one who numbers perceives objects as  inﬁ nite because numbers in physical reality can always admit another num- ber. The true existence of number, however, is not quantitative or a subject  of mathematical speculation but is an active actuality of substance ( energeia  tês ousias ). Moving in itself, substantial number provides the ability of the  Intellect to think itself and thus recognize all Forms as number, which has unfolded itself in the encompassing and thus ﬁ  nite number of the Complete  Living Being. Substantial number conducts the separation of all beings from the One at every level of the intelligible by constructing and ﬁ  lling up the  cos mi c  s p h e r e  wi th  e xi s t e n ce . 6 Th e  uni v e rs e  i s  ﬁ  nite because even monadic  number is an image of the substantial number that constitutes the outer-most layer of the cosmic sphere. The universe, like a sphere, is ﬁ  nite, with  the only difference that it is alive in the sense that the ordered multiplicity  expands in and out. The concentric composition of VI. 6 underlines introspectively the cen- tral theme of the treatise that number has an ontological and constitutive role  in the composition of the intelligible realm. Number substantiates both the downward ontogenetic and upward ontological direction of multiplicity. The universe, as a breathing sphere, unfolds and enfolds according to number. The inward and outward properties of number in the intelligible determine the inward and outward directions of multiplicity. Number is the principle and the measure of beings and matter. In this sense, substantial number is perfect and the active actuality of Being that divides substance to create all beings. As a result, number is the building block of Plotinus’ cosmos and the underlying principle for multiplicity to exist in the intelligible realm and in physical reality. The study of this book demonstrates that the subject of number should  be considered among the most important concepts for understanding Plotinus’ philosophy and therefore deserves greater scholarly attention than it has received. Plotinus adopts and adapts Platonic and Neopythagorean cosmology to place number in the foundation of the intelligible realm and the construction of the universe. He is the ﬁ  rst philosopher who fuses the  Platonic true numbers and the quantitative mathematical numbers in a con-ceptually informed relationship, as between an intelligible paradigm and its sense-perceptible image. Throughout the Enneads  and especially in Ennead VI.6, he systematically peels off the layers of mathematical and quantitative  perception from the concept of number to reveal that real number is the </p><div id="pagenum"><p>6. VI.7.12.23–30.</p></div><div id="pagenum"><p>CONCLUSION 145</p></div><p id="page">primary activity of substance, which orders the unfolding of the universe  from its absolute source into a ﬁ  nite multiplicity. The concept of number is the troublemaker in the history of Platonism.  It separated the followers of Plato and Aristotle into two camps for gen-erations. For Plotinus, however, the concept becomes the peacemaker that r e c o n c i l e s  t h e  c a m p s .  T h e  i m p o r t a n c e  o f  t h i s  r e c o n c i l i a t i o n  i s  c e n t r a l  t o  Plotinus’ philosophical system because it not only uses Aristotle to defend  Plato from Aristotle himself but brings to light Plotinus’ major proof that  the universe is ﬁ  nite. For him, as for his Platonic and Neopythagorean pre-</p><div id="pagenum"><p>decessors, the universe has meaning, enciphered by number. In this light, Plotinus’ concept of number is the fundamental link between the number theories of the Neopythagoreans and the later Neoplatonists.</p></div><div id="pagenum"><p>This page intentionally left blank This page intentionally left blank </p></div><p id="page"></p><div id="pagenum"><p>This page intentionally left blank This page intentionally left blank </p></div><div id="pagenum"><p>147The following bibliography includes items to which I have referred in the </p></div><p id="page">text and items that I have found useful for understanding the subject but that are not referred to in the text.
