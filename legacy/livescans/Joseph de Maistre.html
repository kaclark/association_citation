    <p>Here is how I came to talk to you about prayer. Since every evil is a punishment, it follows that no evil can be regarded as necessary, because it could have been prevented. On this point, as on so many others, the temporal order is the image of a higher order. Punishments being made necessary only by crimes, and every crime being the act of a free will, it follows that every punishment could have been prevented, since the crime need not have been committed. I would add that after it has been committed, the punishment can still be prevented in two ways; first, the merits of the guilty person, or even those of his ancestors, can balance out his fault; and second, his fervent supplications, or those of his friends, can disarm the sovereign. pg 105 St.Petersburg Dialouges</p>
    
    <p>Moreover do not let yourself be seduced by what modern theologians say about the immensity of God, our littleness, and the foolishness that we commit in wanting to judge him according to ourselves, fine phrases that tend not to exalt God but to degrade man. pg 106 St.Petersburg Dialouges</p>
    
    <p>of believing in invariable laws of nature. This system offers seductive appearances, yet it leads directly to the decline of prayer, that is to say, to the death of the spiritual life, for prayer is the respiration of the soul, as was said, I believe, by M. de Saint-Martin. He who no longer prays no longer lives. No religion without prayer, said Voltaire, whom you have just cited. Nothing is more obvious, and it necessarily follows, No prayer, no religion. This is just about the state to which we are reduced. Since men have never prayed except by virtue of a revealed religion (or one recognized as such), in the measure that they have approached deism, which is and can do nothing, they have ceased to pray, and now you see them bent towards the earth, uniquely occupied with physical laws and studies, and no longer having the least inkling of their natural dignity. pg 112 St.Petersburg Dialouges</p>

    <p>"Several critics have noted the debt the great tradition of 20th century French
sociology owes to de Maistre and de Bonald. Lacan in his turn was heavily indebted to this tradition. Lacan was also educated in the same Catholic theological tradition that informs de Maistre’s polemics. Perhaps it should not surprise us then how many of de Maistre’s formulations provide striking anticipations of Lacan’s (and Freud’s) teachings, as we will see as we proceed. Humans are creatures who ‘do not know what they want,’ de Maistre contends: ‘[man] wants what he does not want; he does not want what he wants; he wants to want.’ (at Berlin, 2005: 12) Man’s conscious intentionality is similarly in no measure the final arbiter of the sense or effects of his actions." ibid</p>
    
    <p>"For de Maistre as for the entire reactionary tradition, human reason proceeds under the sign of human vanity, and our wilful, sinful, fallen ambition to challenge and supplant the creator." ibid</p>
    
    <p>"Neither de Maistre nor de Bonald write the free-ranging, experientially based essays of a Burke or a Montaigne. Their medium is the formal theoretical ‘Study’, ‘Essay’, ‘Consideration’ or treatise, reflecting their heritage in medieval Catholic scholasticism. De Maistre’s devastating critique of Rousseau’s notion of the ‘state of nature’, for instance, is argued in the terms of what looks like an orthodox Thomistic-scholastic view of creation: one for which each thing in nature has a telos or purpose, so its natural ‘work’ and excellence is to fulfil this purpose. If it strays to far from this work, it will destroy itself. To look as Rousseau does to man in his primitive beginnings as a guide for political theory, de Maistre argues, is to put the cart before the horse. It is like trying to judge the nature of a man by assessing a child. Politics ought to be about achieving the highest ends of men. These presuppose government and political life in common. To imagine a human being, a priori, devoid of his social relations is not to imagine a human being at all. It is certainly not to provide sound bases for good political theory. (De Maistre, 1884: I.II; II.IV)" ibid</p>
    
    <p>"De Maistre contends that nations, like individuals, have their own ‘mind’, ‘soul’, or sometimes ‘genius’. (De Maistre, 1884: I.IV) These expressions are for him more than metaphorical. Each nation’s soul is enigmatic and singular. Accordingly, de Maistre concedes in his ‘Study’ the broadly Aristotelian point that the best practicable regime will differ from place to place, although none can stray too far from monarchy and hope to endure. The other way de Maistre describes this position, one which Carl Schmitt later takes on, is to claim that each nation has its own particular ‘constitution’ or ‘way of life’ (De Maiste, 1884: I.IV)." ibid</p>
    
    <p>Sometimes, De Maistre allows that the modern sciences have their own limited place and use (1884: I.XII)—although more often he does not concede this much. Yet De Maistre cannot heap enough disgust on Locke, Condillac, Voltaire and the philosophes who presume to bring reason to decide on normative and political questions. At stake in his work is a reactionary radicalisation of a motif present also in Luther, Hamann, or Burke, that reason is by its nature analytic. It can only divide, destroy, or as we might say today, ‘deconstruct’. ((eg) De Maistre, 1884: I.VII-X) It cannot put the pieces back together again, and hold them there. For this reason, De Maistre claims to be able to prove the arch-reactionary claim that all political constitutions have had divine origins— i.e. since human reason and will could not have created them, and there is for him no possible tertium datur:

As no nation has been able to give itself the character and position that fit it to a
particular government, all have been agreed ... in accepting this truth ... [and]
believing that the Divinity had intervened directly in the institution of their particular
sovereignties ... (De Maistre, 1884: II. IV)

Government is a true religion; it has its dogmas, its mysteries, its priests—to
submit it to individual discussion is to destroy it. (1884: I.XI)</p>
    
    <p>Now: intriguingly, the link Žižek’s Lacanian theory allows him to make between language and politics, and the sovereign fiat (S1) and naming, is not lost on de Maistre. One difference between the European conservatism that emerged in response to the French Revolution and its British cousin is the characteristic emphasis de Maistre, de Bonald, and figures like Herder in Germany placed on language. In the first instance, the reactionaries’ interest is in language as the bearer of the national mind, soul, or constitution: the slowly-evolving, subconscious repository of its history and particular ‘way of life’. Hence, for instance, de Maistre decries the mixing of tongues in ‘The Essay on the Generative Principle of Political Constitutions’ as a sure sign of the declining vitality of a people. Yet de Bonald’s and de Maistre’s interest in language goes deeper than that. Indeed, it lies at the heart of their political interventions. De Maistre aligns the sovereign’s act of fiat or decision, which lays down the law, with the power to name things in the world. The fault he finds in the philosophes’ work is hence ontological, as much as it is political. The moderns’ belief that they could found political constitutions from theory or through public democratic assembly is the corollary of the same erroneous pretension in their thinking concerning language:

[Man] has believed that it was himself who invented languages; while again it belongs to him only to see that every human language is learned and never invented, that no imaginable hypothesis within the circle of human power, can explain, with the least appearance of probability, either the formation or the diversity of languages ... (De Maistre, 2002: xlvii)</p>
    
    <p>De Maistre’s critical targets are the accounts of language, already emergent in the European enlightenment, which pointed towards the arbitrary or conventional nature of linguistic signs: the position of structuralism after de Saussure in the 20th century. ibid</p>
    
    <p>The Derridean move to make at this point would be to accuse de Maistre, alongside all philosophers since Plato, of giving way to an alleged ‘phonocentric’ prioritisation of living speech over writing’s dead letter. As Eco concludes, the final stake of all de Maistre’s prognostications is the myth of a pure origin, which Derrida also targets: ‘to establish a double equation between Truth and Origin and
between Origin and Language.’ (Eco, 1998: 115) God, de Maistre insists, at first only spoke directly to the Hebrews, because he could see the purity of their hearts. The religion of the book came only later, when the Hebrews had become corrupted. Similarly, says de Maistre—dicing directly now with heresy—other ancient peoples had occult wisdom lost to us today:

As far as it is possible to observe the sciences of the primitive peoples despite the
enormous distance, we see it always free, independent; it does not so much walk
as fly, and in all its bearings there is something aerial and supernatural. It flings its
hair to the wind, beneath an Oriental miter. The efod covers its bosom; it looks
only to the sky; and its scornful foot seems only to touch the earth to detach itself
from it. Although this primitive science never asked anything of anyone, and relied
on no human support, we still have proof that it possessed the most rare kinds of
knowledge. (in Eco, 1998: 101)

A Lacanian reading of this de Maistrean motif points in a different direction than
the deconstructionists’. It would note, first of all, the telltale agitation that characterises de Maistre’s attacks on writing and modern philosophy more broadly—‘ink-stained and out of breath.’ (at Eco, 1998: 101) These attacks typically equate the act of writing, directly, with the biological act of insemination. Writing is germination’s kind of black double or negation: ‘if [a man] possessed the true germs of thought he would not indulge the thought that with a little black liquid and a pen he could cause to germinate in the world ...’ (2002: xix)</p>
    
    <p>Underlying the ‘germinating,’ law-making S1 in the discourse of de Maistre, then, we uncover no primordial lack, trauma, or divided subject ($). The reactionaries’ thought does not finally move in the orbit of the discourse of the master, but only in its semblance. In the will and voice of the divine, we are rather in the presence of a full, sustaining phallic Jouissance. And here is the rub. De Maistre’s God adjudicates over all the unintended effects of our words and actions, like the Lacanian Other. Yet He is not for that reason the symbolic Other, in whose differential play and temporality, contingency would always have a place and a role. There can be no Nachtraglichkeit (the retrospective conferral of meaning or necessity on previously ‘floating’ signifiers) in de Maistre’s thinking. The reason is that everything has been determined in advance. ‘In a word, the name of every being expresses what it is, and in this matter there is nothing arbitrary,’ de Maiste intones. ibid</p>
    
    <p>Our point here however is that De Maistre’s Other (God) is an Other who would exist in the Real, potent beyond all lack and contingency. [quote] ‘Names have
then [sic.] nothing arbitrary and originate like all other things more or less immediately in God ...’(De Maistre, 2002: lii) De Maistre’s God’s is the hand that would inscrutably direct all the play and evolution of natural languages. It is His phallic will that would have ‘germinated’ all things, although we mortals only see through a glass darkly the meanings of our acts. Because of this, and of our fallen nature, human beings are particularly inclined to see ourselves as free and independent, as if there were chance and contingency in the world. Yet such a thought, de Maistre comments, is as plausible ‘as if the trowel should believe itself the architect’ (2002: x), just because it plies the mortar. The truth is different. It is that ‘man is a free intelligent, and noble being, without doubt; but he is not less an instrument of god, according to the happy expression of Plutarch, in a beautiful passage which here introduces itself of its own accord [sic.].’</p>
    
    <p>Isaiah Berlin notes, in his acerbic essay on de Maistre, that while de Maistre fascinated people of all political stripes (Napoleon tried to arrange a meeting), he always received a frosty reception from Europe’s older-style legitimists. In fact only a third generation aristocrat, the young de Maistre was educated a mason, before turning to the One True Church. His writings are dotted with apologies to the Church for his entertaining various frankly gnostic speculations. One of the ancient beliefs whose very universality amongst primitive peoples allegedly attests to its transcendent Truth, de Maistre for instance maintains in his essay ‘Enlightenment on Sacrifice’, is that human beings have an irresistable desire for self-immolation. This is why soldiers, for instance, go so willingly to kill others, and face their own deaths. (cf. Berlin, 2005: 10-11) The third chapter of the ‘Considerations of France’, similarly, is devoted to considering the very unchristian theme of ‘The Violent Destruction of Humanity.’ Read after the twentieth century, De Maistre’s proximity to the ontology of the later Freud, with its central postulate of a universal death drive, cannot be missed in these texts. To cite a very famous passage from the ‘Seventh Dialogue’ of the Soirees, in which de Maistre leaves orthodox Thomism far behind:

In the whole vast domain of living nature there reigns an open violence, a kind of
prescriptive fury which arms all the creatures to their common doom. As soon as
you leave the inanimate kingdom, you find the decree of violent death inscribed on
the very frontiers of life. You feel it already in the vegetable kingdom ... how many
plants die, and how many are killed. But from the moment you enter the animal
kingdom, this law is suddenly in the most dreadful evidence. A power of violence
at once hidden and palpable ... has in each species appointed a certain number of
animals to devour the others ... there is no instant of time when one creature is not
being devoured by another. Over all these numerous races of animals man is
placed, and his destructive hand spares nothing that lives ... and who in all of this
will exterminate He who exterminates all the others? Himself. It is man who is
charged with the slaughter of man ... thus is accomplished the great law of the
violent destruction of living creatures ... (in Berlin, 2005: 5-6)

Human history, de Maistre maintains in this remarkable chapter, is a ‘long history of massacres.’ ‘Through this primary cause [of war] and all the others connected with it, the spilling of blood has never ceased on earth,’ de Maistre comments.</p>
    
    <p>III) However, there is this much good news: ‘... the true fruits of human nature
—the arts, sciences, great enterprises, noble ideas, manly virtues—spring above all from the state of war.’ (1796: ch. III) Seen in the light of this ‘great law of ... violent destruction’, we are soon led to question de Maistre’s horror at the violence of the French revolution, or to query in what terms this horror can be signified by him. In fact, de Maistre’s central argument in the ’Considerations’ is something you won’t find in Burke, or in any other major readers of the French revolution—except, ironically, Hegel. The French Revolution is not the traumatic intrusion of the Real of contingency in the fabric of human affairs, however appalling its various acts. On the contrary, if the revolution took on such a violent life of its own, devouring its own children, it was because it was willed in advance by Providence or God:

How indeed have these remarkable events that have baffled all human foresight
come about in one day? In truth, there is a temptation to believe that political
revolution is only the secondary object of the great plan which is developing before
our eyes with such terrible majesty. (De Maistre, 1796: ch. II)

The revolution, and all its slaughter, are for de Maistre a kind of collective sacrifice to His Other who does not lack, de Maistre’s God. This God—for whom we have seen even all the smallest of our names cannot be changed without Him predetermining it—is punishing France through the revolution. He is making the French an example unto others. The sin is impiety. And the revolution is less the crime, than an attempt at reparation.</p>
    
    <p>De Maistre’s God, in short, like the Nature presented to us by several of de Sade’s most philosophical characters (see anon), desires violence. It is not for nothing that De Maistre enthuses at the ‘genius’ of the ancient Greeks, in whose tragedies nature is named as philomata [loving, or thirsting for blood].’ (at Eco, 1998: 102)</p>
    
    <p>The Žižekian-Lacanian point to be made here, then, is that however heretically
cruel de Maistre’s blood-thirsty ontology appears, it is ontologically speaking not cruel enough. In a manner which recalls the clinic (or boudoir) of sadism, when de Maistre dons his prophetic hat in the ‘Considerations’, he disavows his own position as a divided subject ($), in order to observe it from a distance in the sufferings of the French beneath the ‘invisible hand’ of his bloodthirsty Providential deity. The ethical issue, as Žižek argues in ‘Kant with (or against) de Sade’, is that such a sadistic subject position does not fully or ‘coldly’ enough bracket the ‘pathological’ dimension of human feelings whose ‘beyond’ our desire would point us toward. De Maistre hence revealingly confesses in the ‘Considerations’ that his observations are not as objective or despairing as we might imagine. Au contraire, he confesses that [quote]: ‘it is sweet [doux] to fathom the design of the Godhead in the midst of general cataclysm’ (at Hirschmann, 1991: 36): and he also tells us frankly of his ‘admiration’ for the ‘secret force which mocks human intentions’. We hardly need to point out that this ‘sweet’ pleasure at watching the revolution destroy the lives of thousands is a pure exemplification of what Lacanians call Jouissance: a painful and even shameful enjoyment in what is usually off-limits to
speaking subjects as such.</p>
    
    <p>This means: the sadistic agent (a) bombards his/her victims with inconsistent and/or painful demands in order to cruelly divide them ($) so they manifest their castration, lack, or desire. Far from being a position of sovereign mastery, as Sartre for one supposes, the truth sustaining the agent’s position however is his abject dependency upon a cruel Other (A). This is an Other, like de Maistre’s stern deity, who is supposed to enjoy the spectacle. The agent, meanwhile, objectifies himself in the name of this Other (hence the ‘a’ for object in the top left hand), reducing himself to the object-instrument of this malevolent Other’s Jouissance. As Žižek notes, the Lacanian view of the sadistic position thus strikingly inverts the popular understanding of the pervert as the ultimate rebel—s/he who acts out what the rest of us can only dream about. As Lacan comments in ‘Kant with Sade’ in Ecrits:

Sade ... stopped at the point where desire and the law became bound up with
each other [se noue]. / If something in him lets itself remain tied to the law in order
to take the opportunity, mentioned by Saint Paul, to become inordinately sinful,
who would cast the first stone? But Sade went no further. / It is not simply that the
flesh is weak, as it is for each of us; it is that the spirit is not willing not to be
deluded. [Sade’s] apology for crime merely impels him to an oblique acceptance of
the Law. The Supreme Being [as for instance the Nature of Pius VI] is restored in
Evil Action [le Maléfice]. (Lacan, 2006, 667/790)</p>
    
    <p>‘it is one of those evils that play a part in an order in which everything is violent and against nature and which has its compensations.’ (De Maistre, 1796: ch. III) Indeed, some of them are sweet. Faced with the imminent collapse of the Other whose unsullied continuity the Anglophone conservatives celebrate, we hence propose, the elementary move of the reactionary legitimists is to accept the ‘lamentable’ need to suspend ordinary morality in order to save the Other. It
is not the reinvigoration of the discourse of the master that is in play; it is the sadists’ simulation of the inaugurating act that might re-establish the lost law, played out against the background of a vindictive certainty that one has God on one’s side. The realpolitical implications of this teaching, when coupled with their defence of the sovereign as absolute by definition, should not escape us. The reactionary position, if our diagnosis of its structuring sadism holds, will always be fatally drawn to prescribe the sacrifice of others. These others, moreover, can be treated with all the indifference with which de Sade’s heroes multiply their beautiful, preferably innocent victims in the latter’s repetitive oeuvre. As de Maistre concedes, showing us the measure of his all-too-human feelings: ‘No doubt there are innocent people amongst the unfortunates, but they are far fewer than are commonly imagined.’ (De Maistre, 1796: ch. II)</p>
    
    <p>De Maistre and company radicalise the conservative critique of modern reason: from non-rationalism into virulent irrationalism. Exiles from their homelands, they do not write, like Burke did, some one hundred years after a constitutional monarchy, and the ascendancy of parliament, had been peaceably installed. Indeed, for them parliamentary government stands condemned of the decadent view that reason alone can create ideals and institutions of lasting value.</p>
    
    <p>For de Maistre, put simply, the symbolic function is not sufficient, by itself, to ground social order. Without a basis in the Real of an active Divine Other, promises are ‘so many words’, as we say. The Other, its violent bases denuded by the revolution, must instead be saved from human wickedness and pride.</p>
    
    <p>More than this, the darker truth is that God loves sacrifice: since His creation is one in which, as de Maistre says, ‘an order of things in which everything is violent and against nature.’ (De Maistre 1796: ch. III)</p>
    
    <p>As we have seen, de Maistre plumbs the violent depths of order with a kind of gleeful fascination which makes Machiavelli’s Il Princip seem Saintly. Far from a humble, divided subject who, aware of his finitude, would advocate slow and steady political change, de Maistre writes with a kind of fearful certainty. The news he has to report about the French revolution is not good news. But de Maistre reports it bloodily all the same, confident that he is but His, God’s, servant, conveying this news to lesser men. In de Maistre’s case, we thus can observe the truth in Žižek’s observation about the false humility of positions, like de Maistre’s, which claim to but humbly convey a higher will. The question to ask here is first of all: how do you know enough about this transcendent Other to be able to claim to ‘humbly’ serve him?</p>
    
    <p>The discursive structure of the reactionaries’ ‘conservatism’, in fact, is not ‘conservative’ at all. It is structurally sadistic, rather than a re-instantiation or defence of the position of the classical master. In all politics, especially the most violent, de Maistre thus will repeat, we are but the instruments of the divine will. And this will shalt be done, even if this involves the evil massacre of innocents. As de Maistre concludes his horrified-fascinated hymn to the executioner in the Soirees, with which we began:

He sits down to table, and he eats. He goes to bed and he sleeps. And on the next
day, when he wakes, he thinks of something totally different from what he did the
day before. Is he a man? Yes. God receives him in his temples, and allows him
to pray. He is not a criminal. Nevertheless no tongue dare declare that he is
virtuous, that he is an honest man, that he is estimable. No moral praise is
appropriate to him, for everyone else is assumed to have relations with human
beings: he has none. And yet all greatness, all power, all subordination rest on the
executioner. He is the terror and he is the bond of human association. Remove
this mysterious agent from the world, and in an instant order yields to chaos:
thrones fall, society disappears. God, who has created sovereignty, has also
made punishment; he has fixed the earth upon these two poles: ‘for Jehovah is
master of the twin poles and upon them he maketh turn the world’ ... (at Berlin,
2005: 19-20)</p>

Do you think that one can desire desire?
St.Petersburg Dialogues pg 159</p>
    
    <p>I have never attended one of these holy ceremonies intended to avoid the scourges of heaven or to solicit its favours without asking myself with a real terror: In the midst of these pretentious hymns and august rites, how many among this assembled crowd are there who, by their faith and by their works, have the right to pray, and who have a well-founded hope of praying efficaciously? How many are there who are really praying? This one is thinking of his business, that one of his pleasures, a third is preoccupied with the music; the least guilty perhaps is the one who yawns without knowing where he is. So again, how many of those present are really praying, and how many merit a response?

The more you think about it, the more you will be convinced that there is nothing as difficult as offering up a genuine prayer.
St.Petersburg Dialogues pg 160</p>
    
    <p>The Count
As soon as man bases himself on his reason, he ceases to pray; so that he has always confessed, without noticing it, that of himself he does not know that he must ask or how he must pray or even precisely to what he must address himself.

In vain therefore does the deist set out for us the most beautiful theories on the existence and attributes of God; without telling him (which is nevertheless incontestable) that he got these from his catechism, we will always have the right to say to him like Joas: YOU DO NOT PRAY.

Locke would first have taught you that we have negative names that stand directly for positive ideas, which you will readily believe. You will learn subsequently that
a negative idea is nothing other than a positive idea, plus that of the absence of something, as he immediately demonstrates for you by the idea of silence. In effect, what is silence? It is noise, PLUS, the absence of noise.

And what is NOTHING? (This is important, for this is the most general expression of negative ideas.) Locke responds with a profundity that cannot be too highly exalted: It is the idea of the thing, to which one simply adds to be sure, that of the absence of the thing.
St.Petersburg Dialogues pg 167</p>
    
    <p>Liberty is the power to do. How can this be? Does it mean that a man imprisoned and enchained does not have the power, without acting, of making himself guilty of all sorts of crimes? He has only to will them. On his point, Ovid speaks like the Gospels: Qui, quia non licuit, nonfacit, ille facit [He who does not do it because it is illegal, (really) is doing it]. If then liberty is not the power to do, it can only be the power to will; but the power to will is the will itself, and to ask if the will can will, is to ask if perception has the power to perceive, if reason has the power to reason, which is to ask if a circle is a circle, a triangle a triangle, etc. - in a word to ask if an essence is an essence.

So they pounced upon Locke's unfortunate Essay, and cherished it with an
ardour that one can scarcely understand unless one pays particular attention. I remember that I was once shocked by seeing one of the most hardened atheists who has perhaps ever existed recommending to young people an edition of Locke abridged, that is to say concentrated, by an Italian writer who should have been acting in a way more in keeping with his vocation. Read him, he told them with enthusiasm, read him and learn him by heart', he would have wanted, as Madame de Sevigne said, to give him to them with their soup?

There is a sure rule for judging books just as there is for judging men: it is enough to know by whom they are loved and by whom they are hated. This rule never fails, and I have already proposed it to you with respect to Bacon. As soon as you see a book made popular by the encyclopedists, translated by an atheist, and unstintingly praised by the past century's flood of philosophers, you can be sure, without further examination, that its philosophy is false and dangerous, at least in its general thrust.
St.Petersburg Dialogues pg 190</p>
    
    <p>If Locke, who was a very honest man, returned to the world, he would weep bitterly to see how his errors, sharpened by French methods, have become the shame and misfortune of an entire generation. Do you not see that God has proscribed this vile philosophy, and that it has even pleased him to make the anathema visible? Look through all the books of its devotees; you will not find there a single line whose good taste and virtue are worth remembering. This philosophy is the death of all religion, of all delicate feelings, of all sublime enthusiasm; every father of a family especially must be clearly warned that in receiving it under his roof, he is really doing all that he could do to chase out life, since no warmth can survive its glacial breath.

ibid pg 191</p>
    
    <p>The day will come, and perhaps it is not far off, when Locke will be unanimously placed among those writers who have done the most harm to men. However, despite all the reproaches I have made against him, I have touched on only part of his errors, and perhaps the least. After having laid the foundations of a philosophy as false as it is dangerous, his deadly mind turned towards politics with a no less deplorable result. He spoke about the origin of the laws as badly as about the origin of ideas; and on this point he again laid down principles whose consequences we are now seeing. These terrible seeds would perhaps have withered in silence in the coldness of his style, but nurtured in the hot houses of Paris, they produced the revolutionary monster that has devoured Europe.
St.Petersburg Dialogue pg 192-193</p>
    
    <p>I nevertheless profess my veneration for Locke's moral character. However I still deplore the influence of his bad principle on the best minds. It is this principle unfortunately that has reigned in Europe for three centuries, it is this principle that denies everything, that overturns everything, that protests against everything. NO is written on the brazen brow of this principle. This is the real title of Locke's book, which in turn can be considered as the preface of all eighteenth-century philosophy, which is totally negative and in consequence null. Read the Essay, on every page you will sense that Locke only wrote to contradict received ideas, and especially to humiliate an authority that shocked him immeasurably.

    <p>He bore a grudge against a certain kind of people who, affecting to be masters and teachers, and hoping to govern others more easily, enlisted the aid of blind credulity to make the others SWALLOW innate principles that must not be questioned.

    <p>In any case, gentlemen, no matter what we say, Locke's authority will be difficult to overturn so long as it supported by the great powers. In twenty French works of the last century I have read: Locke and Newtonl Such is the privilege of great nations;

    <p>Yet there is in man, despite his immense degradation, an element of love drawing him towards his fellowmen; compassion is as natural to him as breathing. By what inconceivable magic is he always ready, at the first beat of the drum, to cast off this sacred character and to be off without resistance, often even with a certain elation (which also has its own peculiar character), to blow to pieces on the battlefield a brother who has never offended him, and who on his side advances to do the same thing to him if he can?

    <p>I have often had a vision that I would like to share with you. I imagine that a stranger to our planet comes here for some sufficient reason, and talks to one of us about the order that reigns in this world. Among the curious things that are recounted to him, he is told that corruption and vices, about which he has been fully informed, in certain circumstances require men to die by the hand of men, and that we restrict this right to kill legally to the executioner and to the soldier. He will also be told: "The first brings death to convicted and condemned criminals, and these executions are so rare fortunately, that one of these ministers of death suffices for each province. As for soldiers, there are never enough of them for they kill without restraint, and they always kill honest men. Of these two professional killers, the soldier and the executioner, the one is greatly honoured, and has always been so honoured among the peoples that up to the present have inhabited this planet to which you have come. The other, on the contrary, has just as generally been declared infamous. Can you guess on which one the condemnation falls?"

    <p>The Romans, who were at once the most sensitive and the most warlike people in antiquity, came up with a singular idea with respect to simple correction in military discipline. Believing that there could be no discipline without a stick, and nevertheless not wanting to debase either the one who strikes or the one who is struck, they thought of consecrating military beatings in a certain way. For this purpose they chose the wood that was the most useless for anything else, the vine branch, and designated it uniquely for the punishment of soldiers. The vine branch in the hand of the centurion was the sign of his authority and the instrument of non-capital corporal penalty acknowledged by the law. However no non-military person could be struck with a vine branch, and no other wood other than that of the vine could be used to strike a soldier. I don't know why some similar idea has never occurred to a modern sovereign. punishment.

    <p>"The savage sees our arts, laws, sciences, luxuries, pleasures of every kind, and especially our superiority, from which he cannot hide and yet which would excite some desires in hearts that were capable of it; but all this does not even tempt him, and continually he returns to his fellows."
St.Petersburg Dialogue pg 210</p>
    
    <p>In the vast domain of living things, there reigns an obvious violence, a kind of prescribed rage that arms all creatures to their common doom. As soon as you leave the inanimate kingdom, you find the decree of violent death written on the very frontiers of life.
St.Petersburg Dialogues pg 216</p>
    
    <p>A power at once hidden and palpable shows itself continually occupied in demonstrating the principle of life by violent means. In each great division of the animal kingdom, it has chosen a certain number of animals charged with devouring the others; thus, there are insects of prey, birds of prey, fish of prey, and quadrupeds of prey. There is no instant of time when some living thing is not being devoured by another.
St.Petersburg Dialogues pg 216</p>
    
    <p>Above all these numerous animal species is placed man, whose destructive hand spares nothing that lives. He kills to nourish himself, he kills to clothe himself, he kills to adorn himself, he kills to attack, he kills to defend himself, he kills to instruct himself, he kills to amuse himself, he kills to kill: a superb and terrible king, he needs everything and nothing resists him. 
St.Petersburg Dialogues pg 216</p>
    
    <p>Yet who will exterminate him who exterminates everything else? Man! It is man himself who is charged with slaughtering man. But how can he accomplish this law, he who is a moral and merciful being, who is born to love, who weeps for others as for himself, who finds pleasure in weeping and who even invents fictions to make himself weep, and finally, to whom it has been said that whoever sheds blood unjustly, by man shall his blood be shed. It is war that accomplishes the decree. Do you not hear the earth itself crying out and demanding blood? The blood of animals does not satisfy it, nor even that of criminals spilled by the sword of the law. If human justice struck down all criminals, there would be no war, but it can catch only a few of them, and often it even spares them, without suspecting that this cruel humanity contributes to the necessity of war, especially if at the same time, another blindness no less stupid and no less blind works to extinguish atonement in the world. The earth did not cry out in vain; war breaks out. Man, suddenly seized by a divine fury foreign to both hatred and anger, goes to the battlefield without knowing what he intends nor even what he is doing. How can this horrible enigma be explained?
St.Petersburg Dialogues pg 216-217</p>
    
    <p>"The divine spirit, which has particularly blessed Europe, has even mitigated the scourge of eternal justice, and European war will always have a special place in annals of the world. Undoubtedly Europeans killed, burned, ravaged, and even, if you wish, committed thousands of useless crimes; but nevertheless they began war in the month of May and ended it in the month of December; they slept under canvas; soldiers fought only soldiers."
St.Petersburg Dialogue pg 214</p>
    
    <p>"If you look closely at war, never will Christianity appear more sublime, more worthy of divinity, and better suited for men. Moreover, when you said legions of atheists, you did not mean it literally; nevertheless suppose these legions to be as bad as they could be, do you know how they could be defeated most easily? It would be by opposing to them the principle diametrically opposed to that by which they are constituted. You can be sure that legions of atheists could not stand against burning legions."

    <p>"but what the most abominable tyrant, the most insolent butcher of human flesh, will never hear is: We no longer want to serve you. A revolt on the battlefield, an agreement to unite to repudiate a tyrant, is an unheard-of phenomena. Nothing can resist the force that drags men into combat; an innocent murderer, a passive instrument in a formidable hand: he plunges headfirst into the abyss he has dug for himself; he bestows and receives death without suspecting that he himself prepared it."
St.Petersburg Dialogues pg 217</p>
    
    <p>"Thus, from the maggot up to man, the universal law of the violent destruction of living things is unceasingly fulfilled. The entire earth, perpetually steeped in blood, is nothing but an immense altar on which every living thing must be immolated without end, without restraint, without respite, until the consummation of the world, until the extinction of evil, until the death of death."
St.Petersburg Dialogues pg 217</p>
    
    <p>"But the anathema must strike down man most directly and most visibly: the exterminating angel circles this unhappy globe like the sun, and allows one nation a respite only to strike down others. When crimes, and especially crimes of a certain kind, accumulate to a designated point, the angel relentlessly quickens its tireless flight. Like a rapidly turning burning torch, the immense speed of his movement allows him to be simultaneously present everywhere in his formidable orbit. He strikes all the peoples of the earth at the same time. At other times, a minister of a precise and infallible vengeance, he pursues particular nations and bathes them in blood. Do not expect them to make any effort to escape or alleviate their sentence. It is as if we saw these great criminals, enlightened by their consciences, requesting the punishment and accepting it for the sake of their atonement. So long as they have any blood left they will come to offer it, and soon a sparse youth will get used to telling of these devastating wars caused by the crimes of their fathers.

War is therefore divine in itself, since it is a law of the world."
St.Petersburg Dialogues pg 218</p>
    
    <p>War is divine in its results, which absolutely escape the speculations of human reason, since they can be totally different for two different nations, even though the war appears to have affected them both equally. There are wars that degrade nations, and degrade them for centuries; others exalt them, perfect them in all sorts of ways, and even soon replace momentary losses by a visible increase in population, which is something quite extraordinary. History often shows us the spectacle of a rich and growing population in the midst of the most murderous battles.

    <p>A coalition between several sovereigns, based on a pure and disinterested morality, would be a miracle. God, who owes miracles to no one, and who never works them needlessly, uses two very simple means to re-establish political equilibrium: sometimes the giant overreaches itself, and sometimes a very inferior power puts a tiny obstacle in the giant's way, something imperceptible that subsequently grows in an unaccountable way until it becomes insurmountable, just as a small branch, stuck in the current of a river, can in the end produce a blockage that diverts it. pg220</p>
    
    <p>Four centuries before our era, geese saved the [Roman] Capitol; nine centuries into our era, under the Emperor Arnoulf, Rome was taken by a hare.x I doubt whether the one or the other counted on such allies or feared such enemies. History is full of inconceivable events that disconcerted the finest speculations. pg220</p>
    
    <p>It is imagination that loses battles. pg222</p>
    
    <p>The more God seems terrible to us, the more we must redouble our  religious fear of him, the more ardent and indefatigable our prayers must  be, since nothing tells us that his goodness will make up for them. The  proof of God's existence preceding that of his attributes, we know that he  is before knowing what he is', and we can never know completely what he  is. So here we are, placed in an empire whose sovereign has published once  and for all the laws that rule everything. These laws in general bear the  stamp of wisdom and even a striking goodness; nevertheless some of them  (I assume for the moment) appear hard, even unjust, if you like. This being  the case, I ask all the discontented, what are we to do? Leave the empire,  perhaps? Impossible, it is everywhere and there is nothing outside it.  .Complain, take offence, write against the sovereign? This will result in  being punished or put to death. There is no better course to take than that  of resignation and respect, I will even say of love, for as we start from the  supposition that the master exists and that it is absolutely necessary to serve  him, is it not better (whatever he is) to serve him with love than without? pg 259</p>
