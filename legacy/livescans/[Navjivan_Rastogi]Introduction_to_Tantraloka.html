    <p>The Tantraloka happens to be the only major 'original' work of Ahhinava while his all other important works come to us in the form of a commentary on some earlier valuable text. pg1</p>
    
    <p>it came to be regarded as the most representative text of Trika system. Ksemaraja, the illustrious pupil of Abhinavagupta, talks of two characteristics of the text. One, it was composed in the state of Absolutic trance and other, it is a key to the secrets of entire agamic literature pg1-2</p>
    
    <p>Abhinavagupta invariably describes the Tantraloka as a detailed treatise and asks the author to turn for detailed dis-cussion of the problem to the latter which incorpo-rates all the prescriptive and negative injunctions emanating not only from Vedic but from Saiva, Tan-tra and Trika sources also. pg2</p>
    
    <p>The fourth and the final approach consists in Abhi-nava's contemplation of the Tanraloka as a full scale Stuti (prayer hymn). pg11</p>
    
    <p>In his eyes the entire subject matter of the Tantraloka acquires meaning when it leads one to attain Siva-hood owing to His grace alone. The Tantraloka out-lines the path and procedure to invoke such divine grace and once it is attained the clouds of nescient doubts disappear and one shines in one's pristine splendour. Such an approach lends credence to the views of many a modern scholar who takes Kashmir Saivism as theology or transcendental theology hop-ing to reach and realize the personalistic Godhead and not as a pure metaphysics concentrating on an abstract Absolute. pg11-12</p>
    
    <p>The fundamental aim is the same as that of his philosophical discipline in general. It is the achie-vement of Bhairavahood i.e., the divination of the mundane. Abhinava proudly declares that one who constantly practises all the tenets of thirtyseven Ah-nikas is oneself transformed into Bhairava, the Abso-lute pg12</p>
    
    <p>Abhinava is never tired of reiterating his preferences. He says that the original commitment of the Tantraloka is to understand the nature of Absolute Awareness. pg12</p>
    
    <p>Abhinava finds the transcendental Godhead as occupying the central focus of the Tantraloka. It is descent of His grace (Saktipata) that alone constitutes the driving force for the aspirant's movements and it is why the problems of bondage and emancipation assume a kind of primacy over other issues. pg13</p>
    
    <p>Abhinava goes on positing that the basic purpose of the Tantraloka is inculcation of the 'intuitive awareness' (Pratibha-samvitti) which once thoroughly inculcated trans-forms the discursive perspective of mankind into the unitive one pg13</p>
    
    <p>This brings us to another objective of Abhinava in presenting the Tantraloka as the ultimate textual au-thority. Self-realization is the goal of all spiritual dis-ciplines and the standard effective tool conceived by them is the power of the Godhead. No other text has been able to drive this truth home more than the Tantraloka and the reason for it lay in Abhinava's taking recourse to his own discerning judgement, un-failing sense of right logic, vast command over Saivis-tic scriptures and above all his deep insight into Trika ideology, in that order.1 All these combined together lent enormous width and intense depth to Abhinava's treatment. Knowledge in order to earn transcendence has to pass through three successive stages: (i) it must emanate from a scripture; (ii) it must be thoroughly investigated under a knowledgeable guide; and (iii) it must ultimately form basic core of one's experience pg14</p>
    
    <p>We are, therefore, tempted to suggest that three-fold epistemic methodology consisting of verbal testi-mony, reasoning and perception (Agama, Yukti and Pratyaksa) emerged from the triple sources of agamic understanding - scripture, guide and self pg15</p>
    
    <p>one of the undeclared objectives of Abhinava is to restore and preserve the existing and traditionally acquired tantric literature and practices. pg16</p>
    
    <p>Motives (a) DECLARED To compose the Tantraloka (i) as a compendium, (ii) as a manual, (iii) as a prayer. (b) UNDECLARED (i) To produce a scripturistic treatise (Sastra) pg17</p>
    
    <p>Objectives (a) DECLARED (i) (a) To realise self and make others realise the same, (b) To propound fourfold redemptive know-ledge, (ii) To afford easy comprehension of the abs-truse traditional secrets. (b) UNDECLARED (i) To devise an-overriding textual authority, (ii) To restore the tantric learning and practices. pg17</p>
