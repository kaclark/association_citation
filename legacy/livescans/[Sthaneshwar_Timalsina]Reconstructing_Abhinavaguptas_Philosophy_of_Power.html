    <p>Abhinavagupta does not have sole pro-priety over the philosophy of power as his predecessors, particularly Somānanda and Utpala, have addressed this issue, and multiple exchang-es with philosophers such as Bhartṛhari and Kumārila have signifi-cantly shaped the discourse on power to accord with Abhinavagupta’s own thinking. Philosophers subsequent to Abhinavagupta, such as Maheśvarānanda or Amṛtānanda, have likewise engaged their under-standing of power. Śākta philosophical literature culminates within the works of Abhinava. By excavating the philosophy of power from his monistic paradigm, our metaphysics can be grounded on Śākta philosophy. pg2</p>
    
    <p>the focus is not about semantic or cosmic power, but the power that we experience and express in our mundane world, in our social interactions, in the cultural and social dialogues that we construct and deconstruct, and in the political power that allows states to exert their force within and outside of their own territories. pg2</p>
    
    <p>There were two predecessors from whom Abhinavagupta borrows for his philos-ophy of Śakti whose ideas also overlap the regions of the sacred and secular powers. One is Bhartṛihari’s philosophy of semantic power. Although the primary objectives of these two philosophers differ, as one is writing on language and the other on metaphysics, Bhartṛihari actually goes beyond discussing language and touches upon metaphys-ics, and Abhinava goes beyond discussing metaphysics and addresses semantic power. I have already written on this nexus of linguistic and cosmic powers elsewhere, and so there is no need to discuss it fur-ther.1 The second predecessor is the Mīmāṃsā philosophy of power that engages mantric and ritual powers, engaging the magical within the conversation on power. Bhartṛihari has elevated language from the confinement of sign and reference and has given it a metaphysical foundation. In so doing, he has already utilized some of the Mīmāṃsā convictions.2 Taking this one step further, Abhinava’s ritual philosophy does exploit some of the premises derived from Mīmāṃsā that ground both the ritual expression of power and the power of speech that cross-es the boundary of semantic expression. pg5-6</p>
    
    <p>One of the most original concepts found in Utpala/Abhinava is the equation of freedom with power while making freedom an inextricably essential attribute of consciousness qua self. I will address this partic-ular issue in a separate section. The metaphysical foundation for this equation comes from the monistic understanding of citi, consciousness, as autonomous in manifesting both as myriads of subjects and as inani-mate entities. pg6</p>
    
    <p>Abhinavaguptian power is not “power over,” but self-empowerment. Power is an intrinsic constituent of the self and is actualized by means of self-realization rather than in a clash with the other, or by means of subjugation. This understanding of power translates into freedom as an inherent, intrinsic thrust, rather than freedom over something. This makes freedom a positive endeavor, that subjects are to seek freedom within, rather than to strive for free-dom from the chains of the others. This also subverts the understanding that power is always in tension, that power relates to or equates with struggle. This is not to say that no ‘struggle for power’ exists; this only makes it possible to argue for another dimension of power, the power necessary for sustaining harmony. pg6</p>
    
    <p>Harmony functions in both the personal and social domains. On the personal level, an inner harmony of the mind and the body makes it possible for subjects to live a productive and fulfilled life. On a collective level, social harmony makes it possible for each individual to maintain personal harmony and simultaneously for the collective to thrive. This inner actualization of power reverses the gaze of subjects from outside objects, and makes it possible for the subject to ‘negate’ its own territory so that the ‘other’ can enter the circle. pg6-7</p>
