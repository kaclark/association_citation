    <p>The Mulamadhyamakakarika (MKK) by Nagarjuna (ca 150 C.E.) is the foundational text of the Madhyamaka school of Indian Buddhist philosophy. It consists of verses constituting twenty-seven chapters. In it, Nagarjuna seeks to establish the chief tenet of Madhyamaka, that all things are empty (sunya) or devoid of intrinsitc nature (svabhava). The claim that all things are empty first apperas in the Buddhist tradition in the early Mahayana sutras known collectively as Prajnaparamita, beginning roughly in the first century B.C.E. pg 1</p>
    
    <p>As is usual in texts of this nature, the arguments are presented in highly compressed form and so are extremely difficult to comprehend without a commentary. This is due to the nature and purpose of such texts. A karika is a work in verse form that contains a concise formulation of some (often philosophical) doctrine; the karikas are the individual verses making up the work. Texts of this sort were originally used beccause it is easier to memorize information when it is put in verse form. pg 2</p>
    
    <p>paraphrase: four commentaries have been written on the MMK; they differ in some ways but generally they were utilized to guide the translation before us pg -1</p>
