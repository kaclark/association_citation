    <p>The Paradise of Submission (Rawda-yi taslim), also known as the   Tasawwurat due to the key-word ta$awwur (`conception' or 'thought')   which invariably introduces the title of each of its twenty-seven chapters,'   is a masterful compendium of medieval Ismaili thought. More specifi-  cally, it is a unique source for the study of ideas and doctrines held by   the Nizari Ismailis under the second-to-last Lord of Alamnt, 'Ala' al-  Din Muhammad III (r. 618-53/1221-55). As such, it reflects the vision   of Islam that distinguished the Nizaris at a time when two seemingly   contradictory events in their recent history needed to be interpreted   and harmonised: the proclamation of the Resurrection (qiyamat) by   Hasan II (known to Ismailis as Hasan `ala dhikrihi al-salqm) in 559/1164   and the restoration of the formal observation of the sharrat under laid'   al-Din Hasan III in 607/1210. The sharrat is evidently recognised in   our text (paras 426-53), though only as a form taken by the spiritual   Truth (haqayiq) in this material world of relative values (idafat) and is   discussed at length in terms of the 'seven pillars of Islam' along classical   Fatimid lines of interpretation. The present time, the author suggests   (para 345), is a new 'epoch of concealment' (rtizgeir- i satr), and as the   Imams themselves have imposed 'prudence' (taqiyya) as a religious   duty, the inner truth (haqiqat) must remain hidden in the hearts of the   believers. By referring to an 'epoch of concealment; he is apparently al-  luding to ancient mythological conceptions of cyclical time in Ismaili   liero-history', 2which are explained earlier in the text (paras 173-75 and pg</p>
    
    <p>319-21). These 'cycles' (dawn, pl. adwar) are, however, of rather cosmic   dimensions since they involve altogether seven times seven thousand   years, with major periods dominated by the rule of Prophetic Law or   `concealment' (dawr-i satr), being both preceded and followed each time   by periods of Resurrection or 'unveiling' (dawr-i kash1). Yet, despite his   appeal to `concealment' and 'prudence' as applicable to the present time,   our author is remarkably eloquent about the eternal reality manifest in   the person of the Imam of the time (muhiqq-i waqt), the ever present   manifestation of the divine 'Word' (kalima-yi a`la) or 'Command' (amr;   e.g. paras 266-7 1, 33o, 350-82), and he clearly reasserts the position of   klasan dhikrihi al-salam as the 'Lord of Resurrection' (qa'im) who   came 50o plus forty years after the Prophet as the 'second blast of the   trumpet of the Resurrection' (i.e., forty years after Hasan-i Sabbah, d.   518/1124, the 'first blast of the trumpet'; paras 475-82).   Completed, as we now know, in 64o/1243 under the supervision of   a high-ranking Nizari official, and with the written approval of the fa-  mous scholar Nasir al-Din al-Tusi (597-672/12ot-74), this compendium   undoubtedly owes something to Tusi's own teaching at Alamut. As is   known, 3Tusi had spent nearly thirty years of his life as a protége of the   Nizaris during the Mongol invasions of Persia. The Nizari state was then   still in a position to offer attractive libraries and relative security even   to outside scholars, while Khwarazm and much of eastern Persia had   already been conquered and severely devastated by the Mongols. It was,   however, weakened not only by the pressure of the advancing Mongols   and a generally hostile environment, but also by serious internal tensions   within its leadership, which eventually led to the murder of the Imam   `Ala' al-Din Muhammad III in 653/1255, and, only one year later, to the   surrender of his youthful successor, Rukn al-Din Khurshah, to   The downfall of the Nizari strongholds of course affected the condition   of the Persian Ismailis in the first place, but it also opened the way for   the Mongol sack of Baghdad and the effective overthrow of the Abbasid   caliphate in 656/1258.   Tasi had evidently been a personal admirer of 'Ala' al-Din   Muhammad III, whom he praised in a poem as the 'lord of mankind'   (mawla al-anam), suggesting that those devoted to him, having recog-  nised his noble aim, will be triumphant in the ultimate world. 4We also   know that he exchanged correspondence on questions of philosophical   theology with another personal protégé of this Nizari Imam: the Sufi pg</p>
    
    <p>Shaykh Jamal al-Din al-Jili (or Gili, Gilaki, d. 651/1253), one among the   famous 'twelve disciples' of Najm al-Din al-Kubra (d. 618/1221), who was   residing in nearby Qazwin. 5Under Rukn al-Din Khurshah, however,   Tusi apparently judged the situation at Alamat to have become totally   untenable and chose to offer his services to the new masters of Persia.   Disclaiming then any sympathies he might have had for the Ismailis,   he soon became what he is mostly remembered for in Iran: a wise and   powerful vizier in the Ilkhanid administration, a great scientist and as-  tronomer, and a highly respected Twelver Shi'i theologian and philoso-  pher. 6Yet the original versions of his most famous philosophical works   such as the Nasirean Ethics and the Asas al-iqtibas (both in Persian),   or the Arabic Commentary on Avicenna's Isharat wa-tanbihat, which   was written mainly in defence of Avicenna against the 'misunderstand-  ings' of Fakhr al-Din al-Razi (d. 6o6/12o9), as well as several works on   astronomy' were all written during his long-standing association with   the Ismailis. During the same period he also wrote several small treatises   revealing a profound Ismaili consonance in his own thinking, including   an autobiography known as Sayr wa Sulak. The latter leaves very little   doubt indeed that he himself had adopted Ismailism at that time out of   conviction, and it is accepted as one of his writings even by those who   are reluctant to recognise it as a genuine expression of his religious al-  legiance. 8But the case of the Paradise of Submission is quite different, not   least because of its unusual style. Indeed it was mainly for linguistic and   stylistic reasons that the distinguished Iranian expert on Tusi's writings,   M.T. Mudarris Radawi, rejected the attribution of this work to his pen   categorically. 9   Preserved within the Ismaili community up to the present day in   manuscript copies ascribing it to Tusi, our Persian text was published   for the first time in 1950 thanks to the pioneering efforts of Wladimir   Ivanow, along with an English translation and a lengthy introduction. I9    This previous edition was, however, based on two very late and defective   manuscripts only; and the English translation, apart from being rather   approximate in many places, could hardly be said to have been congenial.   Better and older manuscripts having come to light in the meantime it   became an urgent and challenging task for Ismaili scholarship to prepare   a new edition and translation, and to gain a clearer picture of what Tusi's   own role in its production may actually have been. If as a result it has now   been possible to present the Paradise of Submission on a more reliable pg</p>
    
    <p>basis, this is first and foremost thanks to Dr Jalal Badakhchani's sustained   research work, which was submitted for in an earlier version in 1987 as   a PhD dissertation to the University of Oxford. Dr Badakhchani's 1987   text edition, partial translation and introduction led subsequently to the   first modern translation into French by Christian Jambet, which was pub-  lished with a new introduction and notes as La convocation d'Alamtit:   Somme de philosophie ismaelienne (Lagrasse, 1996). Professor Jambet's   philosophical analysis as contained in his introduction has been made   available in an abridged English version for the present volume as well   (cf. Appendix), which, thus, in a sense constitutes the third stage of an   ongoing process. Based now on five manuscripts, the present publica-  tion offers a newly revised edition of the Persian text along with a new   translation, which aims to render the original as faithfully as possible   while making it accessible in modern, readable English.   As is explained in more detail in the editor's Preface, the oldest   manuscript known so far is a copy made according to its colophon in   968/156o (referred to as 'M'). This copy has been preserved in separate   portions of text found in various parts of a unique codex of Ismaili   writings, which apparently contained the Paradise of Submission origi-  nally as its first item. However, an unknown number of folios at the be-  ginning was evidently replaced at some point with nine folios containing   two other items, namely, six pages of an extract from the Maqsad-i aqsa   of the Sufi writer 'Aziz-i Nasafi,' Ifollowed by nine pages of poetry on the   genealogy of Ismaili Imams up to al-Mustansir bi'llah II (also known as   Shah Qalandar under his Sufi name, d. ca. 885/148o). As a result, the text   begins abruptly on p. 15 in the middle of Tasawwur 3 (para 34), so that   the preamble, the table of contents, all of the first two chapters and part   of Tasawwur 3 are unfortunately missing. Among other items contained   in various places in this codex there are also some pieces of questions and   answers which may cast a light on the milieu in which the Paradise of   Submission was compiled or transmitted at an early stage without being   part of it. They are not designated as tasawwur in the manuscript; and   there is no need to assume that they originally belonged to the mysteri-  ous Tasawwur 28 whose very existence is suggested only by the table of   contents of the manuscripts used by Ivanow. Two among these items, on   spiritual oneness with the Imam' and on the hierarchy of knowledge, I3    have been added in the present volume as an Annex, as in the French   translation by Christian Jambet. pg</p>
    
    <p>One of the unique features of the manuscript copy M is that its   colophon, placed at the end of Tasawwur 27, reproduces a note writ-  ten according to the copyist by Tusi himself at the end of the Rawda-yi   taslim. Iasi thereby in effect attested that he had read the entire work in   the presence of its compiler (jcImi), a high-placed dignitary, chief da`i   and well-known writer of poetry and prose by name of $alah al-Din   Hasan-i Mahmud, on Tuesday, 15th Shawwal A -4o, 7t.. April, / A 1243 (for a   literal translation see pp. 170-171). This attestation appears to be genuine   enough (the 15th of Shawwal 64o A.H. was indeed a Tuesday!) and is   certainly evidence of Tusi's own involvement with this text. At the very   least, it would seem to imply that he was being consulted when the final   text was about to be released. However, its wording in no way establishes   him as the author of the work. On the contrary, he rather seems to be   delegating responsibility for it to klasan-i Mahmud by referring explicitly   to him as the 'compiler' - a term which could also mean `author'" - and   by congratulating this important da`i very politely for spiritual benefits   obtained from it 'in accordance with his own aptitude:   On the other hand, the heading of the preamble (which is not   extant in 'M', as indicated above) certainly suggests to begin with that   this work belongs to the discourse (kalam) of Tfisi himself. But then   this heading was obviously added at some later stage, and the identity of   the writer of the preamble remains unclear. Was it indeed Tusi himself,   or someone else, who introduced this text by indicating that it was he   who 'transferred from speech to writing' whatever he had recorded and   established in his mind from these 'thoughts' (tasawwurat), according to   his own understanding; that he put it all into the form of a compilation   (majmu`a), gave it the title Paradise of Submission, and sent it to 'dearest   brother Badr al-Din Husayn''' for consideration by the 'noble leaders   of religion'? Ivanow's version, to be sure, has the writer of the preamble   identify himself as 'Muhammad b. Hasan-i Tusi' (meaning, of course,   Muhammad b. Muhammad b. Hasan-i Tasi); but this dubious self-iden-  tification is not supported by the best available manuscripts (`Q' and 'A'),   and has accordingly been omitted in the present edition.' 6   Now if the preamble was not written by 'Iasi himself, then this obvi-  ously means that neither was he the one who put these tasawwurat into   writing. This would seem to leave us again with the 'compiler' Hasan-i   Mahmud to whom Tusi himself refers in his attestation. Certain linguis-  tic peculiarities found right from the beginning in the preamble as well as pg</p>
    
    <p>here and there in the main body of the text, notably the frequent use of   the dialectal particle ha which is a feature of all five extant manuscripts,   make it unlikely anyway that Tusi should have personally written down   the text as we have it. This particle, which Ivanow had tried to explain   as possibly reflecting Tasi's own dialect, is not used by him in any of his   unquestionably authentic Persian writings, Ismaili or otherwise, whereas   it is found in such texts as the Haft bab-i Baba Sayyidna, a much shorter   Nizari compendium that was written some forty years earlier. 17A con-  nection between the Paradise of Submission and this earlier Nizari work   can moreover be suggested on the basis of Dr Badakhchani's interesting   observation that the Haft bab-i Baba Sayyidna was in all probability   written by the same klasan-i Mabmad as an introduction to a collection   of his own poetry, the as yet unpublished Qa'imiyyat. Consequently, the   possibility that this important da`i and established Nizari writer of poetry   and prose may have actually written down the Paradise of Submission   himself, or, if the 'thoughts' were indeed Tusi's own, that he rephrased   them in his capacity as 'compiler' or first editor, can certainly not be   excluded.   Such editorial work by klasan-i Mal:m:id, or perhaps a team of edi-  tors directed by him and working with Tusi in the background, would   explain not only certain stylistic and linguistic oddities; it could also   account for some unusually 'extremist' traditions cited in our text, for   example the one about 'Ali as a world-conqueror (paras 473 -74), which   is found in the Haft bab-i Baba Sayyidna in the first place. 18Moreover,   the way certain philosophical issues are presented also suggests that the   editor must at times have exercised a certain discretionary power to suit   his own taste or that of the intended readership. One case in point is   the very short Tasawwur 4, which squarely identifies the Prime Intel-  lect with the Agent Intellect (`aqi-i fa"a1). This identification, which is   in accordance with Ismaili conceptions as defined by Nasir-i Khusraw   (d. after 465/io72-73), 19not only contradicts Tusi's usual Avicennism; it   also contrasts with other parts of our text itself, such as the discussion   in Tasawwur 2, which includes brief reminders of the classical Avicen-  nian cosmology of the ten Intellects (with the Agent Intellect being the   tenth from above; cf. paras 15, 18-2o, 25-27). Similarly, the cosmology   presented in Tasawwurat 5-7, with Intellect, Soul, Nature and Matter   as major hypostasies, simply reproduces a Neoplatonic model such as   the one known from the Rasa'il Ikhwan al-Safa', rather than offering pg</p>
    
    <p>new philosophical or scientific arguments one might expect to see in an   original work of Tasi's, although he may well have accepted to go along   with it for the purpose of this compendium. This model was basically   shared by many Ismaili thinkers prior to Hamid al-Din al-Kirmani (d.   after 411/1o2o), and subsequently restored in Persian Ismailism by Nasir-i   Khusraw. 2°   An instructive example of what possibly comes close to a faithful   reproduction of Tusi's own `discourse' at Alarnat can be seen in the so-  phisticated series of questions and answers that constitute Tasawwurat   and 2. Tasawwur i argues the case for monotheism in a rational and   subtle way which leads inevitably to the Ismaili thesis that ordinary ra-  tional arguments for the existence of God are at best incomplete and at   worst equivalent to self-assertion or unbelief (kufr), because the utterly   transcendent divine in itself cannot be proven by human reason and   only the divine 'Command' or 'Imperative' (amr) can be recognised in   the person of its holder (mawla, wall al-amr), i.e. the Imam. This, then,   leads to the extensive discourse in Tasawwur 2 on the divine amr as   the 'first cause' of existence in a metaphysical and cosmological sense.   As is known, the position of the divine amr as a distinct metaphysical   entity between God and the Prime Intellect was a more or less common   feature of classical Ismaili thought prior to Kirmani, and was taken up   again by Nair-i Khusraw. 2 ' This may be significant in itself as it would   seem to indicate that Nizari doctrine with its insistence on the 'present   Imam' as manifestation of the divine amr was following this particular   line rather than Kirmani's, who systematically sought to de-emphasise   whatever could give rise to 'temptations of divinity' (especially in the   Druze case), and whose refined thought had on the whole a much greater   impact on Tayyibi than on Nizari doctrine. More importantly for our   purpose, this chapter is indeed consistent with Tasi's own thought, not   only because of its Avicennian components, but precisely because of the   philosophical necessity of the divine amr and its oneness that is being   demonstrated. In fact, Tusi himself argued succinctly and logically in his   Sayr wa Suluk for the metaphysical and epistemological necessity of this   intermediary between God and the Prime Intellect. He there suggests   that the philosophers, in ignoring it, simply failed to think through the   consequences of their own emanationist system, and makes it clear that   it was this doctrine of the amr which convinced him of the superiority of   Ismailism in the first place. 22A question of compatibility may, however, pg</p>
    
    <p>arise with the Ismaili solution offered in Tasawwur 3 to the age-old   problem of how the many proceed from the One. This was an extremely   important issue for TUsi, who developed a mathematical model of his   own in a number of treatises, including several pages of the Commentary   on Avicenna's Ishanit, in order to demonstrate that only one can indeed   proceed directly from the One, as Avicenna had taught. 23Although even   in this philosophical Commentary the one emerging directly from the   One is arguably the creative amr rather than the Intellect, as has been   shown elsewhere, 24the solution offered in Tasawwur 3 is nevertheless   somewhat different in nature, and indeed quite original. The Ismailis, our   text suggests, put both the ordinary theologians (para 3o) and the phi-  losophers (para 31) in their place by arguing, first of all, that an emergence   of anything from God can neither be asserted nor denied absolutely, so   that no humanly conceivable solution will ever be absolutely true; and   since the divine amr 'shines equally' upon all creation and existence, all   individuals will ultimately depend on their relative existential rank and   point of view. Therefore, only the Intellect is bound to say: 'only one can   issue from the One whereas the Soul (being placed in between Intellect   and Body) will say: 'one and many issue from the One and the Body can   only say: 'nothing can issue from the One but the many'!   The main purpose of our compendium is not, however, to explain   the origin of the universe, but to provide an all-inclusive orientation on   man's place in this world and his ultimate becoming. This theme begins   in Tasawwur 8, on the human soul, which is essentially a summary of   Avicennian notions of the soul, especially the human soul as an indivis-  ible, immaterial substance governing the body and receiving intellectual   forms (paras 51-4 and 57ff.). At the same time, it contains an interest-  ing passage (paras 55-6) on the 'imaginal soul' (nafs-i khayali) as an   intermediary between the animal soul and the human soul, or between   the sensible and the intelligible domains, and on the role of an 'imagi-  nal body' (or shape, hay'at) retained by the soul after physical death.   This passage actually prepares the ground for an original philosophy   of bodily resurrection - 'bodily' in the sense in which the soul can be   said to become the 'matter' of higher spiritual 'forms' it acquires in the   process of its actualisation (cf. paras 63-64) - which is explained in more   detail in Tasawwur 21 (cf. paras 242 and 257ff.) and constitutes one of   the major themes of this work. Although a somewhat similar idea about   imagination surviving the death of the body can be found in Avicenna,25 pg</p>
    
    <p>the way it is put here considerably modifies Avicennian intellectualism   and is not, in fact, taken from Avicenna. The whole passage, including   the cryptic statement that 'in this world human beings are spiritual be-  ings clothed in corporeal bodies, while in the next they are corporeal   beings clothed in spirituality' (para 56) is clearly taken from one of the   `answers' given by Shahrastani's `1:lanifs' to the pagan philosophers called   `Sabians' in his al-Milal wa'l-nibal (completed by 521/1127), 26that is to   say, doubtless from the unknown Ismaili source used by Shahrastani   for this famous 'dialogue'; 27and it is worth pointing out that the entire   final chapter of our compendium reproduces that same source as well,   and as a whole. As was noted by Hodgson, 28a likely common source for   Shahrastani's 'dialogue' and the final chapter of our compendium is one   of the lost writings of Hasan-i Sabbab (d. 518/1124) himself, especially as   his doctrine of ta`lim, which is also known from Shahrastani's Milal, is   expressly evoked in paras 477f., just before the final Tcwtwwur 27 begins.   The ostensible purpose of this final chapter is to prove the superiority of   the final outcome of creation, that is to say, the human being composed   of spirit and body, over purely celestial or spiritual beings supposed to   be closer to God. By implication, its purpose is evidently to show the   appropriateness of worshipping God through the perfect manifestation   of the Prime Intellect in a human body - in other words, the hujjat,   the immediate deputy of the Imam (paras 514-8; cf. 254, 330. 356, 384,   399-401); and the hujjat par excellence, our text suggests, was no one else   than Hasan-i Sabbab (cf. para 477). All this would seem to indicate that   the spiritual teaching dispensed in our compendium owes probably more   to Hasan-i Sabbah's doctrine than appears on the surface. Of course Tusi   may very well have enriched it with his own philosophical contributions,   and cleverly woven it together with his Avicennism; but he was certainly   not the only weaver of the carpet.   This Nizari dispensation involves first of all a fundamentally Gnos-  tic distinction between two totally different groups (cf. especially paras   129-34, 193ff., 238): the 'followers of truth' (ahl-i baqq or muhiqqiin) and   the 'followers of falsehood' (mubtilan), also simply called the `opponents'   or `people of discord' (ahl-i tadadd). The `followers of truth' are, how-  ever, themselves sub-divided into the `people of unity' (ahl-i wabdat)   on one hand, and the 'people of gradation' (ahl-i tarattub) on the other,   so that we have in fact a tripartite division of mankind, in accordance   with a famous wisdom-saying traditionally attributed to 'Ali (cf. paras pg</p>
    
    <p>and which also corresponds to the general distinction between   Intellect, Soul and Body (paras 117f., 218-2o, 262). The 'people of unity',   that is, the Imam and the supreme hujjat, are those who have never left   the domain of Oneness and Necessary Existence in reality, even though   they do appear in flesh and blood depending on the circumstances in   this material world of 'relativity' (paras 238, 262); they therefore have no   need to 'return' (ma'ad) to their original domain. As for the 'opponents'   or 'followers of falsehood, they have no 'return' to that domain either, but   for opposite reasons: they never had any real 'origin' in the first place and   are forever condemned to pure non-existence (imtita; cf. paras 229, 238   and 262). Thus, only the intermediary group, the 'people of gradation',   have a chance as well as a duty to 'return' to the uncontaminated state   of origin which is frequently referred to as fitrat, a Qur'anic term which   has also philosophical connotations. These people are, of course, the rank   and file of the Nizari da`wat. The fact that they appear to be identical with   the 'followers of religious law' (ahl-i shar`, para 118) does not contradict   this point; it simply confirms the acceptance of the sharrat by the Nizaris   in the sense briefly indicated at the beginning of this introduction.   The tripartite division of mankind is sometimes replaced by a four-  fold structure, implying a difference between the hujjat and the Imam,   especially where the hierarchy of knowledge (Ta$awwur 13; cf. also paras   39off. and 454) and the structure of existence itself (Ta$awwur 20 and   21) are concerned. In one passage (para 235), the history of the Nizari   da`wat appears to be envisioned in terms of a gradual development in   four stages, beginning with the summons to Paradise by the Prophet, and   ending up with the summons to the 'Lord of Resurrection] (khuda): The   first summons required only the sacrifice of 'body and wealth' on the part   of those being summoned. The second, namely, the call to 'knowledge'   (meaning probably 'Ali) required in addition their sacrifice of 'anger   and lust'. The third, which was the call to 'somebody' (kasi, meaning   probably Hasan-i Sabi:0, i.e. the hujjat also referred to as kasi in para   268), required in addition the sacrifice of their 'knowledge and intellect;   while the fourth and final call, totalling all the previous requirements,   was conditioned by their forsaking 'their own selves' (khudi-yi khud).   Although the message conveyed in this passage is highly allusive,   and subject to different interpretations, it is important because it seems to   provide a structural link between the self-image of the community on one   hand, and, on the other, a more generalised philosophy of resurrection pg</p>
    
    <p>through 'submission' (taslim) which animates the whole compendium   and constitutes indeed the main theme of Tasawwurat 20-24. As briefly   outlined in paras 221-30, this philosophy involves the notions of a spiri-  tual ascent (taraqqi, also called mi`raj in para 283), from the animated   material body to the 'resurrectional Intellect' (`aql-i qiyamati), and a   gradual motion of existence itself (wujad) towards perfection both mate-  rial and spiritual, with every lower level of creation serving as 'body of   resurrection' for the immediately superior one to which it 'submits' (cf.   especially paras 257 and 3ooff.).   It is not the purpose of this introduction to discuss this philosophy   in any detail. A word on its significance as a Shi'i philosophy of resur-  rection may, however, be in order. As such, it could be seen as marking a   transition between the radically 'resurrectionist' thought of Abu Ya'qub   al Sijistani (4th/loth century) 29and the philosophy of 'being-toward-res-  urrection' elaborated much later by the celebrated Twelver Shil thinker   Mulla Sadra Shirazi (d. 1o5oh64o-41)." It is not known whether the   Paradise of Submission was available to Sadra, but there is, in any case, a   remarkable affinity between the philosophical ideas given expression in   our text and Sadra's key idea of the soul as being engaged in a process of   actualisation and transformation from 'bodily origination' to 'spiritual   permanence', or from being the 'form' of the body in this world to becom-  ing the 'matter' of spiritual forms in the other. 3 ' On the other hand, it has   been shown that Sadra got much of his inspiration on eschatological mat-  ters from a definitely authentic treatise by Tasi, the Aghaz wa Anjcitn, al-  though he never identifies this source either. 32What is remarkable about   this mystical treatise on 'The Beginning and the End' is that, although   not an explicitly Ismaili work like the Paradise of Submission, it is, in fact,   replete with allusions to Ismaili ideas and specifically Nizari terminol-  ogy33- a fact which could hardly have escaped the attention of Twelver   Shil readers. Even so, it was accepted already by the Shil Sufi Elaydar-i   Amuli (d. after 787/1385) as one of the highlights of 'esoteric' doctrine. 34    Thus, given Tfisi's knowledge of Ismailism, his personal involvement with   the Nizaris, and his influence as a Twelver Shi`i thinker later in his career,   he could well have played an important role as a transmitter of originally   Ismaili ideas to later Twelver Shi'i thought. pg</p>
