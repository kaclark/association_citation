    <p>Newton developed the power series for y = arcsin x, in effect by defining it in terms of an area and using the area formula. He then produced the power series for the sine by solving the equation y = arcsin x for r = sin y by inversion of the series. What Newton did not know, however, was that both the area formula-which he believed had been developed some 35 years earlier-and the power series for the sine had been known for hundreds of years elsewhere in the world. In particular, the area formula had been developed in Egypt around the year A.D. 1000 and the power series for the sine, as well as for the cosine and the arctangent, had been developed in
India, probably in the fourteenth century.</p>
