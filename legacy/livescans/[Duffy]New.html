    <p>Deleuze’s texts are replete with examples of mathematical problems drawn from   dif­ferent historical periods. These engagements with mathematics rely upon the   extraction of mathematical problematics or series of problems from the history of   mathematics that have led to the development of alternative lineages in the history of   mathematics, in order to use them to reconfigure particular philosophical problems,   and to construct new concepts in response to them. Despite the significance of   mathematics for the development of Deleuze’s philosophy being widely acknowledged,   relatively little research has been done in this area. One of the aims of this book is   to address this critical deficit by providing a philosophical presentation of Deleuze’s   relation to mathematics, one that is adequate to his project of constructing a   philosophy of difference, and to its application in other domains. This project   undertakes an examination of the engagements between the discourse of philosophy   and developments in the discipline of mathematics that structure Deleuze’s philosophy.   It approaches this issue initially by way of a historical study of the developments in the   history of mathematics, which Deleuze develops as an alternative lineage in the history   of mathematics, and of the relation between these developments in mathematics and   the history of philosophy. In doing so, it provides examples of the way that Deleuze   extracts mathematical problems from the history of mathematics, and of how these   are then redeployed in relation to the history of philosophy. The aim is to provide   an account of the mathematical resources that Deleuze draws upon in his project of   constructing a philosophy of difference.  Deleuze’s engagements with mathematics can be characterized in a general and   schematic way as consisting of three different components:  (1) The first component can be characterized as the history of mathematics relevant   to each of the programs or mathematical disciplines with which Deleuze engages, and   the mathematical problems or problematics that are extracted from them. Deleuze   defines a “problematic” as “the ensemble of the problem and its conditions” (DR 177).   The alternative lineages in the history of mathematics that are of interest to Deleuze   are based on noncanonical research problems and the solutions that have subsequently   been offered to these problems. The relation between the canonical history of   mathematics and the alternative lineages that Deleuze extracts from it are most clearly   exemplified in the difference between what can be described as the axiomatized set   theoretical explications of mathematics and those developments or research programs   in mathematics that fall outside of the parameters of such an axiomatics, for example,   algebraic topology, functional analysis, and differential geometry, to name but a few.   Deleuze does not subscribe to what Corfield characterizes as “the logicists idea that   mathematics contains nothing beyond an elaboration of the consequences of sets of pg 0</p>
    
    <p>axioms” (2003, 23). This difference can be understood to be characteristic of the relation   between what Deleuze and Guattari in A Thousand Plateaus (1987) refer to as Royal   or major science and nomadic or minor science. Royal or major science refers to those   practices that fall within the scientific norms and methodological conventions of the   time, whereas nomad or minor science refers to those practices that fall outside of such   disciplinary habits and resist attempts to be reduced to them. Scientific normativity can   therefore be understood to operate as a set of principles according to which respectable   research in mathematics is conducted, despite the fact that developments continue to   be made that undermine such constraints and, by a process of destabilization and   regeneration, lead to the development of alternative systems for structuring such   normative frameworks. The aim of this book is to provide an account of the key figures   and mathematical problems in the history of mathematics with which Deleuze engages   and draws upon to structure the alternative normative framework that is developed   in his project of constructing a philosophy of difference. An understanding of each of   the mathematical engagements that Deleuze undertakes requires a clear explication   of the history of mathematics from which the specific mathematical problematic has   been extracted, and of the alternative lineage in the history of mathematics that has   developed in relation to it.  (2) The second component of each of Deleuze’s engagements with mathematics   can be characterized as the explication of the manner by means of which these   interventions in the history of mathematics are redeployed by Deleuze in relation   to the history of philosophy. The mathematical problematics extracted from the   history of mathematics are directly redeployed by Deleuze in order to reconfigure   particular philosophical problematics in relation to the history of philosophy. This   is achieved by mapping the alternative lineages in the history of mathematics onto   corresponding alternative lineages in the history of philosophy, i. e. by isolating those   points of convergence between the mathematical and philosophical problematics   extracted from their respective histories. This is achieved by using the mathematical   problems of these alternative lineages in the history of mathematics as models to   reconfigure the philosophical problems and to develop the implications of these   reconfigured philosophical problems by constructing an alternative lineage in the   history of philosophy. The redeployment of mathematical problematics as models   for philosophical problematics is one of the strategies that Deleuze employs in his   engagement with and reconfiguration of the history of philosophy.  It is important to note that Deleuze eschews characterizing his redeployment of   mathematical problems and problematics as simply analogical or metaphorical. He is   careful to distinguish between those mathematical notions that are quantitative and   exact in nature, which it is “quite wrong” to use metaphorically “because they belong   to exact science” (N 29), and those mathematical problems that are “essentially inexact   yet completely rigorous” (N 29) and which have led to important developments not   only in mathematics and science in general, but also in other nonscientific areas such   as philosophy and the arts. Deleuze argues that this sort of notion is “not unspecific   because something’s missing but because of its nature and content” (N 29). An example   of an inexact and yet rigorous notion, which is presented in Chapter 1, is Henri   Poincaré’s qualitative theory of differential equations which develops the concept of pg 0</p>
    
    <p>an essential singularity. The different kinds of essential singularity are observed by   virtue of the trajectories of variables across a potential function, rather than because   there is a specific mathematical proof of their existence. Another example, which is   presented in Chapter 5, is a Riemann Space, which Deleuze describes as occurring   “when the connecting of parts is not predetermined but can take place in many ways:   it is a space which is disconnected, purely optical, sound or even tactile (in the style of   Bresson)” (CII 129). While Deleuze recognizes that citing mathematical notions of the   exact kind outside of their particular sphere would rightly expose one to the criticism   of “arbitrary metaphor or of forced application” (CII 129), he defends the use he makes   of mathematical notions of the inexact kind. He does so on the grounds that by “taking   from scientific operators a particular conceptualizable character which itself refers to   non-scientific areas” (CII 129), the redeployment of this conceptualizable character   in relation to another nonscientific area is justified. What this means is that the other   nonscientific area “converges with science without applying it or making it a metaphor”   (CII 129). A useful way of characterizing the relation between the conceptualizable   character of the inexact mathematical notion and this conceptualizable character   as redeployed in other nonscientific areas, insofar as the latter converges with the   former, is to refer to it as a modeling relation. That is, the conceptualizable character as   redeployed in a nonscientific area is modeled on the conceptualizable character of the   inexact mathematical notion. What distinguishes a modeling relation from a relation   of analogy or metaphor is that there are “correspondences without resemblance” (DR   184) between them. That is, there is a correspondence between the conceptualizable   character in each instance; however, there is no resemblance between the scientific   elements of the mathematical problem and the nonscientific elements of the discourse   in which this conceptualizable character has been redeployed. It is this conceptualizable   character that is characteristic of the two examples above and of all of the mathematical   problems that Deleuze deploys in his philosophy as models to reconfigure philosophical   problems and to construct alternative lineages in the history of philosophy.  (3) It is the creation of new concepts by bringing together mathematical and   philosophical problematics that constitutes the third component of these Deleuzian   engagements with mathematics. The reconfigured philosophical problematics that   Deleuze extracts and the alternative lineages in the history of philosophy that he   develops in relation to them are then redeployed either in relation to mathematical   problematics that facilitated this extraction or in relation to one another, or in relation   to problematics similarly extracted from other discourses, to create new concepts.   One example of the former is the concept of singularity constructed in relation to the   problem of the relationship between the universal and the particular in the work of   Leibniz and its subsequent development in the history of mathematics.  The way in which these three components are implicated in relation to one another   determines the manner by means of which Deleuze’s interventions in the history of   mathematics serve in his project of constructing a philosophy of difference. The aim   of this book is to develop an argument that clearly demonstrates the nature of this   implication, more specifically, how the alternative lineages in the history of mathematics   are mapped onto or serve as models for the corresponding alternative lineages in the   history of philosophy. pg 0</p>
    
    <p>The mathematical problematic that will be explored in Chapter 1 is the problem of   continuity as encountered by Leibniz’s mathematical approach to natural philosophy,   which draws upon the law of continuity as reflected in the calculus of infinite series and   the infinitesimal calculus. This chapter is seminal in providing the historical background   of the main alternative lineage in the history of mathematics that Deleuze draws upon.   It will examine the reconstruction of Leibniz’s metaphysics that Deleuze undertakes   in The Fold (1993), which provides a systematic account of the structure of Leibniz’s   metaphysics in terms of its mathematical foundations, much of the preparatory work   for which had already been done in Logic of Sense (1990). It is Leibniz’s development   of the concept of the infinitesimal in his approach to the differential calculus that   represents one of the key innovative developments in the history of mathematics   that is important for Deleuze. The subsequent development of this concept, and of   the mathematical problems to which it is applied, by mathematicians throughout the   history of mathematics represents the alternative lineage in the history of mathematics   that Deleuze traces in his work.1  Chapter 2 examines the role played by Salomon Maimon (b. 1753–1800) in Deleuze’s   response to Kantian idealism and the development of the his distinctive post-Kantian   philosophy, which is a feature of his philosophy of difference. Maimon is critical of the   role played by mathematics in Kant’s philosophy, and suggests a Leibnizian solution   based on the infinitesimal calculus. Deleuze takes up this solution with a number of   omissions, notably the concept of the infinite intellect, and a number of modifications   that are drawn from the subsequent developments in the history of mathematics that   are elaborated in the previous two chapters. Maimon is therefore included in Deleuze’s   construction of an alternative lineage in the history of philosophy that tracks the   development of a series of metaphysical schemes that respond to and attempt to deploy   the concept of the infinitesimal.  In addition to the explicit role played by the infinitesimal calculus in Bergson’s   philosophy, Chapter 3 examines the implicit role of the work of Bernhard Riemann   (b. 1826–1866) in the development of Bergson’s concept of multiplicity. While Bergson   only draws upon one aspect of Riemann’s work, specifically the implications of the   concept of qualitative multiplicity for the development of his concept of duration,   Deleuze rehabilitates and extends Bergson’s work by clarifying and drawing upon the   full potential of Riemann’s mathematical developments, specifically the implications of   the concept of qualitative multiplicity for reconfiguring the concept of space in a way   that does all of the work required by Bergson’s concept of duration.  Chapter 4 examines the implications of the critical program in mathematics   undertaken by Albert Lautman (b. 1908–1944) to the development of Deleuze’s   philosophy. Having provided an account of the mathematical resources that Deleuze   draws upon and of how they operate in his work in the previous four chapters, this   chapter provides a more thorough account of the broader framework that Deleuze   draws upon in order to adequately deploy these resources within his philosophy. This   framework is drawn largely from the work of Lautman, with a number of important   qualifications, including Deleuze’s relation to Lautman’s Platonism and his adoption   of Cavaillès’s reservations as regards the idealist implications in Lautman’s work. It   is argued that Lautman’s concept of the mathematical real, which includes both the pg 0</p>
    
    <p>sum of all mathematical theories and the structure of the problematic ideas that   govern them, provides the blueprint for adequately determining the nature not only   of Deleuze’s engagement with mathematics, but also of the metaphysics of Deleuze’s   philosophical logic.  Deleuze is by no means the only contemporary philosopher to have engaged in work   of this kind. For this reason, the book is not devoted solely to the explication of this   aspect of his work. Chapter 5 is devoted to the critical and comparative investigation of   the logic of these Deleuzian engagements with mathematics, and the logic of another   related effort to mobilize mathematical ideas in relation to the history of philosophy.   The figure that will be used to develop an extended critical comparison with Deleuze’s   engagement with mathematics will be Alain Badiou (b. 1937–). Badiou is the main   contemporary critic of Deleuze’s philosophy, and this criticism bears specifically on   the way in which the relation between mathematics and philosophy is configured in   Deleuze’s work. This chapter develops a robust defense of the structure of Deleuze’s   philosophy, specifically, of its engagement with mathematics, and of the adequacy   of the mathematical problems that Deleuze uses to construct his philosophy. As a   corollary to these arguments, it provides a defense of the Deleuzian framework for the   construction of new concepts. This chapter developed in response to the increasing   number of scholars who are quick to appropriate Badiou’s criticism of Deleuze without   directly engaging with the mathematical aspect of his work and the key role that this   plays in his philosophy. One of the aims of the argument developed in this chapter   is to dispel any concern that a crisis in legitimacy follows from Badiou’s criticism   of Deleuze (Badiou 2000; 2005; 2009). The argument developed in this chapter in   effect provides a firm footing not only for Deleuze’s philosophy and for philosophical   engagements with it, but also for other nonphilosophical engagements with and   deployments of his work. pg 0</p>
