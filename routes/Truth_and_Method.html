(pg  8)</p></div><div class="content" id="content"><p id="entry">In accordance with the frequent transition from becoming to being Bildung (like the contemporary use of the German word "Formation") describes more the result of the process of becoming than the process itself (pg  10)</p></div><div class="content" id="content"><p id="entry">In fact Hegel has worked out very astutely what Bildung is. We follow him initially (pg  11)</p></div><div class="content" id="content"><p id="entry">It is the universal nature of human Bildung to constitute itself as a universal intellectual being. Whoever abandons himself to his particularity is ungebildet ("unformed")—e.g. if someone gives way to blind anger without measure or sense of proportion (pg  11)</p></div><div class="content" id="content"><p id="entry">In his Phenomenology of Spirit Hegel works out the genesis of a truly free self-consciousness "in-and-for-itself" and he shows that the essence of work is to form the thing rather than consume it (pg  11 )</p></div><div class="content" id="content"><p id="entry">In the independent existence that work gives the thing working consciousness finds itself again as an independent consciousness. Work is restrained desire. (pg  11)</p></div><div class="content" id="content"><p id="entry">In forming the object—that is in being selflessly active and concerned with a universal—working consciousness raises itself above the immediacy of its existence to universality; or as Hegel puts it by forming the thing it forms itself (pg  11)</p></div><div class="content" id="content"><p id="entry">What [Hegel] means is that in acquiring a "capacity" a skill man gains the sense of himself (pg  11)</p></div><div class="content" id="content"><p id="entry">Even in this description of practical Bildung by Hegel one can recognize the basic character of the historical spirit: to reconcile itself with itself to recognize oneself in other being (pg  12)</p></div><div class="content" id="content"><p id="entry">To recognize one's own in the alien to become at home in it is the basic movement of spirit whose being consists only in returning to itself from what is other. (pg  13)</p></div><div class="content" id="content"><p id="entry">Hegel emphasizes that a people gives itself its existence in its world. It works out from itself and thus exteriorizes what it is in itself (pg  13)</p></div><div class="content" id="content"><p id="entry">forgetting is not merely an absence and a lack but as Nietzsche in particular pointed out a condition of the life of mind. Only by forgetting does the mind have the possibility of total renewal the capacity to see everything with fresh eyes (pg  14)</p></div><div class="content" id="content"><p id="entry">In scholasticism say for St. Thomas in elaborating on the De Anima the sensus communis is the common root of the outer senses—i.e. the faculty that combines them that makes judgments about what is given a capacity that is given to all men. (pg  20)</p></div><div class="content" id="content"><p id="entry">Le bon sens for Bergson is as the common source of thought and will a "sens social" which avoids both the mistakes of the scientific dogmatists who are looking for social laws and those of the metaphysical Utopians.
