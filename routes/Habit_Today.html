        <div class="content" id="content"><p id="entry">Habit Today</p></div><div class="content" id="content"><p id="entry">Habit is a way in which we can organize lived regularities, moments of cohesion and repetition, in a universe in which nothing truly repeats, in which the past accu- mulates with unrelenting force, ensuring that no moment can ever resemble or repeat a previous moment because it already contains the past within it. For those who affirm perpetual change, Heraclitan variation or Bergsonian duration, habit is an anchor, the rock to which the possibilities of personal identity and freedom are tethered, the condition under which learning is possible, the creation of a direction, a ‘second nature’, an identity.</p></div><div class="content" id="content"><p id="entry">Ravaisson elaborates a new kind of vitalism, in which living beings (the higher the order the more there is a need for habit, a contraction or synthesis of past events) require the stability of habits to organize their world. While consid- ered a virtue, habits also the entail the possibility of a pathology.</p></div><div class="content" id="content"><p id="entry">Habit is change contracted, compressed, contained.</p></div><div class="content" id="content"><p id="entry">[Habit] thus anticipates a possible change. It is, in other words, a potentiality, a possibility, a virtual mode of addressing a future change. It is this that transforms it from an activ- ity to a disposition, or, as Ravaisson calls it, ‘a virtue’, a way of behaving in the world. Habit is a change in behaviour, a virtue that is activated whether it is called for or not, a permanent or semi- permanent modification of the agent of action</p></div><div class="content" id="content"><p id="entry">Habit is a degree of instinct, a modifiable, pliable, learned impulse to act. It functions mid-way between reflective decision-making with its time and effort, and instinct with its unerring but unchangeable responsiveness. Habit is the point of transition, the mode by which reflective or voluntary actions function as if they were instinctive. Habit is the movement by which effort and consideration is transformed into action. Habit performs a kind of condensation or compaction of bodily action, and a rationalization (and rationing) of the effort an act requires.</p></div><div class="content" id="content"><p id="entry">As a temporally ordering phenomenon, habit is the movement by which Aristotelian potentiality, or the virtual, is transformed into tendency, and tendency in turn is trans- formed into action. Habit is the action of ever-growing connection between the subject and the object of thought, it issues an ‘immediate intelligence’ that by-passes consciousness to produce effects around and through it. Habit is the movement by which ‘ idea becomes being ’ (2008 [1838]: 55), the trajectory by which tendency acts, potentiality makes and the virtual actualizes itself. Habit produces not only a tendency to act and the diminution of the tendency to feel; above all, it produces an ‘obscure intelligence’ that operates below the level of will, consciousness, intentionality or reflection, an intelligence in which all forms of life participate. This unconscious intelligence is what produces an intimate intuition, an attunement of the subject to the object, in which there are still two beings, two entities, an acting or sensing subject and an action performed or a sensation perceived, but entities that remain in the most intimate connection, mingled together with only the barest sliver of a difference between them. Thus habit does not arrest or mechanize, or reduce consciousness to unconsciousness or automatism; rather, it brings about a new kind of consciousness, one not aware of itself but prone to act, that is activated by the possibility of its acting, that knows but cannot know that it knows.</p></div><div class="content" id="content"><p id="entry">Rather than compulsion, habit expresses one’s openness to the future, along with one’s relation of connection to the past: it expresses the continuity of one’s attractions and desires, a cohesion that is endlessly open to modification (as instinct is not), to custom and to expectation. Habit is the accommodation of life to its most insistent and repetitive forces and tasks, life’s transformation through its engagement with a world larger than its will or consciousness.</p></div><div class="content" id="content"><p id="entry">There is a direct lineage between Ravaisson (and his predecessors) and the writings of Bergson. What Bergson found alluring in Ravaisson is both his understanding of the continual processes of change that make up the world in its temporal dimension, and his understanding of philosophy as a mode of attunement to the unique and the particular.</p></div><div class="content" id="content"><p id="entry">Habit, for Bergson, is the production of a form of stability that does not anchor living beings to their environment, but that enables free acts, acts that remain inherently unpredictable, and that in-form and produce specific types of subjectivity, to emerge from the background of habits and quasi-automatized acts. Without habits and their tendency to automatism, living beings would not have the energy and singularity of purpose that enables them to survive and to create, to produce the new, to live artistically.</p></div><div class="content" id="content"><p id="entry">Intensities, sensations, forces are them- selves the first signs in the history of living beings that they can rise above automatism.</p></div><div class="content" id="content"><p id="entry">Movement is the condition of both sentience and of freedom. Habit constitutes a kind of substra- tum that supports and enables acts of great unpredictability and creativity.</p></div><div class="content" id="content"><p id="entry">Free acts, acts not bound to habit, are, for Bergson, quite excep- tional. We are not, as the existentialists claim, thoroughly free, free in every act: rather, all living things exhibit degrees of freedom , linked to the openness of movements, of actions, that such beings are capable of performing.</p></div><div class="content" id="content"><p id="entry">If freedom is located in acts rather than in subjects, then the capacity to act is to a large extent structured by the ability to harness and utilize matter for one’s own purposes. Freedom is not a transcendent quality inherent in subjects but is immanent in the relations that the living being has with the material world, including other forms of life.</p></div><div class="content" id="content"><p id="entry">habit is acquired through repetition which binds various actions, bodily performances and forms of muscular exertion gradually into a continuous whole. Habits have three particular characteristics: they are acquired by repetition; they demand a decomposition and recomposition of various actions or practices; and they are contracted, that is, ‘stored up in a mechanism which is set in motion as a whole by an initial impulse, in a closed system of automatic movements which succeed each other in the same order and, together, take the same length of time’ (1988: 81).</p></div><div class="content" id="content"><p id="entry">Habit is incipient action, action anticipated; it is memory accumulated in order to act. Memory-proper is contemplation, reverie, the slowing down, arrest or simplification of movement: habit is the complexifiction of movement through it routinization. Habit is a form of accumu- lation of memory and repetition in the body.</p></div><div class="content" id="content"><p id="entry">Habit becomes conscious only to the extent that it does not attain its habituated end. Otherwise it is memory lived as bodily preparedness.</p></div><div class="content" id="content"><p id="entry">As is by now well known, Deleuze, probably the most significant Bergsonian of the late 20th century, is largely responsible for the revitalization of interest in Bergson. What fascinated him about Bergson was Bergson’s understanding of the object of philosophical speculation: philosophy, for Bergson, is the attunement to the unique and the particular, a mode of addressing the singular, just as Bergson himself was attracted to Ravaisson. It is the creation of a method (intuition) and an object (the unique and the particular) through understanding a series of processes (becoming, differentiation) that fascinated Deleuze. For Deleuze, Bergson is the greatest theorist of difference, the philosopher who best understood that philosophy is a way of enhancing life rather than a mode of truth, objectivity or neutrality. Philosophy is about addressing the real, it is a form of ontology before it is capable of providing an epistemology.</p></div><div class="content" id="content"><p id="entry">Bergson understands that even the plant has an incipient consciousness, a vegetative consciousness that consists in the contraction and synthesis of the elements it requires. Even the plant, in other words, has habits, modes of repeated engagement with its environment. Even the plant has a kind of memory, embodied in its cellulose structure, and in the arrangement of roots, leaves, branches and flowers or fruits, a memory that gives it regularized forms of engagement with what it needs to continue to live. The plant, as Deleuze and Guattari understand, is on its way to a new kind of brain. It has already begun a brain-becoming, a mode of self-survey, of immediate self-proximity,17 in its very ability to discern and extract what it requires from what earth, sun and the various forces of the earth offer it: The plant contemplates by contracting the elements from which it originates – light, carbon, and the salts – and it fills itself with colors and odors that in each case qualify its variety, its composition: it is sensation in itself.</p></div><div class="content" id="content"><p id="entry">Habit, behaviour contracted into its first steps, is that which characterizes every temporal being, even the most resolutely unliving forms of matter. The crystal contracts the forces, the pressures that  transformed it into its present form: carbon is itself a cycle as much as a chemical, a movement from one form to another. This is the ‘ori- gin’ of what Deleuze understands as a kind of ‘non-organic life’, life without organs or organism. Contraction is how the very chemistry of the earth and the cosmos creates a brain for itself, a microbrain, a network of microbrains, a mode of connection and hesitation, a mode of openness or indeterminacy, for itself: Not every organism has a brain, and not all life is organic, but every- where there are forces that constitute microbrains, or an inorganic life of things.</p></div><div class="content" id="content"><p id="entry">Contraction is the condition of contemplation or self-survey: it is the becoming-brain even of objects which have no brain, the becoming-alive of that which is inorganic, the tendency to protract, to complicate and thus to open out, differentiate or actualize. Contraction preserves even that which does not act: and it detaches itself, as Bergson recognized, from either action or perception. Contraction can only function as detachment, as a kind of contempla- tion, a pause between one action or perception and another. Deleuze and Guattari here refer to that detachment that creates the possibility of contracting the past into the present, the possibility for forming habits. This possibility does not require a brain so much as create one, creating a series of brain-becomings that populate the universe as one of its virtual directions: the contraction that preserves is always in a state of detachment in relation to action or even to movement and appears as a pure contem- plation without knowledge.</p></div><div class="content" id="content"><p id="entry">It does not help us to order or regulate habits, for the goal of philosophy is not the transformation of behaviour so much as the creation of concepts which may or may not address any particular form of behaviour. It may thus be able to discern another dimension to habits than those that make habit the object of social manipulation. Habit is one of the modes of connection that link living beings to a world which is open to innovative behaviour: it is the link that bridges the relations between the organic and the inorganic, introdu- cing the needs of the organism to its environment and inserting its environment into the behaviour of the organism. Habit deserves to be understood not simply as one of the objects of social regulation, the attainment of good habits and the elimination of bad habits; it deserves to have its ontological place restored, to have this rich lineage which produced it as a philosophical concept contin- ued into the future. Understanding habit in terms beyond automatism implies a new understanding of the inorganic universe and a new understanding of its processes of generating, supporting and moving towards the organic, its becoming-brain.</p></div><div class="content" id="content"><p id="entry">Notes 1. As Catherine Malabou states in her introduction to a new English translation of Ravaisson: For beings subject to change, habit is the law of being. Without a general and permanent disposition, a ‘virtue’, which is developed as a result of change, as resistance to this change, the finite being cannot endure, would not have time to live. For such a being, being is fused with the habit of being. (Malabou in Ravaisson, 2008 [1838]: vii)</p></div></div>
