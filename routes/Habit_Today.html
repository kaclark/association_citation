        <div class="content" id="content"><p id="entry">Habit Today</p></div><div class="content" id="content"><p id="entry">Habit is a way in which we can organize lived regularities, moments of cohesion and repetition, in a universe in which nothing truly repeats, in which the past accu- mulates with unrelenting force, ensuring that no moment can ever resemble or repeat a previous moment because it already contains the past within it. For those who affirm perpetual change, Heraclitan variation or Bergsonian duration, habit is an anchor, the rock to which the possibilities of personal identity and freedom are tethered, the condition under which learning is possible, the creation of a direction, a ‘second nature’, an identity.</p></div><div class="content" id="content"><p id="entry">Ravaisson elaborates a new kind of vitalism, in which living beings (the higher the order the more there is a need for habit, a contraction or synthesis of past events) require the stability of habits to organize their world. While consid- ered a virtue, habits also the entail the possibility of a pathology.</p></div><div class="content" id="content"><p id="entry">Habit is change contracted, compressed, contained.</p></div><div class="content" id="content"><p id="entry">[Habit] thus anticipates a possible change. It is, in other words, a potentiality, a possibility, a virtual mode of addressing a future change. It is this that transforms it from an activ- ity to a disposition, or, as Ravaisson calls it, ‘a virtue’, a way of behaving in the world. Habit is a change in behaviour, a virtue that is activated whether it is called for or not, a permanent or semi- permanent modification of the agent of action</p></div><div class="content" id="content"><p id="entry">Habit is a degree of instinct, a modifiable, pliable, learned impulse to act. It functions mid-way between reflective decision-making with its time and effort, and instinct with its unerring but unchangeable responsiveness. Habit is the point of transition, the mode by which reflective or voluntary actions function as if they were instinctive. Habit is the movement by which effort and consideration is transformed into action. Habit performs a kind of condensation or compaction of bodily action, and a rationalization (and rationing) of the effort an act requires.</p></div><div class="content" id="content"><p id="entry">As a temporally ordering phenomenon, habit is the movement by which Aristotelian potentiality, or the virtual, is transformed into tendency, and tendency in turn is trans- formed into action. Habit is the action of ever-growing connection between the subject and the object of thought, it issues an ‘immediate intelligence’ that by-passes consciousness to produce effects around and through it. Habit is the movement by which ‘ idea becomes being ’ (2008 [1838]: 55), the trajectory by which tendency acts, potentiality makes and the virtual actualizes itself. Habit produces not only a tendency to act and the diminution of the tendency to feel; above all, it produces an ‘obscure intelligence’ that operates below the level of will, consciousness, intentionality or reflection, an intelligence in which all forms of life participate. This unconscious intelligence is what produces an intimate intuition, an attunement of the subject to the object, in which there are still two beings, two entities, an acting or sensing subject and an action performed or a sensation perceived, but entities that remain in the most intimate connection, mingled together with only the barest sliver of a difference between them. Thus habit does not arrest or mechanize, or reduce consciousness to unconsciousness or automatism; rather, it brings about a new kind of consciousness, one not aware of itself but prone to act, that is activated by the possibility of its acting, that knows but cannot know that it knows.</p></div><div class="content" id="content"><p id="entry">Rather than compulsion, habit expresses one’s openness to the future, along with one’s relation of connection to the past: it expresses the continuity of one’s attractions and desires, a cohesion that is endlessly open to modification (as instinct is not), to custom and to expectation. Habit is the accommodation of life to its most insistent and repetitive forces and tasks, life’s transformation through its engagement with a world larger than its will or consciousness.</p></div><div class="content" id="content"><p id="entry">There is a direct lineage between Ravaisson (and his predecessors) and the writings of Bergson. What Bergson found alluring in Ravaisson is both his understanding of the continual processes of change that make up the world in its temporal dimension, and his understanding of philosophy as a mode of attunement to the unique and the particular.</p></div></div>
