        <div class="content" id="content"><p id="entry">Bergson Metaphysics</p></div><div class="content" id="content"><p id="entry">the concept generalizes at the same time as it abstracts. The concept can only symbolize a particular property by making it common to an infinity of things. It therefore always more or less deforms the property by the extension it gives to it.</p></div><div class="content" id="content"><p id="entry">So that if we are bent on reconstructing the object with concepts some artifice must be sought whereby this coincidence of the object and its properties can be brought about.</p></div><div class="content" id="content"><p id="entry">a true empiricism is that which proposes to get as near to the original itself as possible th search  deeply into its life and so by a kind of intellectual auscultation  to feel the throbbing of its soul; and this true empiricism is the true metaphysics.</p></div><div class="content" id="content"><p id="entry">in the usual sense of the word “know” is to take ready-made concepts to portion them out and to mix them together until a practical equivalent of the reality is obtained. But it must be remembered that the normal work of the intellect is far from being disinterested. We do not aim generally at knowledge for the sake of knowledge but in order to take sides to draw profit – in short to satisfy an interest.</p></div><div class="content" id="content"><p id="entry">To try to fit a concept on an object is simply to ask what we can do with the object and what it can do for us. To label an object with a certain concept is to mark in precise terms the kind of action or attitude the object should suggest to us.</p></div><div class="content" id="content"><p id="entry">there is no state of mind however simple which does not change every moment since there is no consciousness without memory and no continuation of a state without the addition to the present feeling of the memory of past moments. It is this which constitutes duration.</p></div><div class="content" id="content"><p id="entry">the error consists in believing that we can reconstruct the real with these diagrams. As we have already said and may as well repeat here - from intuition one can pass to analysis but not from analysis to intuition.</p></div><div class="content" id="content"><p id="entry">The various concepts into which a change can be analyzed are therefore so many stable views of the instability of the real. And to think of an object - in the usual meaning of the word "think" - is to take one or more of these immobile views of its mobility.</p></div><div class="content" id="content"><p id="entry">To express it more clearly - if we consider duration under the simple aspect of a movement accomplishing itself in space and we seek to reduce to concepts movement considered as representative of time we shall have on the one hand as great a number of points on the trajectory as we may desire and on the other hand an abstract unity which holds them together as a thread holds together the pearls of a necklace.</p></div></div>
