Before the widespread adoption of the Hindu Numerals, letters doubled as numbers. That from which we craft poetry is at once capable of computation. Ibn Sina learned our Hindu Numerals in an esoteric context. The letter is powerful. Scrolls were a technology superior to rock engraving in some ways, but ultimately the codex emerged from history as the fire of the psychological. Today I have the great privilege to treat the codex as a data structure and to interface it with more recent data structures.<br>
