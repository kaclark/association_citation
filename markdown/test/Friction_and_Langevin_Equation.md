# FRICTION AND THE LANGEVIN EQUATION
One of the most familar examples of non-equilibrium behavior and dissipation is the phenomenon of friction. In particular, a particle pushed with a velocity v through a medium experiences frictional drag or force proportional to the velocity,
> f drag = -&gamma;v

Here, &gamma; is the friction constant. The presence of a velocity-dependent force implies that a fluid will absorb energy as one drags a particle dissipated, and the medium will heat up. In this section, we describe a model for frictional dissipation.
The particular model correpsonds to an oscillator or vibrating degree of freedom coupled to a bath. A schematic picture of the system is given in Fig. 8.12. The Hamiltonian we have in mind is

> H =  H0(x) - xf + Hb(y1,...,yN),

where H0 and Hb are the oscillator and bath Hamiltonians, respectively, the oscillator variable x is coupled to the multitude of bath variables y1, ..., yN through the force, f, which depends linearly upon the bath varibles,

> f = &sum; i (ci yi),

where the ci's are constants.

The oscillator and its coordinate, x, are the focus of our attention.
