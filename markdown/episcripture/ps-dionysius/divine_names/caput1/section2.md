> SECTION II.

Concerning this then, as has been said, the superessential and hidden   Deity, it is not permitted to speak or even to think beyond the things   divinely revealed to us in the sacred Oracles.
 For even as Itself has taught (as becomes Its goodness) in the Oracles, the science and   contemplation of Itself in Its essential Nature is beyond the reach of   all created things, as towering superessentially above all.
And you will find many of the Theologians, who have celebrated It, not only as invisible and incomprehensible, but also as inscrutable and   untraceable, since there is no trace of those who have penetrated to Its hidden infinitude.
The Good indeed is not entirely uncommunicated   to any single created being, but benignly sheds forth its superessential ray, persistently fixed in Itself, by illuminations analogous to each several being, and elevates to Its permitted   contemplation and communion and likeness, those holy minds, who, as far as is lawful and reverent, strive after It, and who are neither impotently boastful towards that which is higher than the harmoniously imparted Divine manifestation, nor, in regard to a lower level, lapse downward through their inclining to the worse, but who elevate   themselves determinately and unwaveringly to the ray shining upon them; and, by their proportioned love of permitted illuminations, are elevated with a holy reverence, prudently and piously, as on new wings.
