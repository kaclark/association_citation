# 9cite

If I wish to share an idea, I wish to share something of the texture of my experience. Literature is an extension of our being, our tastes, and so on. Memory extension and the lure of collective being is the highest art that a filesystem system can ascribe to.

Using the foundation of the philosophy of plan9 in order to build a citation system and scholastic memory expansion environment is the motivation for the relaunching of this site. This directory will stage the next phase of association citation as 9cite which is what the project will be called for here on. Association Citation remains the greater title, but all code and documentation will speak of 9cite.

Because the dialect of C that goes on to become Go was there for plan9, go tools will be used.

For now the website is run from a github page, but in time and with hope the git repo will be hosted from OpenBSD, as will the website. 9cite will also be the staging platform for this movement as well, after which case github will be a mirror

There is a developer frontend written in Shell and Go Binaries and a data processing backend written in the Python Interpreter for Rust Libraries. The developer go interface will be called particle and the backend will be called wave.

A word on location:

I have long wished to run association citation from my smartphone's termux. I still will. But I also now want to run it from the athena cluster at MIT for as long as I will have access. This very text is my first test of git pushing to my github repo. Later I will self-host, but for now this will do.
